s01e01	Winter is Coming	Easy, boy.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What do you expect? They're savages.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 One lot steals a goat from another lot, before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 How close did you get? - Close as any man would.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - We should head back to the Wall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Do the dead frighten you? Our orders were to track the wildlings.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We tracked them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They won't trouble us no more.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Whatever did it to them could do it to us.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They even killed the children.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It's a good thing we're not children.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You want to run away south, run away.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Of course, they will behead you as a deserter.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 If I don't catch you first.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Get back on your horse.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I won't say it again.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They were here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 See where they went.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What is it? It's Go on, Father's watching.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And your mother.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Fine work, as always.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Well done.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Thank you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I love the detail that you've managed to get in these corners.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Quite beautiful.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The stitching Oh, no, no, no.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 This stitch is very - It's beautiful.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Thank you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Go on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Don't think too much, Bran.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Relax your bow arm.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Quick, Bran! - Faster.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Lord Stark! My lady.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 A guardsman just rode in from the hills.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Get the lads to saddle their horses.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Do you have to? He swore an oath, Cat.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Law is law, my lady.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Tell Bran he's coming too.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Ned.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Ten is too young to see such things.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He won't be a boy forever.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And winter is coming.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Good lad, go run back and get the rest.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 White walkers.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I saw the white walkers.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 White walkers.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The white walkers, I saw them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I know I broke my oath.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And I know I'm a deserter.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them, but I saw what I saw.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I saw the white walkers.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 People need to know.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 If you can get word to my family tell them I'm no coward.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Tell them I'm sorry.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Forgive me, Lord.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, - the first of his name - Don't look away.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 King of the Andals and the First Men - Father will know if you do.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You did well.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You understand why I did it? Jon said he was a deserter.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 But do you understand why I had to kill him? "Our way is the old way"? The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Is it true he saw the white walkers? The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 So he was lying? A madman sees what he sees.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What is it? Mountain lion? There are no mountain lions in these woods.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It's a freak.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It's a direwolf.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Tough old beast.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Now there are five.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You want to hold it? Where will they go? Their mother's dead.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They don't belong down here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Better a quick death.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They won't last without their mother.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Right.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Give it here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - No! Put away your blade.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - I take orders from your father, not you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Please, Father! I'm sorry, Bran.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Lord Stark? There are five pups.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 One for each of the Stark children.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The direwolf is the sigil of your house.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They were meant to have them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You will train them yourselves.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You will feed them yourselves.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What about you? I'm not a Stark.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Get on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What is it? The runt of the litter.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 That one's yours, Snow.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you you worry too much.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - It's starting to show.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - And you never worry about anything.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock, you were never afraid.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 "We're Lannisters.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Lannisters don't act like fools.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	" - What if Jon Arryn told someone? - But who would he tell? My husband.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You should be the Hand of the King.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 That's an honor I can do without.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 All these years, and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You have five northern children.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You're not an outsider.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I wonder if the old gods agree.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It's your gods with all the rules.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I am so sorry, my love.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Tell me.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - There was a raven from King's Landing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Jon Arryn is dead.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 A fever took him.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I know he was like a father to you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Your sister, the boy? - They both have their health, gods be good.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The raven brought more news.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The king rides for Winterfell with the queen and all the rest of them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 If he's coming this far north there's only one thing he's after.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You can always say no, Ned.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - I'm told he reads all night.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - I'm told he drinks all night.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 How much could he possibly drink? A man of his stature? We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Perhaps we'll find out.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 In any case, candles.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king? It's for the queen, I bet.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Go on, Tommy, shear him good.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Gods, but they grow fast.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Brandon! I saw the king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He's got hundreds of people.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 How many times have I told you? No climbing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 But he's coming right now, down our road.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I want you to promise me, no more climbing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I promise.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Do you know what? - What? You always look at your feet before you lie.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Run and find your father.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Tell him the king is close.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister? - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Oh.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What are you doing with that on? Go on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Move! Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You've got fat.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Cat! - Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Nine years Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been? Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Winterfell is yours.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Where's the Imp? - Will you shut up? Who have we here? You must be Robb.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 My, you're a pretty one.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Your name is? Arya.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Oh, show us your muscles.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You'll be a soldier.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Would you please shut up? My queen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Take me to your crypt.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I want to pay my respects.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We've been riding for a month, my love.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Surely the dead can wait.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Ned.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Where's the Imp? Where is our brother? Go and find the little beast.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Tell me about Jon Arryn.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 One minute he was fine and then burned right through him, whatever it was.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I loved that man.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We both did.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He never had to teach you much, but me? You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - He showed me what was what.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Aye.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Don't look at me like that.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It's not his fault I didn't listen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I need you, Ned, down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Lord Eddard Stark I would name you the Hand of the King.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I'm not worthy of the honor.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I'm not trying to honor you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Damn it, Ned, stand up.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We were meant to rule together.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Well, it's not too late.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I have a son, you have a daughter.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We'll join our houses.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It is true what they say about the northern girls.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Did you hear the king's in Winterfell? I did hear something about that.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And the queen and her twin brother.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And the other brother? - The queen has two brothers? - There's the pretty one and there's the clever one.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Mmm I hear they call him the Imp.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I hear he hates that nickname.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I hear he's a drunken little lecher, prone to all manner of perversions.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Clever girl.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Have you? - Already? - Oh! The gods gave me one blessing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Don't get up.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - My lord.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother? You have much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 She has odd cravings, our sister.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 A family trait.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Don't leave me alone with these people.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And this is the first of many courses.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I thought you might say that.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 But since we're short on time Come on, girls.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 See you at sundown.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Close the door! Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 She was my sister.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 This is where she belongs.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 She belonged with me.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 In my dreams, I kill him every night.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It's done, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The Targaryens are gone.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Not all of them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Daenerys! Daenerys.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 There's our bride-to-be.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Look, a gift from Illyrio.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Touch it.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Go on, feel the fabric.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Mmm.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Isn't he a gracious host? We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Illyrio's no fool.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You still slouch.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Let them see.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You have a woman's body now.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I need you to be perfect today.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you? No.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It's too hot, my lady.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Where is he? The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, and his sister, Daenerys of House Targaryen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Khal Drogo has never been defeated.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And you will be his queen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Come forward, my dear.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Where is he going? - The ceremony is over.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - But he But he didn't say anything.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Did he like her? Trust me, Your Grace, if he didn't like her, we'd know.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 It won't be long now.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father's throne.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The people drink secret toasts to your health.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 They cry out for their true king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 When will they be married? Soon.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The Dothraki never stay still for long.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Is it true they lie with their horses? I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Do you take me for a fool? I take you for a king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Kings lack the caution of common men.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 My apologies if I've given offense.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I know how to play a man like Drogo.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I don't want to be his queen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I want to go home.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 So do I.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I want us both to go home, but they took it from us.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home? I don't know.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We go home with an army.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 With Khal Drogo's army.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly? Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He's so handsome.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait? Hush now.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Your father hasn't even said yes.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He'd have to leave home.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He'd have to leave me.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And so would you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You left your home to come here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And I'd be queen someday.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Please make Father say yes! - Sansa - Please, please! It's the only thing I ever wanted.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Fill that up! Boys, Rodrik, come on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Come on! Come here, you little beauty! Is he dead yet? Uncle Benjen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You got bigger.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Rode all day.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Why aren't you at the feast? Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Well, you're always welcome on the Wall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 So take me with you when you go back.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Jon - Father will let me if you ask him.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I know he will.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The Wall isn't going anywhere.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I'm ready to swear your oath.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You don't understand what you'd be giving up.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We have no families.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - None of us will ever father sons.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - I don't care about that.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You might, if you knew what it meant.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I'd better get inside, rescue your father from his guests.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 We'll talk later.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What are you doing back there? Preparing for a night with your family.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I've always wanted to see the Wall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You're Tyrion Lannister, the queen's brother? My greatest accomplishment.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you? Did I offend you? Sorry.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You are the bastard, though.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you the bastard.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Let me give you some advice, bastard.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Never forget what you are.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The rest of the world will not.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 What the hell do you know about being a bastard? All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You at a feast it's like a bear in a trap.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The boy I beheaded - did you know him? - Of course I did.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Just a lad.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 But he was tough, Ned, a true ranger.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 He was talking madness.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 The two he was with are still missing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Hmph.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 A wildling ambush.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Maybe.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Direwolves south of the Wall, talk of the walkers, and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Winter is coming.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Uncle Benjen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Robb boy.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - How are you? - I'm good.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace? Yes.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Lovely country.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Hello, little dove.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 But you are a beauty.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - How old are you? - Thirteen, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You're tall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Still growing? I think so, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 And have you bled yet? No, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Your dress, did you make it? Such talent.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 You must make something for me.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I hear the same.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Your daughter will do well in the capital.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Your pardon.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - I hear we might be neighbors soon.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - I hope it's true.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 - Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	 I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	You need to drink, child.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And eat.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lsn't there anything else? The Dothraki have two things in abundance - grass and horses.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 People can't live on grass.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 ln the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt murders all other grass.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything - that's the way the world will end.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt'll get easier.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Khaleesi! Your hands.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We're still not far from Pentos, Your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Master lllyrio has extended his hospitality.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You'd be more comfortable there.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l have no interest in hospitality or comfort.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and l have my crown.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 As you wish, Your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, l suppose it is preferable to beheading.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver? Selling to one.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Some poachers l caught on my land.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You can rest assured of that.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My mother's been looking for you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We ride for King's Landing today.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What good will my sympathies do them? None.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 But it is expected of you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Your absence has already been noted.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The boy means nothing to me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And l can't stand the wailing of women.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 One word and l'll hit you again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm telling Mother! Go! Tell her.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Do you understand? You can't Do you understand? The Prince will remember that, little lord.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l hope so.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lf he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Ah.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Time for breakfast.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Bread.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And two of those little fish.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And bacon, burnt black.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Hyah.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Little brother.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Beloved siblings.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 ls Bran going to die? Apparently not.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - What do you mean? - The maester says the boy may live.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Only the gods know for certain.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 All the rest of us can do is pray.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The charms of the North seem entirely lost on you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l still can't believe you're going.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's ridiculous, even for you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the white walkers.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 No, l just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The children don't need to hear your filth.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Come.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Give me a good, clean death any day.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Speaking for the grotesques, l'd have to disagree.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Death is so final, whereas life ah, life is full of possibilities.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l hope the boy does wake.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My dear brother, you wound me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You know how much l love my family.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Please.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Oh, l would have dressed, Your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 This is your home.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm your guest.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Handsome one, isn't he? l lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 He was a fighter too - tried to beat the fever that took him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Forgive me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's the last thing you need to hear right now.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l never knew.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt was years ago.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The boy looked just like him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Such a little thing.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 A bird without feathers.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 They came to take his body away and Robert held me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l screamed and l battled, but he held me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That little bundle.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 They took him away and l never saw him again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Never have visited the crypt, never.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l am grateful.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Perhaps this time she'll listen.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 A sword for the Wall? - l already have one.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Good man.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Have you swung it yet? - Of course l have.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 At someone, l mean.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood, and some bone to keep it all standing.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall - wildlings and white walkers and whatnot.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8,000 years.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 ls it "we" already? Have you taken your vows, then? Soon enough.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Give my regards to the Night's Watch.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And if not it's only for life.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Thank you, Nymeria.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Septa Mordane says l have to do it again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My things weren't properly folded, she says.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Who cares how they're folded? They're going to get all messed up anyway.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's good you've got help.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Watch.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Nymeria, gloves.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - lmpressive.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Shut up.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Nymeria, gloves! l have something for you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And it has to be packed very carefully.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 A present? Close the door.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 This is no toy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Be careful you don't cut yourself.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - lt's so skinny.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - So are you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l had the blacksmith make it for you special.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - l can be quick.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - You'll have to work at it every day.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 How does it feel? Do you like the balance? l think so.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l know which end to use.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm going to miss you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Careful.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 All the best swords have names, you know.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Sansa can keep her sewing needles.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l've got a needle of my own.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l came to say goodbye to Bran.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You've said it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l wish l could be here when you wake up.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm going north with Uncle Benjen.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm taking the black.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll know my way around by then.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l want you to leave.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 you rode off with Robert Baratheon.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You came back a year later with another woman's son.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And now you're leaving again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l have no choice.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That's what men always say when honor calls.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You do have a choice.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And you've made it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Cat l can't do it, Ned.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l really can't.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You can.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You must.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l know it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You Starks are hard to kill.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My mother? - She was very kind.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Good.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Next time l see you, you'll be all in black.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt was always my color.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Farewell, Snow.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And you, Stark.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And you are a Stark.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 ls my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where l am, where l'm going? Does she care? The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Hmm? l promise.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Gods, this is country! l've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l've half a mind to go with you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You should have asked me 20 years ago.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 There were wars to fight, women to marry - we never had the chance to be young.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l recall a few chances.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 There was that one Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Bessie.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 She was one of yours.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And her tits.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Yours was, er Aleena? No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You told me once.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Er Meryl? Your bastard's mother? - Wylla.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - That's it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You never told me what she looked like.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Nor will l.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We were at war.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You're too hard on yourself.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You always have been.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l swear if l weren't your king, you'd have hit me already.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The worst thing about your coronation - l'll never get to hit you again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Trust me, that's not the worst thing.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 There was a rider in the night.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What of it? Do we send her a wedding gift? A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 She's little more than a child.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Tell me we're not speaking of this.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family - that was unspeakable.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister - the woman l loved.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll kill every Targaryen l get my hands on.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 But you can't get your hands on this one, can you? This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 They have no ships, Robert.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lf the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, - the scum will join him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - He will not cross.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 There's a war coming, Ned.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l don't know when, l don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Sit.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You'll be fed.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Untie them.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Ah, rapers.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 They were given a choice, no doubt - castration or the Wall.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Most choose the knife.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch - you discard your old family and get a whole new one.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Why do you read so much? Look at me and tell me what you see.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 ls this a trick? What you see is a dwarf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lf l'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Alas, l was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Things are expected of me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Until your brother killed that king.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Yes, until my brother killed him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Life is full of these little ironies.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My sister married the new king, and my repulsive nephew will be king after him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l must do my part for the honor of my house.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and l have my mind, and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That's why l read so much, Jon Snow.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And you? What's your story, bastard? Ask me nicely and maybe l'll tell you, dwarf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The Night's Watch protects the realm from Ah, yes, yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You're a smart boy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You don't believe that nonsense.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Talk to Poole about it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require - our immediate attention.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - l don't care about appointments! l'll make the appointments.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Very good, my lord.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My lady.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 When was the last time you left this room? l have to take care of him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 He's not going to die, Mother.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What if he's wrong? - Bran needs me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Rickon needs you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 He's six.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 He doesn't know what's happening.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 He follows me around all day, - clutching my leg, crying - Close the windows! l can't stand it! Please make them stop! Fire.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You stay here.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll come back.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You're not supposed to be here.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 No one is supposed to be here.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's a mercy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 He's dead already.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 No! - Have you ever seen a dragon? - Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Everywhere? Even in the East? No dragon.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Brave men kill them.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - lt is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - lt is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 A trader from Qarth told me that dragons come from the moon.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The moon? He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat, and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Moon is no egg.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Moon is goddess - wife of sun.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - lt is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - lt is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Leave me with her.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Why did the trader from Qarth tell you these stories? Men like to talk when they're happy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Before your brother bought me for you, it was myjob to make men happy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 How old were you? l was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Nine?! l did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 First you must learn.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Can you teach me how to make the khal happy? Yes.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Will it take three years? No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Welcome.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What l am about to tell you must remain between us.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l don't think Bran fell from that tower.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l think he was thrown.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The boy was always surefooted before.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Someone tried to kill him twice.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Saw what, my lady? - l don't know.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 But l would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the Crown.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Did you notice the dagger the killer used? lt's too fine a weapon for such a man.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Someone gave it to him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 They come into our home and try to murder my brother? lf it's war they want lf it comes to that, you know l'll stand behind you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Hmm? Too easily words of war become acts of war.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 We don't know the truth yet.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Lord Stark must be told of this.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l don't trust a raven to carry these words.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - l'll ride to King's Landing.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - l will go myself.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Mother, you can't.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l must.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l don't want the Lannisters to know l'm coming.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Let me accompany you at least.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What about Bran? l have prayed to the Seven for more than a month.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Bran's life is in their hands now.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 No, Khaleesi.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You must look in his eyes always.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Love comes in at the eyes.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt is said that lrogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Finish a man? Oh.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Kings traveled across the world for a night with lrogenia.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Magisters sold their palaces.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Well, she sounds like an interesting woman.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l l don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You will make him like it, Khaleesi.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Men want what they've never had.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Very good, Khaleesi.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Out there he is the mighty khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l l don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lf he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you? No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 No! Tonight l would look upon your face! Pardon me, ser.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Do l frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Look at that face.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm sorry if l offended you, ser.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Why won't he speak to me? He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Since the Mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 He speaks damn well with his sword though.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Ser llyn Payne, the King's Justice.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The Royal Executioner.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You're scaring my lady.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l don't like to see you upset.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The sun's finally shining.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Come walk with me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Stay, Lady.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l probably shouldn't have any more.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My princess can drink as much as she wants.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Don't worry.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You're safe with me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll get you! Arya! Ow! What are you doing here? - Go away.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Your sister? - And who are you, boy? - Mycah, my lord.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - He's the butcher's boy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - He's my friend.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 A butcher's boy who wants to be a knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Let's see how good you are.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 She asked me to, my lord.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 She asked me to.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'm your prince, not your lord, and l said pick up your sword.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's not a sword, my prince.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 lt's only a stick.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 And you're not a knight.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Only a butcher's boy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Do you know that? - Stop it! - Arya, stay out of this.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l won't hurt him much.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Arya! Filthy little bitch! No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you! You're spoiling it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You're spoiling everything! l'll gut you, you little cunt! - Arya! - Nymeria! Arya! Nymeria! No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Please don't.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Arya, leave him alone.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Stay here.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l'll go back to the inn and bring help.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Then go! Don't touch me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The wolf's not here.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Look down by the stream.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You've got to go.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Go on.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Run.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Go! Leave now! - lt's a direwolf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - l'll check down here.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l think l heard a noise.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Go! Arya! Arya! Arya! Arya! Arya! Arya! My lord! My Lord! They've found her.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - She's unharmed.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Arya! - Where is she? - She's been taken directly before the king.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Who took her? - The Lannisters found her.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Arya! - Right, get back.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 The queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Back! Back to the inn! All back! l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Are you hurt? - No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Oh, it's all right.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once? How dare you speak to your king in that manner? Quiet, woman.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Sorry, Ned.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 l never meant to frighten the girl.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 But we need to get this business done quickly.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That's not true! She just bit him a little.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - He was hurting Mycah.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Joff told us what happened.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 That's not what happened! Yes, it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 - Liar! - Shut up! Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Seven hells! What am l to make of this? - Where's your other daughter, Ned? - ln bed, asleep.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 She's not.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	 Sansa, come here, darling.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Welcome, Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The honor of your presence is requested.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Get the girls settled in.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I'll be back in time for supper.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - And, Jory, you go with them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Yes, my lord.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 If you'd like to change into something more appropriate Thank the gods you're here, Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 About time we had some stern northern leadership.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Sturdy old thing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How many kings' arses have polished it, I wonder? Um, what's the line? The king shits and the Hand wipes.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Very handsome armor.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Not a scratch on it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I know.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I have a knack for it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It must be strange for you, coming into this room.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I was standing right here when it happened.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He was very brave, your brother.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Your father, too.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 They didn't deserve to die like that.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Nobody deserves to die like that.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 But you just stood there and watched.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 was silent as a crypt.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And later when I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned It felt like justice.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back? Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more? You served him well when serving was safe.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Lord Varys.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Renly! You're looking well.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And you look tired from the road.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I told them this meeting could wait another day, but But we have a kingdom to look after.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - She has, Lord Baelish.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 All too well.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It was Catelyn Tully.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Grand Maester.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How many years has it been? - You were a young man.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - And you served another king.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Oh, how forgetful of me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 This belongs to you now.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Should we begin? - Without the king? - Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 His Grace has many cares.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We are the lords of small matters here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Mm, how much? - 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, Can the treasury bear such expense? I'll have to borrow it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 What's another 80,000? Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt? - I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - How could you let this happen? The master of coin finds the money.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The king and the Hand spend it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 "Counting coppers," he calls it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I'll speak to him tomorrow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 As you will.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 But still, we'd best make our plans.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 There will be no plans until I speak to Robert.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Forgive me, my lords.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I'm - I had a long ride.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We serve at your pleasure.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Ow! - Please, it's nearly healed.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - It's ugly.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - A king should have scars.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You fought off a direwolf.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're a warrior like your father.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I'm not like him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I didn't fight off anything.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It bit me and all I did was scream.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 That's not true.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You killed the beast.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I didn't, I When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Do I have to marry her? Yes.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 She's very beautiful and young.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Do something nice for the Stark girl.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I don't want to.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - No, but you will.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We allow the northerners too much power.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 They consider themselves our equals.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How would you handle them? I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A royal army? Why should every lord command his own men? We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers, instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And if the northerners rebel? I'd crush them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the North.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Uncle Kevan, maybe.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord? - For me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I'm their king.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Mm-hm.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 But you've just invaded their homeland, - asked them to kill their brothers.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I'm not asking.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The North cannot be held, not by an outsider.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It's too big and too wild.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And when the winter comes, the seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A good king knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 So you agree the Starks are enemies? Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Enough of that, young lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Eat your food.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I'm practicing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Practicing for what? - The prince.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Arya, stop! He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The Hound killed your friend.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The Hound does whatever the prince tells him to do.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - You're an idiot.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - You're a liar, and if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Enough! What's happening here? Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Go to your room.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We'll speak later.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 That's for you, love.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Don't you like it? I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - May I be excused? - You've barely eaten a thing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It's all right.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Go on.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 War was easier than daughters.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Go away! Arya, open the door.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 May I come in? - Whose sword is that? - Mine.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Give it to me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I know this maker's mark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 This is Mikken's work.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Where did you get this? This is no toy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I wasn't playing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And I don't want to be a lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Come here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Now what do you want with this? It's called Needle.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Oh, a blade with a name.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting? Stick 'em with the pointy end.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 That's the essence of it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I was trying to learn.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I asked Mycah to practice with me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I asked him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It was my fault.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 No, sweet girl.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I hate them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I hate all of them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The Hound, the queen and the king and Joffrey and Sansa.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Sansa was dragged before the king and queen and asked to call the prince a liar.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 So was I! He is a liar.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Shh, darling, listen to me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 She cannot betray him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 She must take his side even when he's wrong.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 But how you can let her marry someone like that? Well Look at me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're a Stark of Winterfell.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You know our words.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Winter is coming.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You were born in the long summer.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You've never known anything else.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 But now winter is truly coming.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Sansa is your sister.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I don't hate her.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Not really.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We've come to a dangerous place.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 All right? Go on.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It's yours.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I can keep it? Try not to stab your sister with it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Don't listen to it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Crows are all liars.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I know a story about a crow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I hate your stories.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I know a story about a boy who hated stories.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Those were always your favorites.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Those weren't my favorites.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 My favorites were the scary ones.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Oh, my sweet summer child.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die, all in darkness.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the white walkers move through the woods.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the white walkers came for the first time.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds What are you telling him now? Only what the little lord wants to hear.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Get your supper.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I want some time with him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Maybe we do.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 In the wind, in the rain A thousand times.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - You never fall.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I did though.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It's true, isn't it, what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Don't ever say that.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I'd rather be dead.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Fewer eyes back here, my lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 But still too many.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And no one knew who I was the last time I came, either.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 My lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Would you mind following us? I would.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We've done nothing wrong.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but Follow me, Lady Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Cat! Go on.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Go upstairs.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a Pssst! I meant no disrespect, to you of all people.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How dare you bring me here? Have you lost your mind? No one will come looking for you here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Isn't that what you wanted? I'm truly sorry about the locale.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How did you know I was coming to King's Landing? A dear friend told me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Lady Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Lord Varys.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 To see you again after so many years is a blessing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Your poor hands.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How did you know I was coming? Knowledge is my trade, my lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere even in the North.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 They whisper to me the strangest stories.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Valyrian steel.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Do you know whose dagger this is? I must admit I do not.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Well, well, this is an historic day.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Something you don't know that I do.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - It's mine.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Yours? At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 To whom? Tyrion Lannister.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The Imp.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Pyp.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us? Next! Next! Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Go clean yourselves up! There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A charming man.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I don't need him to be charming.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And how's that going, Commander Mormont? Slowly.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Good news or bad? Both.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I meant to give you this earlier.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 So forgetful these days.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A raven from Winterfell this morning.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - My wife is in Winterfell.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Is she? Yes, I'm looking at you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I thought that she'd be safest in here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 One of several such establishments I own.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're a funny man.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Huh? A very funny man.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Ned! Ah, the Starks Quick tempers, slow minds.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You broke my nose, bastard! It's an improvement.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 What are you looking at, halfman? I'm looking at you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Yes.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You've got an interesting face.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Hmm, very distinctive faces.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 All of you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And what do you care about our faces? It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Perhaps I'll write to my sister, the queen, about it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 No one but you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 My father knew and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Grenn's father left him too outside a farmhouse, when he was three.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He was given a choice - his right hand or the Wall.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I've been asking the Lord Commander about them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Fascinating stories.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 They hate me because I'm better than they are.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I don't imagine any of them had ever held a real sword before they came here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Oh Your brother Bran.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He's woken up.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The mere suggestion that the queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We have proof.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We have the blade.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Petyr has promised to help us find the truth.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He would never betray my trust.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I won't forget this.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're a true friend.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Don't tell anyone.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I have a reputation to maintain.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - How could you be so stupid? - Calm down.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He's a child.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Ten years old.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - What were you thinking? - I was thinking of us.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're a bit late to start complaining about it now.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - What has the boy told them? - Nothing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He remembers nothing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Then what are you raving about? What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw We'll say he was lying.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We'll say he was dreaming.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We'll say whatever we like.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - And my husband? - I'll go to war with him if I have to.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 They can write a ballad about us - "The War For Cersei's Cunt.
s01e03	Lord Snow	" - Let me go.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Never.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Let me go.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - The boy won't talk.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And if he does, I'll kill him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Him, Ned Stark, the king - the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I wish I could see the girls.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - It's too dangerous.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Just for a moment.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Until we know who our enemies are.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I know they did it, Ned.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 The Lannisters.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 In my bones, I know it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Littlefinger's right.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I can't do anything without proof.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 And if you find the proof? Then I bring it to Robert and hope he's still the man I once knew.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He still loves you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Does he? Off with you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Yes, it's been a long time.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 But I still remember every face.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You remember your first? Of course, Your Grace.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Who was it? A Tyroshi.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Never learned the name.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Hmm.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 How did you do it? Lance through the heart.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Quick one.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Lucky for you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I knocked him down with the hammer.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Gods, I was strong then.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Caved in his breastplate.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Probably shattered every rib he had.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Stood over him, hammer in the air.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait.
s01e03	Lord Snow	" They never tell you how they all shit themselves.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 They don't put that part in the songs.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Stupid boy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys, and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Wine! Lancel Lannister.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing? - It's empty, Your Grace.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - What do you mean, it's empty? - There's no more wine.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Is that what empty means?! So get more.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Tell your cousin to get in here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Kingslayer! Get in here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Surrounded by Lannisters.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 So come on.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We're telling war stories.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Who was your first kill, not counting old men? One of the outlaws in the brotherhood.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I was there that day.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You were only a squire, 16 years old.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Best move I ever saw.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Your outlaw any last words? - I cut his head off, so no.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - Hmm.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve? He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours "Burn them all.
s01e03	Lord Snow	" If that's all, Your Grace Do the Dothraki buy their slaves? The Dothraki don't believe in money.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 From whom? If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices - pay tribute or fight.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 An easy choice for most.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Of course, sometimes it's not enough.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Sometimes a khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Tell them all to stop.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You want the entire horde to stop? For how long? Until I command them otherwise.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're learning to talk like a queen.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Not a queen.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 A khaleesi.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I don't take orders from savages or their sluts.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Do you hear me? Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 No.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Please.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Please, don't hurt him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 Huh? Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your king! Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi? Uh uh uh uh uh.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You walk.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - I'm leaving this morning.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - You're leaving? I'm the First Ranger.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 My job is out there.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - There have been disturbing reports.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - What kind of reports? The kind I don't want to believe.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I'm ready.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 I won't let you down.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're not going.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 You're no ranger, Jon.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 - But I'm better than every - Better than no one! Here a man gets what he earns, when he earns it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	 We'll speak when I return.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	The little lord's been dreaming again.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - We have visitors.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I don't want to see anyone.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Anyway, you don't have a choice.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Robb's waiting.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I don't want to go.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Neither do I.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hodor! - Hodor? - Help Bran down the hall.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hodor.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy? I'm not your boy, Lannister.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 So it's true.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hello, Bran.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you remember anything about what happened? He has no memory of that day.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Curious.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why are you here? Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? - My neck is beginning to hurt.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Kneel, Hodor.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Do you like to ride, Bran? - Yes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Well, I mean I did like to.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - The boy has lost the use of his legs.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I'm not a cripple.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Then I'm not a dwarf.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 My father will rejoice to hear it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I have a gift for you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Give that to your saddler.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He'll provide the rest.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You must shape the horse to the rider.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Will I really be able to ride? - You will.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him? I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You've done my brother a kindness.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 There's a brothel outside your walls.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Couldn't resist some northern arse? If you like Redheads, ask for Ros.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - He's not my master.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - No, of course not.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What happened here? Where is Lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me? - She wasn't feeling well.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - She's not in Winterfell, is she? - Where did she go? - M'lady's whereabouts M'lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I believe your uncles were responsible.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Must have been a pretty sight.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yes, a great victory for your people.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Shame how it all turned out.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - We were outnumbered ten to one.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - A stupid rebellion, then.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Now here you are, your enemy's squire.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Careful, Imp.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I've offended you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Forgive me, it's been a rough morning.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Anyway, don't despair.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Your next tumble with Ros is on me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'll try not to wear her out.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Shoulder, legs.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Leg, shoulder, leg.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Left foot forward.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Good.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Put all your weight behind it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What in seven hells is that? They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Tell them your name.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill I mean, I was of Horn Hill.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I've come to take the black.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Come to take the black pudding.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Rast see what he can do.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I yield.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Please, no more.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - On your feet.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Pick up your sword.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hit him till he finds his feet.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Jon! Again, harder.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I yield! - Enough! He yielded.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Looks like the bastard's in love.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 All right then, Lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You two.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 All you've got to do is get past the bastard.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Are you sure you want to do this? - No.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yield, yield, yield! I yield.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 We're done for today.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Go clean the armory.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 That's all you're good for.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Well fought! - Piss off.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Did he hurt you? - I've had worse.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You can call me Sam if you want.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - My mother calls me Sam.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - It's not going to get any easier, you know? - You're going to have to defend yourself.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why didn't you get up and fight? I wanted to.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I just couldn't.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why not? I'm a coward.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - My father always says so.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - The Wall's no place for cowards.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You're right.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm sorry.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I just wanted to thank you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 A bloody coward.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 People saw us talking to him.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Now they'll think we're cowards too.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You're too stupid to be a coward.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - You're too stupid to be a - Quick now, before summer's over.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Come here! Hyah, hyah! Vaes Dothrak - the city of the horselords.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 A pile of mud.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Mud and shit and twigs.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Best these savages can do.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - These are my people now.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - You shouldn't call them savages.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I'll call them what I like, because they're my people.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 This is my army.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms? The Dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They fear any water their horses can't drink.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But if they did? King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - And you know these men? - I fought beside them once, long ago.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Now Ned Stark wants my head.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He drove me from my land.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You sold slaves.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Aye.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why? - I had no money and an expensive wife.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And where is she now? In another place, with another man.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Your Grace? - Yes, my dear? They call you the last dragon They do.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You have dragon's blood in your veins? It's entirely possible.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The brave men didn't kill dragons.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The brave men rode them.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them melted together like so many candles.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I have always wanted to see a dragon.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 There's nothing in the world that I would rather see.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Really.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Why dragons? They can fly.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else far away.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And they can kill.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Ow.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I was not locked in.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I have seen things.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - What have you seen? - I've seen a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Ooh.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 So have you seen one? - A pirate ship? - A dragon.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 No.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 No, the last one died many years before I was born.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'll tell you what I have seen - their skulls.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But But as you got closer to the Iron Throne they got bigger and bigger and bigger.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius Archonei, Meraxes, Vhagar and Balerion the Dread whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What happened to the skulls? I don't know.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Scattered to the wind.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - That's very sad.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Yes, it is.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What did I buy you for? - To make me sad? - No, Your Grace.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 To, uh, teach your sister.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? Oh, you pretty little idiot.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Go on, then.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Get on with it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - What if I have a girl? - Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What if I only have girls? I wouldn't worry about that.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Jeyne Poole's mother had five children - all of them girls.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But what if? Well, if you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And everyone would hate me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Nobody could ever hate you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Joffrey does.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Nonsense.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? Sansa I've told you a hundred times - - a direwolf is not - Please shut up about it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you remember your lessons? - Who built the Iron Throne? - Aegon the Conqueror.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - And who built the Red Keep? - Maegor the Cruel.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And how many years did it take to build My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they? They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - The Mad King.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Commonly known as the Mad King.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Why were they killed? You should speak to your father about these matters.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I don't want to speak to my father, ever.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Sansa, you will find it in your heart - to forgive your father.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - No, I won't.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It's the Hand's Tournament that's causing all this trouble, my lords.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The King's Tournament.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Dreadful.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - If you can't keep the king's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I need more men.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - You'll get 50.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I will? You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'll also give you - till the crowds have left.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They will be put to good use.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The sooner this is over, the better.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The realm prospers from such events, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Hmm.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Now if there's nothing else, my lords? Oh, this heat.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 On days like this, I envy you northerners, your summer snows.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Until tomorrow, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Lord Arryn? Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 His sickness struck him very hard and very fast.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why? I have been grand maester for many years.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since What did Jon want the night before he died? Oh, he came inquiring after a book.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 A book? What book? Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 A A ponderous tome.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 No, I'd like to read it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the Last Hearth.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 As I said, my lord, a ponderous read.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it? He did not, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And I did not presume to ask.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Jon's death - Such a tragedy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 did he say anything to you during his final hours? Nothing of import, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Oh.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 There was one phrase he kept repeating.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 "The seed is strong," I think it was.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - "The seed is strong"? - Mmm.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - What does that mean? - Oh, the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness? What else could it be? - Poison.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - A disturbing thought.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 No, no, no, I don't think it likely.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The Hand was loved by all.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What sort of man would dare I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yes, women, cravens and eunuchs.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch? - Everybody knows that.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Yes, yes, of course.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 How that sort of person found himself - on the king's council, I will never know.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I've taken enough of your time.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 No trouble at all, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It's a great honor.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Thank you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'll find my own way out.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It's a hard fall down these steps.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Cats? Syrio says.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He says every swordsman should study cats.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They're as quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - You have to be quick to catch them.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - He's right about that.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Now that Bran's awake, will he come live with us? Well, he needs to get his strength back first.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - He can't be one now, can he? - No.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king's council.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Can I be lord of a holdfast? You will marry a high lord and rule his castle.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Hmm? - No.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 That's not me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hello.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Come stand by the fire.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - It's warmer.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - No, that's all right.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm fine.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You're not.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You're freezing.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I don't like high places.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You can't fight.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You can't see.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What are you doing here, Sam? On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 "You're almost a man now," he said.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 "But you're not worthy of my land and title.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 "Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, "forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 "If you do not," he said, "then we'll have a hunt "and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble "and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 "Or so I'll tell your mother.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 "Nothing would please me more.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he? Yes, he is.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm not going to get any better, you know.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Well you can't get any worse.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I hear you're reading a boring book.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hmph.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Pycelle talks too much.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Oh, he never stops.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Until recently, he was only a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Knighted for what? - Why are you telling me this? - I promised Cat that I'd help you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Where is Ser Hugh? - I'll speak to him.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - A singularly bad idea.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Now look there.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 That one belongs to the queen.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And do you see that septa pretending to read her book? - Varys or the queen? - No, she's one of mine.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely? - Yes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - The wiser answer was no, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Get a message to this paragon of yours - discreetly.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Send him to question Ser Hugh.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why? - I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 22, 23, - 28, 29 - Ser Hugh? - Ser Hugh! - As you can see, I'm busy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I'm the captain of his guard.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I'm sorry.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I didn't catch your name, Ser - No "ser".
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'm not a knight.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I see.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Well, it just so happens that I am.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - He's a knight, you see.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Ah, a knight.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They strut around like roosters down here.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You shouldn't be out here, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - There's no telling who has eyes where.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Let them look.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The former Hand did call on me, my lord, several times.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - What did Lord Arryn want? - He always came to see the boy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I'd like to see him as well.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - As you wish, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Gendry! Here he is.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Strong for his age.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He works hard.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - This is fine work.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - It's not for sale.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Boy, this is the King's Hand! - If his lordship wants the helmet - I made it for me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Forgive him, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - There's nothing to forgive.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about? He just asked me questions is all, my lord.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What kind of questions? About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But then he started asking me about my mother.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Your mother? - Who she was, what she looked like.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What did you tell him? She died when I was little.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 She had yellow hair.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 She'd sing to me sometimes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Look at me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Get back to work, lad.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 If the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Find anything? King Robert's bastard son.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He likes that.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 This is for the king from Lord Stark.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Should I leave it with Shhh.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Listen.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Huh? - Guess.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Three.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Four.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He likes to do this when I'm on duty.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Forgive me, my lord - Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me? - We've met before, you know.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The siege of Pyke.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 We fought side by side one afternoon.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Ah.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - That's where you got your scar? - Aye.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Oh.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Vicious sons of whores.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - They like their bloodshed.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They stopped liking it at the end.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 That was a proper battle.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach? With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Theon? He's a good lad.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I doubt it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Come here.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I don't serve Lord Stark.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Where have you been? - Watch duty.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - With Sam.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Ah, Prince Porkchop.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Where is he? - He wasn't hungry.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Impossible! That's enough.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Sam's no different from the rest of us.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Never again, no matter what Thorne says.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You are in love, Lord Snow.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You girls can do as you please.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 No one touches Sam.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What are you waiting for? Attack him! You get in there.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hit me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yield.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I yield.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy? You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head! Forgive me, Khaleesi.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I did as you asked.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Hush now.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It's all right.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Irri, take her and leave us.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yes, Khaleesi.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why did you hit her?! - How many times do I have to tell you? - You do not command me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I wasn't commanding you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I just wanted to invite you to supper.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - What's this? - It's a gift.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I had it made for you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Dothraki rags? - Are you going to dress me now? - Please.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 This stinks of manure.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 All of it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Stop.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Stop.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Stop it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? - Next you'll want to braid my hair.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - You've no right to a braid.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - You've won no victories yet.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - You do not talk back to me! You are a horselord's slut.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And now you've woken the dragon I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I wouldn't doubt it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little Sally on the side? - Sally on the side? - It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? - It's absurd.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Why not? Because I'm fat? - No.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - But I like girls just as much as you do.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They might not like me as much.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I've never been with one.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You've probably had hundreds.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 No.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yeah.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yeah, I I find that hard to believe.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I came very close once.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but - Didn't know where to put it? - I know where to put it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Was she old and ugly? Young and gorgeous.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 A whore named Ros.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What color hair? - Red.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Oh, I like red hair.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And her, um Her - You don't want to know.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - What, that good? - Better.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Oh, no.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect? - What's my name? - Jon Snow.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And why is my surname Snow? Because you're a bastard from the North.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I never met my mother.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 My father wouldn't even tell me her name.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I don't know if she's living or dead.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife or a whore.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But I couldn't do it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Ah, mmm.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 So you didn't know where to put it? Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It is a bit nippy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It's still summer.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built? - I build my own fires.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - That's admirable.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 It was supposed to be a two-week mission.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 So we went out to look for some of his men - capture them, gather some knowledge.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Harder than you'll ever be.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They know their country better than we do.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They knew there was a storm coming in.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And we got caught in the open.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And all in darkness.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You don't know cold.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Neither of you do.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The horses died first.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Eating the horses was easy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But later when we started to fall That wasn't easy.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones left over for soup.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment, and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 You're boys still.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 And come the winter you will die like flies.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I hit him.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I hit the dragon.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - He is still the true king.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - The truth now.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne? No.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 But the common people are waiting for him.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They don't care what games the high lords play.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 What do you pray for, Ser Jorah? Home.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I pray for home too.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He'll never take us home.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Lovers' quarrel? I'm sorry.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Do I? Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - He's known - An old friend of the family.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I've known your mother a long, long time.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - Why do they call you Littlefinger? - Arya! - Don't be rude! - No, it's quite all right.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 When I was a child, I was very small, and I come from a little spit of land called the Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself! Gods, who's that? Ser Gregor Clegane.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 They call him the Mountain.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The Hound's older brother.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - And his opponent? - Ser Hugh of the Vale.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 He was Jon Arryn's squire.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Look how far he's come.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Yes, yes, enough of the bloody pomp.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Have at him! Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire - Gregor's toy, a wooden knight.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 There aren't very many people who know that story.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - I won't tell anyone.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 I promise.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 - No, please don't.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.
s01e04	Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things	 My lord, Her Grace the queen.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital? No.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I stood vigil for him myself last night.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He had no one else.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He'd never worn this armor before.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Bad luck for him - going against the Mountain.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Who determines the draw? All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Aye.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Life is strange.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 As is my wife.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're too modest.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He was a fine man, your father.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And that lad - he was a squire until a few months ago.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 How could he afford a new suit of armor? Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? - I hear the king wants to joust today.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Yes, that will never happen.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Robert tends to do what he wants.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If the king got what he wanted all the time, he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It's made too small, Your Grace.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It won't go.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You're too fat for your armor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king? Oh, it's funny, is it? - No, Your Grace.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - No? You don't like the Hand's joke? You're torturing the poor boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You heard the Hand.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The king's too fat for his armor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Go find the breastplate stretcher - now! "The breastplate stretcher"? How long before he figures it out? - Maybe you should have one invented.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - All right, all right.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You watch me out there.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I still know how to point a lance.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You've no business jousting.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Leave that for the young men.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Why, because I'm king? Piss on that.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I want to hit somebody! - And who's going to hit you back? - Anybody who can.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - And the last man in his saddle - Will be you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Are you telling me those cowards would let me win? Aye.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Drink.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I'm not thirsty.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Drink.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Your king commands it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Gods, too fat for my armor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Your squire - a Lannister boy? Mm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 "Cersei Lannister will make a good match," he told me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 "You'll need her father on your side.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" I thought being king meant I could do whatever I wanted.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Enough of this.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Let's go watch 'em ride.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 At least I can smell someone else's blood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Robert.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - What? Oh.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come, bow before your king! Bow, you shits! - Where's Arya? - At her dancing lessons.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The Knight of the Flowers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Thank you, Ser Loras.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Hey.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I can't watch.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I'll take that bet.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys? - Or you could even buy a friend.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - He's going to die.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Ser Loras rides well.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Such a shame, Littlefinger.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend? Loras knew his mare was in heat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Quite crafty, really.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Ser Loras would never do that.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - There's no honor in tricks.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - No honor and quite a bit of gold.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Sword! Leave him be! Stop this madness in the name of your king! Let him go! I owe you my life, ser.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm no ser.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Remove his hood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	  On that eve, the captive Imp  Downwards from his horse did limp  No more would he preen and primp  In garb of red and gold  This isn't the Kingsroad.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You said we were riding for Winterfell.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I did Often and loudly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Very wise.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Word's probably gotten to my father by now.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He'll be offering a handsome reward.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Would you be so good as to untie me? - And why would I do that? - Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Unless a shadowcat ate me first.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Ah, the eastern road.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We're going to the Vale.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister? - Five years ago.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - She's changed.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 She was always a bit touched, but now You might as well kill me here.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I am not a murderer, Lannister.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Neither am I.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - The dagger found - What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade? - Should I gag him? - Why? Am I starting to make sense? Rodrik! My lady, this way.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Untie me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If I die, what's the point? Ah! - Rodrik? - I'll be fine, my lady.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 There's no need to bloody yourself.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Your first? You need a woman.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Nothing like a woman after a fight.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm willing if she is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Bran.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The Iron Islands.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Sigil - a kraken.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Words - "We do not sow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" - Lords? - The Greyjoys.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And failed rebellions.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Sigil - a stag, a crowned stag now that Robert's king.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Good.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Words - "Ours is the fury.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" - Lords - the Baratheons.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Mm-hm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The Westerlands.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Sigil - a lion.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Mmm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" - No.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A common saying, but not their official motto.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Lords - the Lannisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - We're still on their words.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I don't know them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You do know them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Think.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 "Unbowed, unbent, unbroken.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" - That's House Martell.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - "Righteous in wrath.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" - House Hornwood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - "Family, duty, honor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" Those are Tully words - your mother's.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Are we playing a game? - Family, duty, honor - Is that the right order? - You know it is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Family comes first? Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 How can she protect the family if she's not with her family? Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And then she left! When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I placed you in her arms.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Absolutely.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Fiercely.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Why did she leave? I still can't tell you, - but she will be home soon.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Do you know where she is now? Today? - No, I don't.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon? Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'll never shoot another arrow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And where is that written? - You need legs to work a bow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Hmm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Really? Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Why shouldn't you? Shh, keep it down.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Important enough for the likes of you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Who, the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Jealous? Why should I be jealous? Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Might surprise you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Hmm? He's good with his fingers too.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And his tongue.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Generous tipper.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You are jealous.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm a Greyjoy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And what about the Starks? I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A ward - that's a nice word for it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again My father fought for the freedom of his people.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're a very serious boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I'm not a boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Oh, yes, you are.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A serious boy with a serious cock.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I don't want to pay for it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Then get yourself a wife.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Come on.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm not gonna hurt you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 How is your son, my lord? He'll never walk again.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But his mind is sound? So they say.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A blessing, then.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I suffered an early mutilation myself.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Some doors close forever others open in most unexpected places.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 May I? If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But there are things you must know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You are the King's Hand and the king is a fool - your friend, I know, but a fool - and doomed unless you save him.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I've been in the capital a month.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Why have you waited so long to tell me this? I didn't trust you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 So why do you trust me now? The queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 There are few men of honor in the capital.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You are one of them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What sort of doom does the king face? The same sort as Jon Arryn.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The tears of lys, they call it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It leaves no trace.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Who gave it to him? Some dear friend, no doubt.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But which one? There were many.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 There was one boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The squire, Ser Hugh? Pity, what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If Ser Hugh poisoned him who paid Ser Hugh? - Someone who could afford it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Jon was a man of peace.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He was Hand for 17 years - Why kill him? He started asking questions.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He's found one bastard already.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He has the book.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The rest will come.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And when he knows the truth, what will he do? The gods alone know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The fools tried to kill his son.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What's worse - they botched it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - We will be at war soon, my friend.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - What good is war now? We're not ready.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If one Hand can die, why not a second? This Hand is not the other.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We need time.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You know what these savages are.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - "Delay," you say.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 "Move fast," I reply.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 This is no longer a game for two players.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It never was.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The first to arrive and the last to leave.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I admire your industry.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You do move quietly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We all have our qualities.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You look a bit lonely today.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - First boy is on the house.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I think you're mistaking - business with pleasure.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear - such pretty little things.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Oh, I'm sure.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion - both equally important.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees? All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the king's laws.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Strictly speaking.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Tell me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Do you know, I have no idea where they are.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And we had been so close.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But enough about me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 How have you been since we last saw each other? Since you last saw me or since I last saw you? Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Saw me with your own eyes? - Eyes I own.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Council business.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion to think a simple word to the queen - One shudders at the thought.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Ooh.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Have you? - Yes.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Was that you under the bed? And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary Council business? Of course, you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're from there yourself, after all.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the king might question my friend's sympathies.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right loyalty to the realm - Oh, please.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - To find myself in a position where a simple word to the king What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - My brother is coming.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - To a small council meeting? Disturbing news from far away.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Hadn't you heard? Off with you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 No begging.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm not a beggar.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I live here.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing? I want to see my father.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I want to fuck the queen, for all the good it does me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing? You know I had half my guard out searching for you? - You promised me this would stop.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - They said they were going to kill you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Who did? - I didn't see them, - but I think one was fat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Oh, Arya.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage Something about the savage.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Where did you hear this? - In the dungeons, - near the dragon skulls.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - What were you doing in the dungeons? Chasing a cat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Pardon, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 There's a night's watchman here begging a word.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Says it's urgent.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Your name, friend? - Yoren, if it please.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - This must be your son.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He has the look.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I'm a girl! Did Benjen send you? No one sent me, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm here to find men for the Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Thank you, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But that's not why I disturb you now.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black - makes him as much my brother as yours.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 There are others riding too.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The whole city will know by tomorrow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Know what? Best said in private, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Go on.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We'll talk more later.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Jory, take her safely to her room.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Come along, my lady.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You heard your father.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - How many guards does my father have? - Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you? No fear on that count, little lady.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Well? - It's about your wife, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 She's taken the Imp.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're far from home, Lady Stark.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - To whom do I speak? - Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit? - There was no time to send word.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 May I ask, my lady, why he is with you? That's why there was no time.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - He is my prisoner.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - He doesn't look like a prisoner.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 My sister will decide what he looks like.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Yes, my lady.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 She will at that.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The Eyrie.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They say it's impregnable.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Give me ten good men and some climbing spikes, I'll impregnate the bitch.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I like you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A meeting has been called.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I need to see the king first - alone.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The king is at the small council meeting, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He has summoned you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Is it about my wife? - No, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - The whore is pregnant.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You're speaking of murdering a child.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I warned you this would happen, back in the North.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Well, hear it now.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I want 'em dead, mother and child both.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And that fool Viserys as well.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Honor?! I've got seven kingdoms to rule! One king, seven kingdoms.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? - It's fear - fear and blood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Then we're no better than the Mad King.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Careful, Ned.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Careful now.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You want to assassinate a girl because the spider heard a rumor? No rumor, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The princess is with child.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Based on whose information? - Ser Jorah Mormont.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact? Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We commit murder on the word of this man? And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army - - what then? - The Narrow Sea still lies between us.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores? You're my council.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I understand your misgivings, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Truly, I do.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, - the realm will bleed.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live? We should have had them both killed years ago.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Cut her throat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Be done with it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But I will not follow you now.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 She dies.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I will have no part in it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And good luck to him.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I thought you were a better man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Out.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Out, damn you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm done with you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Go, run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war! I'll go ahead with my daughters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Get them ready.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Do it yourself.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Don't ask anyone for help.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Right away, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Lord Baelish is here for you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The word "treason" was mentioned.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - What can I do for you? - When do you return to Winterfell? - Why? What do you care? - If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If that sort of thing still interests you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I don't have the time.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It won't take more than an hour.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But as you please.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Who are your best two swords? - Heward and Wyl.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Find them and meet me at the stables.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Jon knew it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 His last words were "The seed is strong.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Look at him, the lord of all the Vale.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, - warning me - To stay away from them! Not to bring one here! Mummy - is that the bad man? - It is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He's little.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He's Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He killed your father.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He murdered the Hand of the King! Oh, did I kill him too? - I've been a very busy man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You will watch your tongue! These men are knights of the Vale.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Every one of them would die for me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You can't hurt us.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 No one can hurt us here.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Tell him, Mummy! - Tell him! - Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He's just trying to frighten us.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Lannisters are all liars.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 No one will hurt my baby.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Mummy I want to see the bad man fly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Perhaps you will, my little love.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - This man is my prisoner.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I will not have him harmed.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Take him down below so he can rest.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Introduce him to Mord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You go sleep, dwarf man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Sleep good, little dwarf man! Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - He adores the man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You're jealous.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Are you sure this won't hurt? - Only if I slip.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - And you'd prefer me like this? - Mm-hm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I want you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours? Hold still.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 His eye was dangling out of the damn socket! He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Easy for you to say.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It's not a gift.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 No one gave it to me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm good because I work at it - every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I could work at fighting all day, every day, I'd still never be as good as you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Everywhere? - Everywhere.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 So how did it end up? - The Targaryen girl will die? - It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Robert's rather tasteless about it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You have to give it to the Lannisters - they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I have an outrageous amount of money.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Not as much as the Lannisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But a lot more than you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Last time we were out there for two weeks.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day, all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Oh.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But Robert loves his killing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - And he's the king.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Hmm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - How did that ever happen? - Because he loves his killing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And he used to be good at it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Do you know who should be king? - Be serious.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I am.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 My father could be your bank.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I've never fought in a war before, - but I'd fight for you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I'm fourth in line.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And where's Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Tommen is eight.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - Stannis? - Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He's still my older brother.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - What are you doing?! - Look at it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - You cut me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - It's just blood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We've all got it in us.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Sometimes a little spills.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If you become king, you're going to see a lot of this.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You need to get used to it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Go on.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Look.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 People love you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They love to serve you because you're kind to them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They want to be near you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You don't love killing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared? You would be a wonderful king.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 You seemed so good together.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 No.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He's not serious enough.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Hmm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Was it really worth it? Losing him this way? I don't know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 But I do know this - if the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea we won't be able to stop them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The Dothraki don't sail.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Every child knows that.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They don't have discipline.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They don't have armor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - They don't have siege weapons.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - It's a neat little trick you do - you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Is my father wrong? Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 We hole up in our castles.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 A wise move - only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They leave us in our castles.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee king, their cowardly king hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all? We still outnumber them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Which is the bigger number - five or one? Five.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Five One.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 One army - a real army united behind one leader with one purpose.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Our purpose died with the Mad King.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And everybody wants something different.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Your father wants to own the world.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What do you want? We haven't had a real fight in nine years.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Backstabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And that's all the realm is now - backstabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Our marriage.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Ah, so here we sit, holding it all together.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Don't you get tired? Every day.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 How long can hate hold a thing together? Well, 17 years is quite a long time.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Yes, it is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What was she like? You've never asked about her, not once.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Why not? At first, just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 So why now? What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over? You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Someone took her away from me, and seven kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I felt something for you once, you know? I know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Even after we lost our first boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 For quite a while, actually.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment? No.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Does that make you feel better or worse? It doesn't make me feel anything.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 She looks like him, don't she, my lord? She has his nose, his black hair.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Aye.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Tell him when you see him, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - I will.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - And tell him I've been with no one else.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I swear it, my lord, by the old gods and new.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The king was always good to me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 When Jon Arryn came to visit you, - what did he want? - He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Looks healthy enough to me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 The girl shall want for nothing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Brothels make a much better investment than ships, I've found.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Whores rarely sink.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 What do you know of King Robert's bastards? Well, he has more than you, for a start.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 - How many? - Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 And Jon Arryn tracked them all down.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Why? He was the King's Hand.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	 He was overcome with fatherly love.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Your pardon, Your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I would rise, but Do you know what your wife has done? - She did nothing I did not command.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Who'd have thought she had it in her? By what right dare you lay hands on my blood? - I am the King's Hand - You were the King's Hand! You shall now be held accountable.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He butchered my men.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Quiet, woman.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Jaime has fled the city.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I took you for a king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Hold your tongue.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I should wear the armor and you the gown.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 See what she does to me? My loving wife.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I should not have hit her.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 That was not That was not kingly.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 If we don't act there will be a war.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 She's had her fun, now put an end to it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime? I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I don't want to know.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 This is what matters - I can't rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 As you command, Your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 With your leave I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Piss on that.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Send a raven.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I want you to stay.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm the king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I get what I want.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I never loved my brothers.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You were the brother I chose.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 We'll talk when I return from the hunt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The hunt? Killing things clears my head.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You'll hate it more than I do.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - The Targaryen girl - Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Put on the badge.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Khaleesi? Oh, Khaleesi! You're hurt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Not too fast.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Come on, Dancer.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When are you gonna tell him? Not now.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Blood for blood.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Come on! You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - You're talking about war.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - I'm talking about justice.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him You want me to march on Casterly Rock? - You're not a boy anymore.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Come on.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They attacked your father.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They've already started the war.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Where's Bran? I don't know.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It's not my House.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Robb? All alone in the deep, dark woods.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm not alone.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My brother is with me.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I don't see him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Got him hidden under your cloak? Ooh, that's a pretty pin.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Silver.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 We'll take the pin and the horse.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Get down.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Be quick about it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I can't.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The saddle The straps.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple? I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed! Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The boy's worth nothing dead.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Benjen Stark's own blood? Think what Mance would give us.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 We're going as far south as south goes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Drop the knife! Let him go and I'll let you live.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Robb.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Robb.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Shut up.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Drop the blade! - No, don't.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Do it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Are you all right? Yes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It doesn't hurt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Tough little lad.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Well done.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed? He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - You don't have the right - To save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 What about her? Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 We'll keep her alive.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord! Dwarf man making noise! How would you like to be rich? Dwarf man still making noise.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My family is rich.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 We have gold, lots of gold.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in No gold! Well, I don't have it here.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 No gold! Fuck off.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I don't want to practice today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 No? They killed Jory.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My father is hurt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You are troubled.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Yes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I don't like dolls and k You're not here.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You're with your trouble.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 If you are with your trouble when fighting happens more trouble for you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Just so.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 How can you be quick as a snake or as quiet as a shadow when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Do you pray to the gods? - The old and the new.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 There is only one god and his name is death.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And there is only one thing we say to death - "Not today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" She has to eat the whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 She's doing well.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 She'll never keep it down.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Tell me what she's saying.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 "The prince is riding.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 "I have heard the thunder of his hooves.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 "Swift as the wind he rides.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 "His enemies will cower before him "and their wives will weep tears of blood.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" She's going to have a boy.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He won't be a real Targaryen.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He won't be a true dragon.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 "The stallion who mounts the world.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" The stallion is the khal of khals.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He shall unite the people into a single khalasar.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 All the people of the world will be his herd.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego They love her.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego She truly is a queen today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You know the law.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It's not my law.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They don't belong to you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Whatever is hers is also mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Once, perhaps.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Two eggs - a ship and an army.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - And you have all three.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - I need a large army.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old, and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Never.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Not a piece of it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth or fear or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You can have her.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 But let me go.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You can go.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You can't have the eggs.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You swore an oath to me.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Does loyalty mean nothing to you? It means everything to me.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And yet here you stand.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And yet here I stand.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Mord! Mord! Noise again! - About the gold - No gold! - No gold.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Listen to me! Listen to me.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Sometimes possession is an abstract concept When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Where? Where? I don't know where, but when they free me You want free? Go be free.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Have you ever heard the phrase "Rich as a Lannister"? Of course you have! You're a smart man.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You know who the Lannisters are.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I am a Lannister.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, "a Lannister always pays his debts.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I will owe you gold.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 What message? Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You wish to confess your crimes? Yes, my lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I do, my lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The sky cells always break them.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Speak, Imp.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Meet your gods as an honest man.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My crimes and sins are beyond counting.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I have lied and cheated gambled and whored.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You want specifics, I suppose.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I stole her robe.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When I was 10, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When I was 12 I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I flogged the one-eyed snake.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I skinned my sausage.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 At least I hope she did.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel Silence! What happened next? What do you think you're doing? Confessing my crimes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband - Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Oh, I'm very sorry.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I don't know anything about all that.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You've had your little joke.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I trust you enjoyed it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Mord, take him back to the dungeon.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 But this time find a smaller cell with a steeper floor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Is this how justice is done in the Vale? You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the king's justice? I am accused and demand a trial! If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I understand the law.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 We have no executioner in the Eyrie.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Life is more elegant here.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Open the Moon Door.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Very well.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Then you will leave by one door or the other.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 No need to bother Lord Robin.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I demand a trial by combat.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You have that right.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My lady, I beg the honor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Let me be your champion.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The honor should be mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - I'll fight for you, my lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - It'll be my honor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - The honor should be mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Make the bad man fly! Ser Vardis you're quiet.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Don't you want to avenge my husband? With all my heart, my lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 But the Imp is half my size.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Agreed.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You demanded a trial by combat.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Now I demand a champion.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I have that right, same as you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My lady, I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I wouldn't be too glad, ser.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Send a raven for him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm happy to wait.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The trial will be today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Do I have a volunteer? Anyone? Anyone? I think we can assume that no one is willing I'll stand for the dwarf.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 More wine, Your Grace? - What was I saying? - Simpler time.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It was! It was.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You're too young to remember.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Wasn't it simpler, Selmy? - It was, Your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Nothing like today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - It sounds exhilarating.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Exhilarating, yes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You ever fuck a Riverlands girl? Once.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I think.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You think? I think you'd remember.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - We used to call it "making the eight.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" - Those were some lucky girls.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You ever make the eight, Barristan? I don't believe so, Your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Those were the days.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Which days, exactly? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground? Easy, boy.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I suppose it was all rather heroic.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 More wine, Your Grace? They burned most everything in the Riverlands - our fields, our granaries, our homes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They took our women, then they took 'em again.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Brigands, most likely.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They weren't thieves.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They didn't steal nothing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 They even left something behind, Your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The king is hunting.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Fish.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The sigil of House Tully.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand? These men, were they flying a sigil? - A banner? - None, your Hand.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The one who was leading them Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 That sounds like someone we know.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The Mountain.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm sure you have as well.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife? If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, - it would be - That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Well I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Lord Beric Dondarrion.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You shall have the command.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 As you command.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I denounce him and attaint him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings and sentence him to death.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My lord This This is a drastic action.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Grand Maester Pycelle.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - My lord.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Send a raven to Casterly Rock.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the Crown and a traitor to the realm.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 A bold move, my lord, and admirable.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister? Fight! Hold! - Attack! Attack! - Come on, Ser Vardis! Attack! Stand and fight, coward! Yes! Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 What are you doing? Get up! Get up, get up, get up! Raise your sword.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Raise it! Get up, man! - On your feet! - Get up! Get up and fight, Ser Vardis! No! Have mercy! Is it over? You don't fight with honor! No.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He did.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Can I make the little man fly now? Not this little man.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 This little man is going home.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I believe you have something of mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 A Lannister always pays his debts.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It's important to remember where you come from.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My mother isn't from the North.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm aware of that.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there? Yes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I have hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I've never seen it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Would you like to? No.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Where are you from anyway? The North or the South? - I come from a very small village in - Oh, wait.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I just realized I don't care.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Sansa - Septa.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Now you are being rude.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My prince.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My prince.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 My lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 With your permission? It's beautiful, like the one your mother wears.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You'll be queen someday.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 It's only fitting you should look the part.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Will you forgive me for my rudeness? There's nothing to forgive.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You're my lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 One day we'll be married in the throne room.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the salt shore in the South.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And you will be queen over all of them.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'll never disrespect you again.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'll never be cruel to you again.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Do you understand me? You're my lady now from this day until my last day.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Stop.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Stop! - Whoa.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - What are you doing? - Going to King's Landing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 In a turnip cart? I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And you can afford that? Some of my friends are more generous than others.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 So I'll have lots of company.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands? Don't be a fool.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 There's nothing left for me here.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Let's go, Steffon.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Giddy up.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Let me see it one more time! See what? I'm going to miss you! I know.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - What? - Listen - What about Joffrey? - Are you dying because of your leg? - Is that why you're sending us home? - What? No.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Please, Father.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Please don't.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - You can't.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I've got my lessons with Syrio.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm finally getting good.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 This isn't a punishment.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Can we take Syrio back with us? Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I love him and I'm meant to be his queen - and have his babies.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Seven hells.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The lion's not his sigil, idiot.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He's a stag, like his father.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He is not.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 He's nothing like that old drunk king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Go on, girls.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Get your septa and start packing your things.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Wait! - Come on.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 But it's not fair! "Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" "Axel Baratheon, black of hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" "Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" "Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" "Robert Baratheon, black of hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" "Joffrey Baratheon "golden-haired.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	" Daenerys! Where's my sister? Stop him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Where is she? Hmm? Where is she? I'm here for the feast.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 The whore's feast? - Come.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 - Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon! Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 Back there.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 That is no place for a king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	 You are no king.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	"Summoned to court to answer for the crimes "of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	" Er "Arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	" Poor Ned Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Brave man, terrible judgment.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Attacking him was stupid.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Lannisters don't act like fools.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Are you going to say something clever? Go on, say something clever.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Catelyn Stark took my brother.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Why is he still alive? - Tyrion? Ned Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why is he still alive? It wouldn't have been clean.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Clean.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That's what you want people to think of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's the truth.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 When you hear them whispering "kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you? Of course it bothers me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'm giving you half of our forces - You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He's a Lannister.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of No, that's not an opinion.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's a fact.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 If another house can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Your mother's dead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Before long I'll be dead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's the family name that lives on.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's all that lives on.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you understand? Hmm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And you're still blessed with youth.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And what have you done with these blessings, huh? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings - one a madman, the other a drunk.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not next year.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not tomorrow.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're in pain.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I've had worse, my lady.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Perhaps it's time to go home.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles? Has he done this before? Jaime would have killed him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Your brother or your lover? The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We shared a womb.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We came into this world together.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We belong together.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My son saw you with him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you love your children? - With all my heart.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - No more than I love mine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - And they're all Jaime's.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Thank the gods.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - In the morning, he doesn't remember.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - You've always hated him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Hated him? I worshipped him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine, and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	" Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 When the king returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You must be gone by then - you and your children.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I will not have their blood on my hands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Such a sad mistake.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I've made many mistakes in my life but that wasn't one of them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Oh, but it was.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 There is no middle ground.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Come here.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh! Oh, yes! Oh! Oh! Oh, yes, yes, yes.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Oh! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh! No, no, no, no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you - wherever you're from - do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying? Yes, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Well, go ahead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Slowly.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're not fooling them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 They just paid you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 They know what you are.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 They know it's all just an act.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Your job is to make them forget what they know.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Now, that takes time.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You need to ease into it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Go ahead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Ease into it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He's winning you over in spite of yourself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're starting to like this.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He wants to believe you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why shouldn't you? He knows he's better than other men.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He's always known it deep down inside.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Now he has proof.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why don't you join us, my lord? I'm saving myself for another.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 A stupid saying.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 She must be very beautiful.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 No, not really.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Impeccable bloodlines though.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I do believe my lord's in love.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 For many years.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Most of my life, really.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Play with her arse.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And she loved me too.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I was her little confidant, her plaything.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 She could tell me anything, anything at all.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle that she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry - a Northerner with a jaw like an anvil.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 So I challenged him to a duel.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 "He's just a boy," she said.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 "Please don't hurt him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	" So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Is she still married to him? Oh, no.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He got himself killed before the wedding and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 She loves him, I'm afraid.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? He's just so good.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that I'll never win, not that way.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That's their game, their rules.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'm not going to fight them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'm going to fuck them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That's what I know.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That's what I am.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And what do you want? Oh, everything, my dear.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Everything there is.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Now wash yourselves.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Both of you are working tonight.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Hmm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're a very lucky girl.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you know that? Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The sea would come in closer and closer.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You'd see death creeping towards you a few inches at a time.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Where is it you come from? The Iron Islands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 They far away? You've never heard of the Iron Islands? Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 "Trust me, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	" You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - And what's that? - Lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why? What do you mean, why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too? - I will be lord after my father.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - So you're not lord now? No, you Are you having a go at me? Is that it? I just don't understand how you southerners do things.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - I'm not a southerner.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - You're from south of the Wall.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That makes you a southerner to me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're an impudent little wench, aren't you? Couldn't say, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Don't know what "impunent" means.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Impudent.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It means rude, disrespectful.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you want to lose that chain? Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I thought she was our prisoner.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience? Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'm used to worse than him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Hmm? I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why did you come here? Didn't mean to come here.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Meant to get much further south than this.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 As far south as south goes, before the long night comes.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why? What are you afraid of? There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Owls and shadowcats - I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The things you speak of - they've been gone for thousands of years.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 They wasn't gone, old man.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 They was sleeping.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And they ain't sleeping no more.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I miss girls.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not even talking to them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I never talked to them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Just looking at them, hearing them giggle.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Don't you miss girls? Riders.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The horn.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We have to blow the horn.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why is he alone? One blast for a ranger returning, two for wildlings, - three for - There's no rider.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Whoa, boy, whoa.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Where's my uncle? Ned! It's Robert.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We were hunting a boar I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I was never meant to be a father.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Go on.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You don't want to see this.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My fault.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Too much wine, missed my thrust.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It stinks.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It stinks like death.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Don't think I can't smell it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I paid the bastard back, Ned.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I drove my knife right through his brain.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You ask 'em if I didn't.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Ask 'em! I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Now leave us, the lot of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I need to talk to Ned.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Robert, my sweet - Out, all of you! You damned fool.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Paper and ink on the table.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Write down what I say.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 "In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, "first of" You know how it goes.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Fill in the damn titles.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 "I hereby command "Eddard of House Stark" titles, titles "to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm "upon my death, "to rule in my stead "until my son Joffrey comes of age.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	" Give it over.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Give it to the council after I'm dead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You'll rule now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The girl Daenerys.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You were right.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Varys, Littlefinger, my brother worthless.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 No one to tell me "no" but you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Only you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Let her live.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Stop it, if it's not too late.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I will.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And my son help him, Ned.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Make him better than me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'll I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My memory.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Give me something for the pain and let me die.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Give him milk of the poppy.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He was reeling from the wine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He commanded us to step aside, but I failed him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 No man could have protected him from himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine? His squire, from the king's own skin.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 His squire? The Lannister boy? Such a dutiful boy to make sure His Grace did not lack refreshment.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Whatever arrangements you made unmake them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 At once.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'm afraid those birds have flown.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The girl is likely dead already.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 According to the prophecy the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The earth ends at the black salt sea.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 No horse can cross the poison water.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The earth does not end at the sea there are many dirts beyond the sea.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The dirt where I was born.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not dirts.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Lands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Lands, yes There are thousands of ships in the free cities.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Wooden horses that fly across the sea Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's not a chair.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's a  throne.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Throne.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 A King does not need a chair to sit upon.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He only needs a horse.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Can't you help me make him understand? The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Have patience, Khaleesi.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We will go home, I promise you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Have I said something funny, ser? Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the Kingdoms because they were his right.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He had no right to them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He seized them because he could.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And because he had dragons.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Ah, well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - You don't believe it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 As for the rest it was 300 years ago.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Who knows what really happened? Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant captain, see if he has any letters for me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - I'll come with you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - No, no, don't trouble yourself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Enjoy the market.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'll rejoin you soon enough.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Psst! Jorah the Andal.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The Spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 A royal pardon.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You can go home now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Sweet reds I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor! Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours! I have them! I have them! A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 One taste and you'll name your first child after me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Just a taste.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My lady, you are from Westeros.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Khaleesi of the Riding Men and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Princess.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Rise.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'd still like to taste that wine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That? Dornish swill.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not worthy of a princess.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I have a dry red from the Arbor - nectar of the gods.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Let me give you a cask.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 A A gift.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You honor me, ser.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The honor the honor is all mine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You know, there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, Princess.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I hope to repay your kindness someday.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Rakharo.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Put down that cask.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Is something wrong? - I have a thirst.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Open it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The wine is for the khaleesi.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's not for the likes of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Open it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Pour.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich - without at least giving it time to breathe.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Do as he says.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 As the princess commands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, ser? Taste it, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You first.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You will drink.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Stop him! Come.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You came to us as outlaws poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You came alone, in chains, without friends or honor.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You came to us rich and you came to us poor.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Some of you bear the names of proud Houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It does not matter.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 All that is in the past.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Here on the Wall we are all one House.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Tonight - You're allowed to look happy.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You're going to be a ranger.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Isn't that what you always wanted? I want to find my uncle.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I know he's alive out there.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I know he is.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I wish I could help you, but I'm no ranger.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It's the steward's life for me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 There's honor in being a steward.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not much, really.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 But there's food.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Here you begin anew.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 A man of the Night's Watch lives his life for the realm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not for a king or a lord, or the honor of this House or that House, not for gold or glory, or a woman's love, but for the realm and all the people in it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You've all learned the words of the vow.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Think carefully before you say them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The penalty for desertion is death.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You can take your vows here tonight at sunset.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do any of you still keep the old gods? I do, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Yes, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You'll find a weirwood a mile north of the Wall.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And your old gods too, maybe.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My lord, might I go as well? Does House Tarly keep the old gods? No, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House? The Night's Watch is my House now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The Seven have never answered my prayers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Perhaps the old gods will.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 As you wish, lad.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Halder to the builders.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Pyp to the stewards.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Toad to the builders.

s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Allo to the builders.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Nelugo to the rangers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 May all the gods preserve you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Rangers with me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Builders! Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe in the stables.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Make no comment about his nose.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath? Certainly.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you take me for a servant? We took you for a man of the Night's Watch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 But perhaps we were wrong in that.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - May I go? - As you wish.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing? I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He wanted it and he got it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Stewards are nothing but maids! I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you! - It's not fair.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 - Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 So now I'm here - at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'll never see my family again.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I'll never be inside a woman again.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 So don't tell me about fair.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock? Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Now listen to me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The old man is the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You'll be with him day and night.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Yes, you'll clean his clothes.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You'll know everything, be part of everything.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And he asked for you himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He wants to groom you for command.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I just I always wanted to be a ranger.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I always wanted to be a wizard.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 What? No, I'm serious.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 So you'll stay and say your words with me? Lord Stark a moment.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Alone, if you will.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He named you Protector of the Realm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He did.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 She won't care.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 And what should I do with a hundred swords? Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 What about Stannis? Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Stannis is your older brother.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 It shouldn't matter now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He inspires no love or loyalty.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He's not a king.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 I am.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Stannis is a commander.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He's led men into war twice.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Yes, he's a good soldier.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Everyone knows that.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 So was Robert.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Tell me something.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings? I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Not his steward not his captain of the guard and not his wife.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Only Stannis himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Yes, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Now leave us.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 My Lord Protector.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 The king has no trueborn sons.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	 Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Yah! Left high, left low.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Right low, lunge right.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You break anything, the septa will have my head.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 What is Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - How she could forget - She didn't forget.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She's with her dancing master.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She's with him every morning.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She's so clumsy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Hush! Go back to your room.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - What is it? What's happening? - Do as I told you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Run! This way! Left, right.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Rah! - Now you are dead.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - You said right, but you went left.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - And now you are a dead girl.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Only 'cause you lied.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 My tongue lied.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 My eyes shouted the truth.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - You were not seeing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - I was so.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I watched, but you Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Arya Stark, come with us.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Your father wants to see you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? - I am wondering.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Mind your place, dancing master.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - This is no concern of yours.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - My father wouldn't send you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Take her.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child? Get out of my way, little man.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I am Syrio Forel Foreign bastard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Kill the Braavosi.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Bring the girl.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Run to your father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Bloody oafs.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Begone now, Arya.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Come with me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Run.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The first sword of Braavos does not run.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 What do we say to the god of death? Not today.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Go.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Not today.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Not today.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Stay away from me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'll tell my father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'll I'll tell the queen.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Who do you think sent me? Needle.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 There she is.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - What do you want? - I want you, wolf girl.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Come here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Leave me be.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - My father's a lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 He'll reward you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - She'll reward me - the queen! Stay away! Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Varys.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I promise you it isn't poisoned.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, my lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I would save the rest, if I were you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Hide it.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 What about my daughters? The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Even my little birds cannot find her.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - And Sansa? - Still engaged to Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Cersei will keep her close.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The rest of your household though all dead, it grieves me to say.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I do so hate the sight of blood.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And would again, my lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth? The madness of mercy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - That she might save her children.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Ah, the children.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 It's always the innocents who suffer.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard? The queen can't kill me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Cat holds her brother.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The wrong brother, sadly.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And lost to her.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Not today, my lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Tell me something, Varys.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Who do you truly serve? The realm, my lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Someone must.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 It's Othor, without a doubt.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party? Just these two, my lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Been dead awhile, I'd say.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Mmm.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - The smell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 What smell? There is none.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot? - We should burn them.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Snow's not wrong, my lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Fire will do for them.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The wildling way.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Get them inside.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - You heard him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers A raven from King's Landing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Come on, move 'em out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The king is dead.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Is there any word of my father? Sit.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Your duty lies here now.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 My sisters were in King's Landing too.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 He wouldn't do that.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 He knows how much I love Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 He wouldn't.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Send for my father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 We know that.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 How can I allow you to marry my son? A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch? No, I'm not.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I won't hatch anything.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, - what's his name? - Robb.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Best it comes from you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If If I could see my father, talk to him about You disappoint me, child.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 We have told you of your father's treason.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Why would you want to speak to a traitor? I only meant that What will happen to him? - That depends.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - On - On what? - On your brother.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And on you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Treason? Sansa wrote this? It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed? This is a royal command, my lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - If you should refuse to obey - I won't refuse.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 But not alone.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Call the banners.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 All of them, my lord? They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not? They have.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Now we see what their words are worth.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Yes.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Are you afraid? I must be.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Good.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Why is that good? - It means you're not stupid.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You've had this since dawn? He sent it to me, not you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - My son intends to declare war.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - A war? Your son against the Lannisters? You should go to him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Teach him patience.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law! Does family mean nothing to you? Family means everything to me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - I'm hungry.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Hush now, darling.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You just ate.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You will not support us, then? Do I understand you correctly? - But I'm hungry! - Soon, love, soon.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You're always welcome here, sister.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight That is what I ask.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Go on, sweet.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Time for your bath.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'll feed you after.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If you fear for the safety of your son Of course I fear for the safety of my son! Are you an idiot? They killed my husband.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You say they shoved your boy from a window.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - These people will do anything.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - And that is why we have to stop them.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I should just take your food and leave you here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Eh? - What would you do then? - Starve, most likely.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You don't think I'd do it, do you? What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women? Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 But you knew that.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Fair enough.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price, I'll beat it.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I like living.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Tyrion.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Tyrion.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Come, share our fire.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Help yourselves to our goat.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 When you meet your gods, you tell them Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin? In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Take the halfman.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 He can dance for the children.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Kill the other one.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 No, no, no, no, no! My My house is rich and powerful.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 We have no use for a halfman's promises.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by? Are those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Lannister smiths shit better steel.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You think you can win us over with your trinkets? That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I will give you this.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 What is "this"? The Vale of Arryn.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The lords of the Vale want me dead.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Now there's a rare sight Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Jon, no! - Jon, stop, put it down! Blood will always tell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You'll hang for this, bastard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I told you not to do anything stupid.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You're confined to quarters.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Go.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Ghost, what's wrong? Is someone out there? Commander? Stay.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Hello? Who's there? Lord Commander? Snow? Commander! Move! What did they do? Lamb men make good slaves.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Jorah, make them stop.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Khaleesi? - You heard me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 These men have shed blood for their khal.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Now they claim their rewards.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The riders do her honor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Come.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - What do you want done with them? - Bring her to me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And those women there.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You cannot claim them all, Princess.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I can, and I will.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Moon of my life, Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Tell me the truth of this.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 This is the way of war.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 It pleases me to keep them safe.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Does the horse mate with the lamb? The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You are a foreigner.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You do not command me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I am Khaleesi.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I do command you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 See how fierce she grows? That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I will hear no more.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I will not have your body burned.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I will not give you that honor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The beetles will feed on your eyes.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The worms will crawl through your lungs.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 First you have to kill me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I already have.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 My sun and stars is wounded.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 A scratch moon of my life.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Where are the healers? This is the bite of a fly.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I can help the great rider with his cut.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She is mine.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Let her speak.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Thank you, silver lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Who are you? I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I was the godswife of this temple.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Witch.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 My mother was godswife here before me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his Too many words.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 A witch's words poison the ears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Galbart Glover will lead the van.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Oathbreaker, is it?! I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Your meat is bloody tough.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - What is it? What's happened? - Shh, it's all right.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Where are you going? - South.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 For Father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - But it's the middle of the night.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I don't want them to know we're coming.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - They have more men than we do.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Aye, they do.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Can't I come with you? I can ride now.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You've seen me riding.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And I won't get in the way, I There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Until I return that will be you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Do you understand? Listen to Maester Luwin.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Look after your little brother.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - I will.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Until I return.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 How long have you been hiding out there? Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - They've all gone away.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - They'll be back soon.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 No, they won't.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Please watch over Robb.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And Theon too, I suppose.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You hear them, boy? The old gods are answering you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - What are you doing here? - They're my gods too.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Even slaves are allowed to pray.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - You're not a slave.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 What did you mean about hearing the gods? You asked them, they're answering you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Shh.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Open your ears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 It's only the wind.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods? They see you, boy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 They hear you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The old gods have no power in the South.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 How can they watch when they have no eyes? Well, there's a big man.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Go dress.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Hodor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Are there really giants beyond the wall? Giants and worse than giants.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 North, not south! The cold winds are rising.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 They were touched by white walkers.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 That's why they came back.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 That's why their eyes turned blue.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Only fire will stop them.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - How do you know that? - I read about it in a book a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - What else did the book say? - The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And when they wake up And when they wake up, what? I hope the Wall's high enough.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Summer snows, my lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Robb's brought the North with him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Mother! You look well.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I had not thought to be here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I would speak with my son alone.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 I know you will forgive me, my lords.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You heard her! Move your arses! Come on, out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You too, Greyjoy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 Are you bloody deaf? Have no fear, my lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - You old devil, Rodrik.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - Jon.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 You're not wasting away, are you? I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 And now I find you leading a host to war.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - There was no one else.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - No one? Who were those men I saw here? - None of them are Starks.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - All of them are seasoned in battle.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 If you think you can send me back to Winterfell Oh, would that I could.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 There was a letter.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 From Sansa.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 From the queen, you mean.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - There's no mention of Arya.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 - No.
s01e08	The Pointy End	 How many men do you have?
s01e09	Baelor	You've seen better days, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	 Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
s01e09	Baelor	 No, no, many still love you.
s01e09	Baelor	 Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
s01e09	Baelor	 On her knees begging for me.
s01e09	Baelor	 Hm! Did you laugh with the others? You do me wrong, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your blood is the last thing l want.
s01e09	Baelor	 l don't know what you want.
s01e09	Baelor	 l've given up trying to guess.
s01e09	Baelor	 When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities.
s01e09	Baelor	 They taught me that each man has a role to play.
s01e09	Baelor	 The same is true at court.
s01e09	Baelor	 l am the master of whisperers.
s01e09	Baelor	 My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'm a good actor, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	 Huh.
s01e09	Baelor	 Can you free me from this pit? l could.
s01e09	Baelor	 But will l? No.
s01e09	Baelor	 As l said, l'm no hero.
s01e09	Baelor	 What do you want? Tell me.
s01e09	Baelor	 No riddles, no stories Tell me, what do you want? Peace.
s01e09	Baelor	 Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.
s01e09	Baelor	 Fighting for his father's freedom.
s01e09	Baelor	 Robb? He's just a boy.
s01e09	Baelor	 Boys have been conquerors before.
s01e09	Baelor	 But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother.
s01e09	Baelor	 Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.
s01e09	Baelor	 He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
s01e09	Baelor	 Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
s01e09	Baelor	 The throne is his by rights.
s01e09	Baelor	 Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt would be a shame to throw it away.
s01e09	Baelor	 Cersei is no fool.
s01e09	Baelor	 She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
s01e09	Baelor	 You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son? l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.
s01e09	Baelor	 Cersei knows you as a man of honor.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
s01e09	Baelor	 You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of Of what? You grew up with actors.
s01e09	Baelor	 You learned their craft and you learnt it well.
s01e09	Baelor	 But l grew up with soldiers.
s01e09	Baelor	 l learned how to die a long time ago.
s01e09	Baelor	 Pity.
s01e09	Baelor	 Such a pity.
s01e09	Baelor	 What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you? lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Keep shooting them down.
s01e09	Baelor	 We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
s01e09	Baelor	 He's Grandfather's bannerman.
s01e09	Baelor	 We can't expect his support? Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised.
s01e09	Baelor	 Look.
s01e09	Baelor	 Father rots in a dungeon.
s01e09	Baelor	 How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
s01e09	Baelor	 Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing.
s01e09	Baelor	 We've got five times his numbers.
s01e09	Baelor	 You can take the Twins if you have to.
s01e09	Baelor	 Not in time.
s01e09	Baelor	 Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
s01e09	Baelor	 The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
s01e09	Baelor	 Have my horse saddled and ready.
s01e09	Baelor	 Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
s01e09	Baelor	 Or throw you in a dungeon.
s01e09	Baelor	 Or slit your throat.
s01e09	Baelor	 My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing.
s01e09	Baelor	 Whatever it took.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
s01e09	Baelor	 l agree.
s01e09	Baelor	 - l'll go.
s01e09	Baelor	 - You can't! l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl.
s01e09	Baelor	 He would never harm me.
s01e09	Baelor	 Unless there was a profit in it.
s01e09	Baelor	 What do you want? lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, spare me.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your boy's too proud to come before me himself.
s01e09	Baelor	 What am l supposed to do with you? Father, you forget yourself.
s01e09	Baelor	 Lady Stark is here Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die.
s01e09	Baelor	 Do l look dead to you? - Father, please - l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.
s01e09	Baelor	 All right, you come forward.
s01e09	Baelor	 There.
s01e09	Baelor	 Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.
s01e09	Baelor	 ls there somewhere we can talk? We're talking right now.
s01e09	Baelor	 Fine.
s01e09	Baelor	 Out! All of you! - Oh! - You too.
s01e09	Baelor	 You see that? Fifteen, she is.
s01e09	Baelor	 A little flower.
s01e09	Baelor	 And her honey's all mine.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'm sure she will give you many sons.
s01e09	Baelor	 Huh.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your father didn't come to the wedding.
s01e09	Baelor	 He is quite ill, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	 Huh.
s01e09	Baelor	 Didn't come to the last one, either.
s01e09	Baelor	 Or the one before that.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your family has always pissed on me.
s01e09	Baelor	 - My lord, l - Don't deny it.
s01e09	Baelor	 You know it's true.
s01e09	Baelor	 The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
s01e09	Baelor	 - l'm sure there were reasons - l didn't need reasons.
s01e09	Baelor	 l needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
s01e09	Baelor	 You see how they pile up? Why are you here? To ask you to open your gates, my lord so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Why should l let him? - lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here.
s01e09	Baelor	 Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
s01e09	Baelor	 You swore an oath to my father.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, yes, l said some words.
s01e09	Baelor	 And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right.
s01e09	Baelor	 Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Why don't you? - Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.
s01e09	Baelor	 Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you? Andengage! When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand? - Soon, he says.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Good.
s01e09	Baelor	 You'll be ready for this, then.
s01e09	Baelor	 l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt's called Longclaw.
s01e09	Baelor	 Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.
s01e09	Baelor	 This is Valyrian steel.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt was my father's sword, his father before him.
s01e09	Baelor	 The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt was meant for my son Jorah.
s01e09	Baelor	 He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
s01e09	Baelor	 - My lord, you honor me, but l can't - Oh, you can.
s01e09	Baelor	 And you will.
s01e09	Baelor	 l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast.
s01e09	Baelor	 A bloody dead man tried to kill me.
s01e09	Baelor	 So you'll take it.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'll hear no more about it.
s01e09	Baelor	 - ls that understood? - Yes, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	 Right.
s01e09	Baelor	 Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.
s01e09	Baelor	 That's a man's sword.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt'll take a man to wield it.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
s01e09	Baelor	 No, you won't.
s01e09	Baelor	 l sent him to King's Landing yesterday.
s01e09	Baelor	 The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist l've, uh, ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king.
s01e09	Baelor	 That should get young Joffrey's attention.
s01e09	Baelor	 And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne.
s01e09	Baelor	 Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
s01e09	Baelor	 Yes, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Well done.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Well done.
s01e09	Baelor	 You earned that, Snow.
s01e09	Baelor	 Well done.
s01e09	Baelor	 Go on, let's have a look.
s01e09	Baelor	 - At what? - The sword! Show us the sword.
s01e09	Baelor	 Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! - Let's have a look.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Piss off.
s01e09	Baelor	 Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light.
s01e09	Baelor	 Give it here! What is it? - l - Look at its eyes.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Give it.
s01e09	Baelor	 - l can't.
s01e09	Baelor	 You can't what? l l'm really not supposed to say.
s01e09	Baelor	 And yet you really want to say.
s01e09	Baelor	 You want to say that? There was a raven.
s01e09	Baelor	 l read the message to Maester Aemon.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt's your brother Robb.
s01e09	Baelor	 What? What about him? He's heading south.
s01e09	Baelor	 To war.
s01e09	Baelor	 All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
s01e09	Baelor	 They'll keep him safe.
s01e09	Baelor	 l should be there.
s01e09	Baelor	 l should be with him.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf we do that, they'll never get back across.
s01e09	Baelor	 Well? What did he say? Lord Walder has granted your crossing.
s01e09	Baelor	 - His men are yours, as well.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Huh.
s01e09	Baelor	 Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
s01e09	Baelor	 What does he want in return? You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire.
s01e09	Baelor	 - He expects a knighthood in good time.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Fine, fine.
s01e09	Baelor	 And? And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
s01e09	Baelor	 - She won't be happy about that.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Hm.
s01e09	Baelor	 And? And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters.
s01e09	Baelor	 Whichever you prefer.
s01e09	Baelor	 He has a number he thinks will besuitable.
s01e09	Baelor	 l see.
s01e09	Baelor	 Did you get a look at his daughters? l did.
s01e09	Baelor	 And? One was Do you consent? - Can l refuse? - Not if you want to cross.
s01e09	Baelor	 Then l consent.
s01e09	Baelor	 Sam said you wanted to see me? l did indeed.
s01e09	Baelor	 Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me.
s01e09	Baelor	 Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children? No.
s01e09	Baelor	 So they will not love.
s01e09	Baelor	 Love is the death of duty.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do? He He would do whatever was right.
s01e09	Baelor	 No matter what.
s01e09	Baelor	 Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.
s01e09	Baelor	 Most of us are not so strong.
s01e09	Baelor	 What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile? Sam told you.
s01e09	Baelor	 We're all human.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it.
s01e09	Baelor	 Honor comes easy then.
s01e09	Baelor	 Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy.
s01e09	Baelor	 A day when he must choose.
s01e09	Baelor	 And this is my day? ls that what you're saying? Oh, it hurts, boy.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, yes.
s01e09	Baelor	 - l know.
s01e09	Baelor	 - You do not know.
s01e09	Baelor	 No one knows.
s01e09	Baelor	 l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
s01e09	Baelor	 The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows.
s01e09	Baelor	 They waited till l was old.
s01e09	Baelor	 What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless blind, frail.
s01e09	Baelor	 But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children.
s01e09	Baelor	 Who are you? My father was Maekar, the first of his name.
s01e09	Baelor	 My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne.
s01e09	Baelor	 And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.
s01e09	Baelor	 You're Aemon Targaryen.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch.
s01e09	Baelor	 l will not tell youto stay or go.
s01e09	Baelor	 You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days.
s01e09	Baelor	 As l have.
s01e09	Baelor	 My lord My sun and stars Drogo.
s01e09	Baelor	 My horse Blood of my blood No, l must ride.
s01e09	Baelor	 He fell from his horse.
s01e09	Baelor	 A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
s01e09	Baelor	 He's tired, that's all.
s01e09	Baelor	 He needs to rest.
s01e09	Baelor	 We've ridden far enough today.
s01e09	Baelor	 We'll camp here.
s01e09	Baelor	 This is no place to camp.
s01e09	Baelor	 A woman does not give us orders.
s01e09	Baelor	 Not even a Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 We'll camp here.
s01e09	Baelor	 Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
s01e09	Baelor	 You do not command me, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 Find Mirri Maz Duur.
s01e09	Baelor	 Bring her to me.
s01e09	Baelor	 The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
s01e09	Baelor	 Hyah! Hyah! Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow.
s01e09	Baelor	 They're a day's march north.
s01e09	Baelor	 The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless - provincial courage.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Ah.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, do continue.
s01e09	Baelor	 Didn't mean to interrupt.
s01e09	Baelor	 l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
s01e09	Baelor	 The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes.
s01e09	Baelor	 Heavy black steel, double-sided.
s01e09	Baelor	 Shagga likes axes.
s01e09	Baelor	 When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
s01e09	Baelor	 - The vanguard? - Mm-hm.
s01e09	Baelor	 Me and the tribesmen on the front lines? They do seem rather ferocious.
s01e09	Baelor	 Ferocious? Last nighta Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.
s01e09	Baelor	 Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat.
s01e09	Baelor	 Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
s01e09	Baelor	 When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
s01e09	Baelor	 Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
s01e09	Baelor	 There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt appears l'm not hungry after all.
s01e09	Baelor	 Excuse me, my lords.
s01e09	Baelor	 Where did you find one so pretty at this hour? - l took her.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Took her? - From whom? - From, uh Ser What's his name? - l don't know.
s01e09	Baelor	 Ginger cunt, three tents down.
s01e09	Baelor	 - And he didn't have anything to say about it? He said something.
s01e09	Baelor	 Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically.
s01e09	Baelor	 We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, well.
s01e09	Baelor	 l, uh think l'll go and find myself one.
s01e09	Baelor	 Who are you? Who would you like me to be? What did your mother call you? Shae.
s01e09	Baelor	 What did your mother call you? My mother died giving birth to me.
s01e09	Baelor	 ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers? - What sort of accent is that? - Foreign.
s01e09	Baelor	 For What do you want from me? What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent.
s01e09	Baelor	 l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride.
s01e09	Baelor	 l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together.
s01e09	Baelor	 And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world.
s01e09	Baelor	 Which it may well be.
s01e09	Baelor	 And what do l get? One - safety.
s01e09	Baelor	 No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine.
s01e09	Baelor	 Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.
s01e09	Baelor	 Who told you this? Women you paid? And three more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years.
s01e09	Baelor	 Do you accept my proposal? Let's start with your last night in this world.
s01e09	Baelor	 Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 Come.
s01e09	Baelor	 He's very strong.
s01e09	Baelor	 No one understands how strong he is.
s01e09	Baelor	 - He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 - He can't.
s01e09	Baelor	 He can't.
s01e09	Baelor	 l won't let him.
s01e09	Baelor	 Even a queen doesn't have that power.
s01e09	Baelor	 We must go quickly.
s01e09	Baelor	 l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
s01e09	Baelor	 - l won't leave him.
s01e09	Baelor	 - He's already gone, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 Doth Even if Even if he dies why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.
s01e09	Baelor	 This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood.
s01e09	Baelor	 Here they only honor strength.
s01e09	Baelor	 There will be fighting after Drogo dies.
s01e09	Baelor	 Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.
s01e09	Baelor	 He won't want any rivals.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
s01e09	Baelor	 l won'tleave him.
s01e09	Baelor	 The wound has festered.
s01e09	Baelor	 You did this, witch.
s01e09	Baelor	 Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
s01e09	Baelor	 No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too.
s01e09	Baelor	 You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.
s01e09	Baelor	 Rein in your tongue.
s01e09	Baelor	 She is still your Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 Only while the blood of my blood lives.
s01e09	Baelor	 When he dies, she is nothing.
s01e09	Baelor	 l have never been nothing.
s01e09	Baelor	 l am the blood of the dragon.
s01e09	Baelor	 The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.
s01e09	Baelor	 l think you're right.
s01e09	Baelor	 - You've saved me once more.
s01e09	Baelor	 - And now you must save him.
s01e09	Baelor	 He's beyond the healer's skills.
s01e09	Baelor	 All l can do is ease his path.
s01e09	Baelor	 Save him and l will free you.
s01e09	Baelor	 l swear it.
s01e09	Baelor	 You must know a way.
s01e09	Baelor	 Some Some magic.
s01e09	Baelor	 There is a spell.
s01e09	Baelor	 Some would say death is cleaner.
s01e09	Baelor	 Do it.
s01e09	Baelor	 Save him.
s01e09	Baelor	 - There is a price.
s01e09	Baelor	 - You'll have gold, whatever you want.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt's not a matter of gold.
s01e09	Baelor	 This is bloodmagic.
s01e09	Baelor	 Only death pays for life.
s01e09	Baelor	 My death? No, not your death, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 Bring me his horse.
s01e09	Baelor	 Khaleesi, do not do this thing.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Let me kill this witch.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Kill her and you kill your khal.
s01e09	Baelor	 This is bloodmagic.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt is forbidden.
s01e09	Baelor	 l am your khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	 l tell you what is forbidden.
s01e09	Baelor	 Go.
s01e09	Baelor	 Now.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Take her and leave.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Uh-uh.
s01e09	Baelor	 Take her! You must go also, lady.
s01e09	Baelor	 Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent.
s01e09	Baelor	 The dead will dance here tonight.
s01e09	Baelor	 No one will enter.
s01e09	Baelor	 Bring him back to me.
s01e09	Baelor	 What have you done? l have to save him.
s01e09	Baelor	 We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.
s01e09	Baelor	 You would have been safe.
s01e09	Baelor	 This must not be.
s01e09	Baelor	 This must be.
s01e09	Baelor	 Witch.
s01e09	Baelor	 No, you can't.
s01e09	Baelor	 Khaleesi! No further, horselord.
s01e09	Baelor	 Are you hurt? - The baby - Hmm? .
s01e09	Baelor	.
s01e09	Baelor	is coming.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Fetch the midwives.
s01e09	Baelor	 - They will not come.
s01e09	Baelor	 They say she is cursed.
s01e09	Baelor	 They'll come or l'll have their heads.
s01e09	Baelor	 The witch - she can bring baby.
s01e09	Baelor	 l hear her say so.
s01e09	Baelor	 Are you in agony, my lion? - No.
s01e09	Baelor	 - You look like you're in agony.
s01e09	Baelor	 The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
s01e09	Baelor	 Ah! Damn you, woman.
s01e09	Baelor	 Are you immune to pain? - Just used to it.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	 Let's play a new game.
s01e09	Baelor	 There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
s01e09	Baelor	 Does it involve the potential for losing fingers? - Not if you win.
s01e09	Baelor	 - No! No fire games, no knife games.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Let's do something l'm good at.
s01e09	Baelor	 - What are you good at? l happen to be a great judge of character.
s01e09	Baelor	 - This sounds like a boring game.
s01e09	Baelor	 - lt's not.
s01e09	Baelor	 Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf l'm right, you drink.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf l'm wrong, l drink.
s01e09	Baelor	 And no lying.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'll know if you're lying.
s01e09	Baelor	 l don't want to play this game.
s01e09	Baelor	 Fine.
s01e09	Baelor	 Bronn first.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your father beat you.
s01e09	Baelor	 But my mother hit harder.
s01e09	Baelor	 You killed your first man before you were 12.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt was a woman.
s01e09	Baelor	 She swung an axe at me.
s01e09	Baelor	 You've been north of the Wall.
s01e09	Baelor	 What brought you up there? - Work.
s01e09	Baelor	 - And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, wait, that's me.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
s01e09	Baelor	 l don't want to play.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your mother was a whore.
s01e09	Baelor	 Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	 All right.
s01e09	Baelor	 Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
s01e09	Baelor	 Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	 - And we've established the rules about lying? - Drink! Mm.
s01e09	Baelor	 You wanted a different life.
s01e09	Baelor	 You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
s01e09	Baelor	 The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
s01e09	Baelor	 So, specifics You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you.
s01e09	Baelor	 Sowhat's a lowborn girl to do? Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Are you sure - Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.
s01e09	Baelor	 My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.
s01e09	Baelor	 My turn.
s01e09	Baelor	 Fine, fine.
s01e09	Baelor	 Ask away.
s01e09	Baelor	 Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Who were you in love with? - That's not how the game works.
s01e09	Baelor	 l don't care the way the game works.
s01e09	Baelor	 Our lord here used to be married.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Married? - How did you hear that? You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
s01e09	Baelor	 Another night, perhaps.
s01e09	Baelor	 Not another night.
s01e09	Baelor	 This night.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt's not a pleasant story.
s01e09	Baelor	 Oh, maybe l will cry.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
s01e09	Baelor	 So l was 16.
s01e09	Baelor	 My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream.
s01e09	Baelor	 She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.
s01e09	Baelor	 Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak.
s01e09	Baelor	 She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her.
s01e09	Baelor	 Her name was Tysha.
s01e09	Baelor	 She was a wheelwright's orphan.
s01e09	Baelor	 And she was hungry.
s01e09	Baelor	 Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine.
s01e09	Baelor	 lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine.
s01e09	Baelor	 l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.
s01e09	Baelor	 l forgot about everything but Tysha.
s01e09	Baelor	 And somehow l found myself in her bed.
s01e09	Baelor	 For three chickens, l should hope so.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt didn't last long.
s01e09	Baelor	 l didn't know what the hell l was doing.
s01e09	Baelor	 But she was good to me.
s01e09	Baelor	 She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song.
s01e09	Baelor	 And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.
s01e09	Baelor	 A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife.
s01e09	Baelor	 For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.
s01e09	Baelor	 Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.
s01e09	Baelor	 Not quite.
s01e09	Baelor	 First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.
s01e09	Baelor	 The girl was a whore, you see.
s01e09	Baelor	 Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapersall of it.
s01e09	Baelor	 He thought it was time l had a woman.
s01e09	Baelor	 After my brother confessed my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards.
s01e09	Baelor	 He paid her well - a silver for each man.
s01e09	Baelor	 How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.
s01e09	Baelor	 By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.
s01e09	Baelor	 l would have killed the man who did that to me.
s01e09	Baelor	 You should have known she was a whore.
s01e09	Baelor	 Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.
s01e09	Baelor	 A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
s01e09	Baelor	 As l said, l was young and stupid.
s01e09	Baelor	 You are still young and stupid.
s01e09	Baelor	 Hyah! - What is it? What do you want? - You're sleeping through the war.
s01e09	Baelor	 - What? - They stole a night's march on us.
s01e09	Baelor	 They're a mile north.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Get my squire! - You don't have a squire.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf l die, weep for me.
s01e09	Baelor	 You'll be dead.
s01e09	Baelor	 How will you know? l'll know.
s01e09	Baelor	 Watch out! Move! Out of the way! Move aside! Stay low.
s01e09	Baelor	 Stay low? lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.
s01e09	Baelor	 l was born lucky.
s01e09	Baelor	 Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! - Moon Brothers! - And Painted Dogs! - And Painted Dogs! - Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! To battle! You're a shit warrior.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'm alive? You're alive.
s01e09	Baelor	 Did we win? We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
s01e09	Baelor	 How did our tribesmen do? Yeah, good.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt's nice to see them getting along.
s01e09	Baelor	 You're wounded.
s01e09	Baelor	 Good of you to notice.
s01e09	Baelor	 l hear we won.
s01e09	Baelor	 Huh! The scouts were wrong.
s01e09	Baelor	 There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.
s01e09	Baelor	 Did we get the Stark boy, at least? He wasn't here.
s01e09	Baelor	 Where was he? With his other 18,000 men.
s01e09	Baelor	 And where are they? - We should go, my lady.
s01e09	Baelor	 - No! My lady! Hyah! Hyah! By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
s01e09	Baelor	 Lady Stark.
s01e09	Baelor	 l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.
s01e09	Baelor	 lt is not your sword l want.
s01e09	Baelor	 Give me my daughters back.
s01e09	Baelor	 Give me my husband.
s01e09	Baelor	 l've lost them too, l'm afraid.
s01e09	Baelor	 Kill him, Robb.
s01e09	Baelor	 Send his head to his father.
s01e09	Baelor	 - He cut down ten of our men.
s01e09	Baelor	 You saw him.
s01e09	Baelor	 - He's more use to us alive than dead.
s01e09	Baelor	 Take him away and put him in irons.
s01e09	Baelor	 We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives.
s01e09	Baelor	 You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters.
s01e09	Baelor	 Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
s01e09	Baelor	 lf we do it your way, Kingslayer you'd win.
s01e09	Baelor	 We're not doing it your way.
s01e09	Baelor	 Come on, pretty man.
s01e09	Baelor	 - l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
s01e09	Baelor	 - The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
s01e09	Baelor	 Aye.
s01e09	Baelor	 But the dead won't hear them.
s01e09	Baelor	 One victory does not make us conquerors.
s01e09	Baelor	 Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
s01e09	Baelor	 Could l have one? A lemon oneor any of them.
s01e09	Baelor	 Three coppers.
s01e09	Baelor	 - How about a nice fat pigeon? - Oh, piss off now.
s01e09	Baelor	 Go on.
s01e09	Baelor	 Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones? Piss off! Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening? - They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Who? The Hand of the King.
s01e09	Baelor	 - Traitor! - Coward! Baelor.
s01e09	Baelor	 Baelor! Traitor! Traitor!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Look at me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Keep your mouth shut, boy.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l'm not a boy! You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lt had three eyes.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lt told me to come with him, so l did.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Your father's not down there, little lord.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Not for many years yet.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - You're afraid.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Just like Hodor.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You've lived beyond the Wall.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 That's Lyanna, my father's sister.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Robert started a war to win her back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 That's where l saw Father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You see? He's not here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Here, Shaggydog.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Rickon! That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels! - He doesn't like chains.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - What are you doing down here? - Come back up with us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - No, l came to see Father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He was down here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l saw him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Saw him when? Last night, when l was sleeping.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Here, Shaggydog.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You both miss him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that Bran - My lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - My lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - My lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - My lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Robb.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Robb! You've ruined your sword.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Shh! Shh! - Shh! - l'll kill them all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Every one of them.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Shh.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l will kill them all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My boy.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They have your sisters.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 We have to get the girls back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And then we will kill them all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	  The boar's great tusks, they boded ill  For good King Robert's health  And the beast was every bit as fat  As Robert was himself  But our brave king cried, "Do your worst!  "l'll have your ugly head!  "You're nowhere near as murd'rous as  "The lion in my bed"  King Robert lost his battle and  He failed his final test  The lion ripped his balls off, and  The boar did all the rest  Very amusing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l'm so sorry, Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l'll never sing it again, l swear.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue? Your Grace? Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Good.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Tongue it is.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Your Grace, please.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l won't sing, Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence? l beg you! Please, no.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 No! Your Grace, please.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l beg you, l will never sing again! - l'm done for the day.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - No! l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Your Grace, please! You look quite nice.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Thank you, my lord.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - "Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	" l'm King now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Stop! No! Walk with me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l want to show you something.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do as you're bid, child.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 .
s01e10	Fire and Blood	.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	and as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Mother says that shouldn't be long.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 No! Please, no! This one's your father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 This one here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - You promised to be merciful.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l was.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l gave him a clean death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Look at him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Please let me go home.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l won't do any treason, l swear Mother says l'm still to marry you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 So you'll stay hereand obey.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Look at him! Well? How long do l have to look? As long as it pleases me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do you want to see the rest? lf it please Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 That's your Septa there.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Or maybe he'll give me yours.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Ser Meryn.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Here, girl.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Save yourself some pain, girl.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Give him what he wants.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You'll be needing that again.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Renly is not the king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He put your father to death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 That doesn't make Renly king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He's Robert's youngest brother.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do you mean to declare us for Stannis? - Renly is not right! - My lords.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - lf we put ourselves behind Stannis - My lords! Here is what l say to these two kings.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North! l'll have peace on those terms.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The King in the North! Am l your brother, now and always? Now and always.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! - Lady Stark.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l want to see him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Now! Leave us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Widowhood becomes you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Your bed must be lonely.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Oh, l do like a violent woman.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l will kill you tonight, ser pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Let me show you how Hit me again, over the ear.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And again and again.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You're stronger than you look.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lt shouldn't take long.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 But l don't, my lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The dark is coming for all of us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why cry about it? Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, - if the gods are just.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice? Because of men like you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 There are no men like me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Only me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My son Bran.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 How did he come to fall from that tower? l pushed him out the window.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why? lhoped the fall would kill him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why? You should get some sleep.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lt's going to be a long war.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l can't believe we're actually at war.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? - What's our next move? - Stop talking.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Get back into bed.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They have my son.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 ls it true about Stannis and Renly? Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Jaime captured, his armies scattered lt's a catastrophe.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Perhaps we should sue for peace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 There's your peace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He's winning - in case you hadn't noticed.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l'm told we still have his sisters.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 No truces.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 We can't afford to look weak.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 We should march on them at once.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise They have my son! Get out, all of you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Not you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You were right about Eddard Stark.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 But now Madness.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Madness and stupidity.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l always thought you were a stunted fool.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Perhaps l was wrong.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Half wrong.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l'm new to strategy, but Unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 No one will stay here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And you will go to King's Landing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - And do what? - Rule.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest - - Baelish, Varys, Pycelle - Heads, spikes, walls.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me? You're my son.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Oh, one more thing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You will not take that whore to court.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do you understand? Ser Jorah? Gently, gently.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My son Where is he? l want him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Where is he? The boy did not live.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Tell me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - What is there to tell? How did my son die? He never lived, my princess.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The women say What do the women say? - They say the child was - Monstrous, twisted.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l pulled him out myself.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When l touched him the skin fell from his bones.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lnsidehe was full of graveworms.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l warned you that only death can pay for life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You knew the price.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Show me what l bought with my son's life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 As you command, lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Come.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l will take you to him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Time enough for that later - l want to see him now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The khalasar is gone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 A khal who cannot ride is no khal.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The Dothraki follow only the strong.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l'm sorry, my Princess.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Drogo! My sun and stars.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why is he out here alone? He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He lives.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You asked for life, you paid for life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 This is not life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When will he be as he was? When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When the seas go dry.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Leave us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l have nothing more to fear from this woman.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Go.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lt was wrong of them to burn my temple.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - lt angered the Great Shepherd.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - This is not God's work.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - My child was innocent.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - lnnocent? He would have been the stallion who mounts the world.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Now he will burn no cities.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l spoke for you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l saved you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 ln the streets l saw piles of heads the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of feverjust three moons past.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Sotell me again exactly what it was that you saved? Your life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why don't you take a look at your khal Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You can't! Get out of my way, Sam.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They'll put out the word.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They'll send out ravens.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 People will come after you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do you know what happens to deserters? Better than you do.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 What are you going to do? l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You can't leave us now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 We need you here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Move.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l won't let you go.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Move.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - No.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Hyah! Hand of the King? So it would seem.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing? No, he said l couldn't take you with me to King's Landing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - He was very specific on that point.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - He knew my name? What? He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"? l believe he used the word "whore".
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out? l'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My father's probably the most powerful man in the country.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Certainly the richest.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He's always been a cunt.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the king needs a Hand and the Hand l know what a Hand needs.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Ghost? Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Samwell! - ls he dead? - No, he's not dead.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Did we get him? Come on, help me get him up.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Lucky you've got plenty of padding.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 We're taking you back to where you belong.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l belong with my brother.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - But we're your brothers now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They'll kill you if they know you came after me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Go back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Sam told us everything.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - We're sorry about your father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - But it doesn't matter.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You took the oath.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You can't leave.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l have to.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - You can't.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - You said the words.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - l don't care about "Hear my words and bear witness to my vow" - To hell with all of you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - "Night gathers and now my watch begins.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 "lt shall not end until my death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 "l shall live and die at my post.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	" "l am the sword in the darkness" "The watcher on the walls" "The shield that guards the realms of men.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 "l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, "for this night and all nights to come.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	" Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You're a fighter.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You've always been a fighter.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l need you to fight now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When the sun rises in the west .
s01e10	Fire and Blood	.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	and sets in the east .
s01e10	Fire and Blood	.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The thing you need to understand about kings is For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Yes.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And keep on serving them.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Aerys Targaryen.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us madness is the worst.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He was a good man.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Such a charmer.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 To watch him melt away before my eyes consumed by dreams of fire and blood Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal - powerful man, great warrior - but alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Now l serve his son King Joffrey may the gods bless his reign.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He is a capable young man - strong military mind.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Stern.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Mmm.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 True greatness.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 So what's the thing? What thing? About kings.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings" What? Things? What? When you started, you Never mind.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Let me see you out, my dear.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - lt's all right.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 No need.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Yes, yes.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Till the next time.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Right.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years? lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 A man with great ambition and no morals - l wouldn't bet against you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there? l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Oh, you can do better than that.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? - l've always wondered.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs? l picturea gash.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Like a woman's.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 ls that about right? l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Must be strange for you, even after all these years a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all Am l? That is good to know.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash? But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l admire you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And l admire you, Lord Baelish.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men - and women.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Playing our roles.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Serving a new king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Long may he reign.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - My king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - My king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My lords.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Shall we begin? You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 No one asks an orphan too many questions, cos nobody gives three shits.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 What's your name? Arry.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You've a long way to travel, and in bad company.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l've 20 this time - men and boys all bound for the Wall.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 This lot - half of them would turn you over to the king quick as spit for a pardon.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 So keep to yourself - and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You stay with this lot, boy.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Watch yourself, midget.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He's got a sword, this one.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword? - Maybe he's a little squire.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - He ain't no squire.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Look at him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 He looks like a girl.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l bet he stole that sword.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Let's have a look.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l could use me a sword like that.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Take it off him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Give it here, midget.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Look at him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l've seen him kick a boy to death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l kicked him all to pieces.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - You better give me that sword! - You want it? l'll give it to you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l already killed one fat boy.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l bet you never killed anyone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l bet you're a liar.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 But l'm not.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l'm good at killing fat boys.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l like killing fat boys.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When l hit that steel, it sings.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Where'd you steal it? - lt was a gift.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - lt don't matter now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Where we're going, they don't care what you've done.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen murderers.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Which are you? - Armourer's apprentice.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 But my master got sick of me, so here l am.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall! And winter is coming! Ham.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You look exhausted.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Was your moonlight ride that tiring? Don't look so terrified.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Honor made you leave, honor brought you back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 My friends brought me back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l didn't say it was your honor.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - They killed my father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - And you're gonna bring him back to life? No? Good.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 We've had enough of that sort of thing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours? No.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne? - No.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 - Good.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Beyond the Wall? l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l mean to find out what's happening.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the white walkers and whatever else is out there.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l will command them myself.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow Move out! .
s01e10	Fire and Blood	.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war? ls this your command, Khaleesi? Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Sell them.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You can return to the free cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 They were not given to me to sell.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Khaleesi, my Queen l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be but let him go, Khaleesi.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l know what you intend.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Do not.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l must.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You don't understand Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l won't watch you burn.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l see the faces of slaves.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l free you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Take off your collars.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Go if you wish, no one will stop you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 You swore to obey me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	 l am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Well struck.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Well struck, dog.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Did you like that? It was well struck, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I already said it was well struck.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Yes, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Who's next? Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard! Here I am.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Here I am.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Sorry, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My deepest apologies.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Are you drunk? - No.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - I had two cups of wine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Two cups? That's not much at all.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Please, have another cup.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Are you sure, Your Grace? Yes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 To celebrate my name day.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Have two.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Have as much as you like.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I would be honored, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 See that he drinks his fill.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You can't.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What did you say? Did you say I can't? I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What kind of stupid peasant's superstition The girl is right.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Take him away.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He is a fool.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You're so clever to see it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He'll make a much better fool than a knight.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos? From this day, you'll be my new fool.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Thank you, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And you, my lady, thank you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Beloved nephew.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We looked for you on the battlefield.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You were nowhere to be found.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What a fine job you've done.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Look at you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 More beautiful than ever.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And you! You're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 This one doesn't like me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Can't imagine why.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - We heard you were dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - I'm glad you're not dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Me, too, dear.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Death is so boring, especially now, with so much excitement in the world.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But still her father.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Surely, having so recently lost your own beloved father, you can sympathize.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My father was a traitor.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My mother and brother are traitors, too.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Of course you are.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What work? Why are you here? A raven arrived from the citadel this morning, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The conclave has met, considered reports from maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done at last.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The longest summer in living memory.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 A common superstition.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If it lasts any longer, we'll have fewer peasants.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We have nowhere to house them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You command the city watch, do you not, Lord Slynt? I do, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And are you not a lord at my command? I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Then do your job.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Shut the gates to the peasants.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They belong in the field, not our capital.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Yes, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Don't get up.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 More ravishing than ever, big sister.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 War agrees with you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Forgive the interruption.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Carry on.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What are you doing here? It's been a remarkable journey.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell, I fought with the hill tribes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What are you doing here? This is the small council.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Our father is Hand of the King.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Yes, but in his absence Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Out! All of you out! I would like to know how you tricked Father into this.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If I were capable of tricking Father, I'd be emperor of the world by now.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You brought this on yourself.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I've done nothing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Quite right, you did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Now the entire North has risen up against us.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - I tried to stop it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Did you? You failed.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Robb Stark is a child.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Who's won every battle he's fought.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Do you understand we're losing the war? - What do you know about warfare? - Nothing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But I know people.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Joffrey is king.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Joffrey is king.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You are here to advise him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm only here to advise him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And if the king listens to what I say, the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 How? You love your children.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It's your one redeeming quality.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That and your cheekbones.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The Starks love their children as well.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - And we have two of them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - One.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - One? - Arya, little animal, she disappeared.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You chopped one's head off and let another escape.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Father will be furious.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother and all our Northern sons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Men worked back then.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Today, my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Gods forbid it rains.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 King Robb.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And it's not his war.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He didn't choose it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Maybe not, my lord, but he called in his banners and took the men.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Do you remember your vows, ser? Of course I remember! We can spare four masons for a week, my lord.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Will that be sufficient to repair your walls? I believe it will.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We didn't want him here all day, did we? I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Nor did I.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lord Portan.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother and all our Northern sons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Makes all your pain go away.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Don't have any pain.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lucky for you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That way.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You've been having those dreams again.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I don't dream.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Everyone dreams.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I don't.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Heard some of the men talking about the comet.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They say it's an omen.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Did they? I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood to mark the death of your father.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The stars don't fall for men.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Red comet means one thing, boy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The dragons are all dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They've been dead for centuries.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Mmm.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi? He said they ate meat.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He didn't tell you what kind of meat? My brother didn't know anything about dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He didn't know anything about anything.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Eh.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 She was Drogo's first gift to me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I remember.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I promised to protect them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Promised them their enemies would die screaming.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 How do I make starvation scream? A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Does it ever end? This is further east than I've ever been.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the Red Waste.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And you're sure there's no other way? If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No one will take my dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They are too weak to fight, as are your people.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You must be their strength.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 As you are mine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Take our remaining horses.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What do we seek, Khaleesi? Cities, living or dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Caravans and people.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Rakharo.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You are my last hope, blood of my blood.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I will not fail you, blood of my blood.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You never have.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 This is bad time to start.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Having a rough time of it? Nothing's killed me yet.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your arse killed the sledge.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - You offered me a ride.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I was born in a place like this.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Later, I fell on hard times.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Are those girls? Craster's daughters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I haven't seen a girl in six months.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What, he don't like people messing with his daughters? He don't like people messing with his wives.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And on and on it goes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - That's foul.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - It's beyond foul.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Craster's still here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He must be doing something right.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What happens to the boys? Hmm? He marries his daughters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What does he do with his sons? He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 People make all sorts of plans.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Haven't missed him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Always treated me like scum.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Haven't had any good wine for a long time.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We're not Southerners.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name? - Jon Snow.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But now you're in the North, the real North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The lad meant no harm.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Now, sit down and shut your mouth.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You bring any of that good wine with you? We did.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We passed through six villages on the way here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 All six were abandoned.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Where have all the wildlings gone? I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Bring it in here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Yes, Commander.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You want to know where they've all gone? North, to join up with Mance Rayder.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your old friend.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He's no friend of mine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Aye.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But once he was just a poor black crow.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He's been calling himself that for years.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere? That's a good-looking ax.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Fresh forged? Give it here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You'll have another one made at Castle Black.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That's some lovely steel.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your Southern Kings.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And where does he plan marching this army? When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 These are bad times to be living alone in the wild.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The cold winds are rising.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Let them come.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My roots are sunk deep.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 This is our place.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Our husband keeps us safe.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Better to live free than die a slave.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed? We chose different paths.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 A roof would be welcome.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It's been hard riding.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And I see this one staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your roof, your rules.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Who am I? - Who am I? - Lord Commander.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - And who are you? - Jon Snow.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Who are you? Your steward.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You want to lead one day? Then learn how to follow.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We offer you these false gods.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The stars will bleed.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We need to stop her.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas - Not now.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 and the dead shall rise in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 All you men were named in the light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors? You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Do you want to stop me? Stop me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And that sword shall be Lightbringer.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Stannis Baratheon, Warrior of Light, your sword awaits you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lord, cast your light upon us! For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 For the night is dark and full of terror.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Stannis is our king.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We follow where he leads, - even if we don't like the path.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - King.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I don't serve the others.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I serve Stannis.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If you tell him the truth What's the truth? "And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert" He wasn't my beloved brother.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I didn't love him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He didn't love me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 A lie.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Take it out.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 "That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, "the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest "between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - "By right of birth" - Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Call him what he is.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 "And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
s02e01	The North Remembers	" "By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim" Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 "Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 "By right of birth and blood, "I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 "Let all true men declare their loyalty.
s02e01	The North Remembers	" When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'll not make the same mistake.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The time has come to choose.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself king.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Well, many have already declared for him, Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The Lord of Light stands behind him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet? - He has no need for ships.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I've always served thieves according to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I owe you an apology, my king.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My duty is to serve.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You have chosen the new god over the old gods.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 May the Lord of Light watch over us all.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Shall we drink together? Don't.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 A cup of wine to honor the one true god.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 King in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, "Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 "Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.
s02e01	The North Remembers	" You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle? Oh, I trust them with my life, just not with yours.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Smart boy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What's wrong? Don't like being called "boy"? Insulted? You insult yourself, Kingslayer.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You've been defeated by a boy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You're held captive by a boy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He's your bastard son.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 How convenient for him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My father learned the truth.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That's why you had him executed.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And you, you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives? I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No, but he's starting to know me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It's better than three defeats.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 This city stinks.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Like dead bodies.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 A bit corpsey, yes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And shit.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I thought you wanted to come here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I love it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You love the smell of dead bodies and shit? And cum and garlic and rum.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You can smell cum from the balcony? I love the stink.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I love the noise.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Cities make me want to fuck.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And so did the country.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 This is where I belong.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Yes, well, you need to be careful.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No one can know you're here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No one will know.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They're all liars, good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What about you? Me? I'm not from here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm a slave to the truth.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Why do you think I am so little? I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Ned Stark actually slept on this.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lord Baelish.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Of course, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya, we can't seem to locate her.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Curious.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Whoever finds her Well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Well, you could ask Varys where she is.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He'll have an answer for you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Whether you believe it Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Who knows what they want? A mockingbird.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - You created your own sigil, didn't you? - Yes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Appropriate, for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm glad you like it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Others have to find their own way.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He loved the eldest daughter.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Sadly, she had eyes for another.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And when those affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And which truth is that? Knowledge is power.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Seize him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Cut his throat.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Stop.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Wait.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I've changed my mind.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Let him go.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Step back three paces.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Turn around.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Close your eyes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Power is power.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I would very much appreciate it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You're Ser Alton Lannister? I am, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 First, your family must release my sisters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Their families can honor them with proper funerals.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - An honorable request, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Third Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The King in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - King in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - King in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 These are Your Grace, these are These are my terms.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If not, I will litter the South with Lannister dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That will be all for tonight.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 A word, Your Grace? You don't have to call me "Your Grace" when no one's around.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It's not so bad once you get used to it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know? Of course they are.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And we can't take King's Landing without ships.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Men who fought my father.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm his only living son.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He'll listen to me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I know he will.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm not a Stark.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I know that.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But your father raised me to be an honorable man.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We can avenge him together.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I need his ships.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They say he has 200.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Shall we rally them to fight for us? I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Yes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Before me, it was Father.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You married one rebel and mothered another.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You want to leave Sansa in the queen's hands? And Arya I haven't heard a word about Arya.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What are we fighting for, if not for them? It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It's time for me to go home.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You can't go to Winterfell.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I beg your pardon? I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Why in the name of all the gods Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He's rallied an army of 100,000.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You know him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You know his family.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You have a hundred other lords Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We'll get the girls back.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Then we'll all go home, for good.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I will ride at first light.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We will all be together again soon, I promise.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You've done so well.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Your father would be proud.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Give Lord Renly my regards.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - King Renly.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 There's a king in every corner now.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 What is all this? Returning this room to its proper appearance.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That is a seat for a conqueror.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We can't find Arya Stark.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Perhaps.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 But if not, we need her.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I think they might.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They're weak.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 They put too much value on their women.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Send out as many men as we can.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I'm sure if you asked Grandfather The king does not ask, he commands.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 His life is in danger.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We're at war.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 All our lives are in danger.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 And you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 It's not a claim.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 The throne is mine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Of course it is.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No one believes this foul gossip.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Someone believes it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella? What are you asking? I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 How many bastards does he have running What you just did is punishable by death.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You will never do it again.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Never.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 That will be all, Mother.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No, no, no, no.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Slowly, with passion.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Oh, yeah.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Go wash yourselves.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Put some clothes on.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Both of you are working tonight.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 We do things differently here, Daisy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Haystack Hall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Wherever you're from.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Our establishment doesn't cater to plowmen and goat herders.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lord Olsen.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Taste is everything here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Littlefinger's a fancy man.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Don't call him Littlefinger.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 He doesn't like it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lord Baelish.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 She grew up just down the road in Flea Bottom.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 She's beautiful.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Lord Commander.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Good to see you again.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Coin which goes in many pockets.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Orders.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Whose orders? Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No, you can't.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No! Please! No! Not my Barra! - Please.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Please.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Enough.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Get it done.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Kill the bastard.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No, no! - Please.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Give it here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 No, please.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Spread out.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Search every house.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Every room.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Look in every room.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Gendry! His name is Gendry.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 Where is the bastard? The Night's Watch! Please, stop! Where? They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - How will we know him? - He's got a bull's head helmet.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - He made it himself.
s02e01	The North Remembers	 - Find him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Gotta be ready before nightfall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Now keep it moving.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Put a watch on the ridge and the tree lines.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Lovely boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What do you want? A man has a thirst.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A man does not drink for a day and a night.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A boy could make a friend.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have friends.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Give us beer before I skin you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A man does not choose his companions.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 These two, they have no courtesy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A man must ask forgiveness.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're called Arry? This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar, once of the Free City of Lorath Beer, you little shit.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Get us beer! You should have asked nicely.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Aah! Come closer and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That boy has more courage than sense.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Come here! Yoren said none of us were to go near those three.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Come here! They don't scare me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Hmm? Then you're stupid.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They scare me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What are gold cloaks doing so far from King's Landing? What are you doing? They're looking for me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You in command here? You're a long way from home.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I asked you a question.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Aye, you did.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You asked without manners and I chose not to answer.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have a royal warrant for one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Well, the thing is these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Does it? It's a funny thing, people worry so much about their throats that they forget about what's down low.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Or I could nick this artery in your leg.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We'll just keep that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Good steel is always needed on the Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Seems you have a choice, you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home, or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We're looking for a boy named Gendry.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He carries a bull's head helmet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We'll be back with more men and I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 My lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It was quite a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And I tell him the story of how we meet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 To find so lovely a creature working in your father's kitchens It almost beggars belief.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Strange things do happen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You should taste her fish pie.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - How can you tell? - I can always tell.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We'll make a fisherman of him yet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Friends are such an important part of life.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 But rest easy, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Your discretion is legendary Where your friends are concerned.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 How unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I will leave you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 This city is made brighter by your presence.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We have a council meeting, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't like threats.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Who threatened you? I'm not Ned Stark.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I understand the way this game is played.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Ned Stark was a man of honor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And I am not.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Threaten me again and I'll have you thrown into the sea.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You might be disappointed in the results.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Storms come and go, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Come, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 CERSEl: "From this time until the end of time, "we are not part of your realm, "but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 " He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We can give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin? I will, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest? I did.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I will, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Safe travels, cousin.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 If that's everything A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Trouble with the wildlings.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That's why they're called "wildlings.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 " Somewhat less wild these days.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this king-beyond-the-Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Another king? How many is that now? Five? I've lost count.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man the Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We have no men to spare.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 "The cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 " The northerners are a superstitious people.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Mormont doesn't lie.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 How do you kill a dead man? Apparently you burn him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 One trip to the Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you: the Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have every confidence that the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And I said, "If the gods wanted us to have dignity, "they wouldn't make us fart when we died.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 " We fart when we die? My blessed mother, I was holding her hand when she left this world.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Wouldn't two or three be enough for him? We were having a serious discussion.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Would you look at that? Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I prefer watching them come towards me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm sure that's nice, too.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We were wrestling together from the time we were six years old.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And then we got older and the wrestling changed.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You were with her? How many times? Well, as many times as I could.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I wish I grew up on a farm.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We need more potatoes.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Get another sack from the sledge.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Get the turnips, too.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Ghost, no.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No! Ghost, away.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Shoo.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Shoo! You all right? - Did he frighten you? - You shouldn't touch me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Oh.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Oh, right.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm sorry.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're very brave.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What are you doing? This is Gilly.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She's one of Craster's daughters.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Hello, Gilly.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What are you doing? Sam said you could help.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm sorry, but Sam knows we're not supposed She's pregnant.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We have to take her with us when we leave.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What? - What would that I know it sounds a bit mad.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No, it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - The Lord Commander ordered us to - We are sworn to protect.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Sam, we can't take - Please, sir, please.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I can still run if I have to.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - It's just not possible.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - I'm going to have a baby.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 If it's a boy If it's a boy, what? You want us to risk our lives for you and you won't even tell us why? - Why'd you do that? - Do what? Ask her a question? - You were cruel.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Cruel? Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand? - I didn't touch her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - No, you just want to steal her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What do you think Craster cuts off for that? I can't steal her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She's a person, not a goat.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We can't take a girl with us.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Mormont wouldn't have it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's going to deliver a baby, you? I could try.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What? I've read about it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A bit.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm sorry, Sam.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We can't help her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Khaleesi.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - You don't need to see this.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - He is blood of my blood.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Who did this? - Khal Pono, perhaps.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Khal Jhaqo.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They don't like the idea of a woman leading a khalasar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They will like it far less when I am done with them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They killed his soul! Shh.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They cannot kill his soul.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They did! They butchered him like an animal.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They did not burn his body.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He can neverjoin his ancestors in the night lands.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Shh.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We will build him a funeral pyre.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Is it as you remember, my lord? It looks smaller.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Everything looks bigger when you're a child.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I remember my father's cabin felt like a palace when I was little.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Now look at it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Who will? Anyone who matters.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 This is a big day for them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They haven't had much to get excited about since I left.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It's a hard place, the Iron Islands.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Always has been.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It's cold and it's wet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Oh, I love the cold and wet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They say hard places breed hard men.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And hard men rule the world.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Then you'll be king before long.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Try smiling with your lips closed.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Better.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 My father doesn't trust you Iron Islanders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't blame him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He says that you're all reavers and rapers and that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be sat Quit talking about your father.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 But he's right about us.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That's not enough for us.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That's why we take salt wives, the women we capture.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Capture me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Take me with you when you go ashore.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Make me your salt wife.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Your place is on this ship.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Not after you leave.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Father will punish me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He'll call me a whore.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I haven't paid you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Oh, yeah.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I paid good money I'm not going to stand for this.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I barely touched her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Now, you charge twice as much as every other brothel and this is what I get, crying.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 One moment, my friend.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A moment.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Please accept my sincerest apologies.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Aremca will take good care of you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm sorry, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Did he hurt you? No, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It's Mhaegen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Who? She works for you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She's the one The gold cloaks, - they killed her baby.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Ah, yes.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That was poorly handled.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I can't stop thinking about it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I can't sleep.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Her poor little baby.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You know, you remind me of another girl, a lovely thing I once acquired from a Lysene pleasure house.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent, like yourself.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 But she wasn't happy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She cried often.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I asked her why, but we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Yes, it was quite sad.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses are expensive, extremely expensive.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And this one wasn't making me any money.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I hate bad investments.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Really, I do.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They haunt me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 To use her in ways that would never occur to most men.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 But you know what occurs to most men.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I would not say he succeeded in making her happy, but my losses were definitely mitigated.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'll see you tomorrow.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And you'll be happy? That makes me happy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 More wine? Damn it, boy! Apologies, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Leave us, Podrick.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I believe we know how to pour our own wine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That's your new squire? I could've found you a proper lad.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That's a good red.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Dornish? You know your wines, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That I do.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A fine dinner, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Call me Tyrion, please.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Wars have been started for less.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Mmm.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Nasty business.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Had to be done.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Yes, of course.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The City Watch must keep the peace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Orders are orders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Quite right.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Especially the Queen's orders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I never said they were the Queen's orders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You know your sister better than I do.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister? I don't listen to filth.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That's good of you, but you have heard them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Joffrey is my king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The rest doesn't interest me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I appreciate your loyalty.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order? I did.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And I would again.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The man was a traitor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He tried to buy my loyalty.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The fool.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He had no idea you were already bought.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an imp! I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm denying its existence.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And, yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What are you My friends at court will not allow this! - The Queen herself has granted - The Queen Regent.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No, we shan't.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 There's a ship leaving for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 From there, I'm afraid, it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I hope you enjoy the Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I found it surprisingly beautiful in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The lads will escort you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 These men are under my command! I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 His name is Bronn, and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Boys.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have friends at court, powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord! To the new commander.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 If I told you to murder an infant girl, say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question? Without question? No.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'd ask, "How much?" If they come back, I say we yield.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Gendry's the one they want.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I ain't afraid of no battles.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I've seen lots of battles.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - I saw - Liar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Stabbed him right in the neck.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Two men fighting isn't a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - They had armor on.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - So? So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No, it isn't.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What does a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway? Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes a fight into a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It's when they've got armor on.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Who told you that? A knight.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 How'd you know he was a knight? Well, it was 'cause he'd got armor on.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You don't have to be a knight to have armor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Any idiot can buy armor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 How do you know? 'Cause I sold armor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What do the gold cloaks want with you? - No idea.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - You're a liar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You know, you shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't care what any of them want.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No good's ever come of their questions.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No good's ever come? Who asked questions before? How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my arse? Who asked questions? The Hand of the King.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Hands of the King.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Lord Arryn came first a few weeks before he died, and then Lord Stark came a few weeks before he died.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Lord Stark? See? Asking me questions is bad luck.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You'll probably be dead soon.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - What did they ask about? - My mum.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Who's your mum? - Just my mum, worked in a tavern, died when I was little.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And who was your father? Could've been one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What about you anyway? You thought they were after you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Why? Did you kill someone or is it just because you're a girl? - I'm not a girl.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Yes, you are.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Do you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them? Stupider.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - I am not! Yeah? Well, pull your cock out and take a piss, then.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't need to take a piss.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No one can know.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Well, they won't.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Not from me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 My name's not Arry.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It's Arya, of House Stark.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He was never a traitor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Joffrey is a liar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 So you're a highborn, then.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're a lady.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I mean, yes.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 My mother was a lady and my sister Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter, and you lived in a castle and you Look, all that about cocks, I should never have said And I've been pissing in front of you and everything.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I should be calling you "my lady.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 " - Do not call me "my lady.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 " - As my lady commands.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Well, that was unladylike.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Oh! What's she carrying? Myrish oranges, wine from the Arbor and the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't like wine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Woman's drink.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I need to get to Pyke.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'll find you a horse.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm heading that way.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I can take you there.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I bet you can.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Have you been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from? - None like you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - You don't know what I'm like.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Maybe you don't know what you're like.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Maybe you need someone to teach you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Do you know who I am? You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry, Lord Greyjoy? Have my things sent up to the castle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You should give me the reins.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm a better rider than you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I've been on horseback for the past nine years.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Nine years? Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope? Don't you worry about my hands.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The sea is in my blood.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have a proposal for my father, one that will make him king again, and me after him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You may get to stay in a castle tonight if you're lucky.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Is that an offer from my future king? An order from your future king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You can tell your grandchildren about this night.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Father.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What have they given back? A man.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Your blood and your heir.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - We shall see.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Stark had you longer than I did.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Lord Stark is gone.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And how do you feel about that? What's done is done.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Who gave you those clothes? Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter? If my clothes offend you, I will change them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You will.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That bauble round your neck, did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold? I asked a question.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold? Gold.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 My fears have come true, the Starks have made you theirs.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - My blood is salt and iron.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Yet the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven clutching his message.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The offer he makes is one I proposed.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - He heeds your counsel? - I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He thinks of me as a brother.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No, not here, not in my hearing.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You will not name him brother, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Or have you forgotten your own blood? I forget nothing.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I remember my brothers.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And I remember when my father was a king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I see.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - I will lead the attack myself.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Oh, you will? I'm your son, your only living heir.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Who else? I told you to wait outside.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 How did you get past the guards? Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 My dear.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Yara? So good to see you, brother.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - She can't lead an attack! And why not? You're a woman! - You're the one in skirts.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - This isn't Winterfell, boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - What's dead may never die.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 -  dead may never die.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The only nights she's spent off these islands have been spent on the sea.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She's commanded men.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She's killed men.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She knows who she is.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 No man gives me a crown.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I pay the iron price.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I will take my crown, for that is who I am.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That is who we have always been.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Who said anything about the Lannisters? You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance? Because you're a smart gambler.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Stannis has proved himself in war twice.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Neither has the false King Joffrey.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And yet they both have larger armies.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Stannis has just begun the fight.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 His bannermen will rally to his cause.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon or more worthy of loyalty.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings? - Mind your words, pirate.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Matthos.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm an excellent pirate.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't sail for promises.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Of course you do.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise, a promise that somewhere on the sea, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - That's a promise that always comes true.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - As is mine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're not a young man, Salladhor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And correct me if I'm wrong, most pirates don't grow old.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Only the clever ones.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They're out there waiting for you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 That's easy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What I'm offering you is hard.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You'll be the richest man in Lys, and the most famous.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 "Salladhor Saan" is a good name for songs.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - It is.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - One thing, I want the queen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - The queen? - Cersei, I want her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I'll fuck her well.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 This war isn't about you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm not going to rape her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm going to fuck her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 As if she would just let you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You don't know how persuasive I am.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I've never tried to fuck you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Stannis is the rightful king and the Lord of Light, the one true god I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true gods.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 They all think they found the right one.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet, a queen's legs.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He's young yet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I promise you the gold.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I promise you the glory.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I cannot promise you the queen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You believe your king can win? He is the one true king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You Westerosi are funny people.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Make me rich.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 When will the king have us sail? As soon as his god wills it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He's my god, too, and yours, but you are too blind to see.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Let me teach you how to read.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Oh, you and your mother.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It won't take long.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You already know the letters.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I wish I had a god, truly.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every god there is, pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - None of it works.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - But you always came home.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I wasn't praying.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 But I was.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed for you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You want me to have a god? Fine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 King Stannis is my god.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He raised me up and blessed me with his trust.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He gave you a future I could never have imagined.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You know how to read.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You'll be a knight someday.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You think a fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis, only Stannis.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Don't tell him that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 CERSEl: Lord Janos Slynt was commander of the City Watch.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You had no right to exile him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have every right.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I am the King's Hand.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're serving as the King's Hand till Father gets here.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I am Queen Regent.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Listen to me, Queen Regent.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're losing the people.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Do you hear me? - The people.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You think I care? You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Half the city will starve when winter comes.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The other half will plot to overthrow you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And your gold-plated thugs just gave them their rallying cry, "The Queen slaughters babies.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 " You don't even have the decency to deny it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 He did what needed to be done.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is, lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root, one by one, before they strangle you in your sleep.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You haven't, Jaime hasn't.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It's all fallen on me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 As has Jaime, repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're funny.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You've always been funny but none of yourjokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember? Back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death? She was my mother, too.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Mother gone for the sake of you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 There's no biggerjoke in the world than that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 How did you fare with your pirate? Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 His men know how to fight.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 It does seem the wiser choice.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 There won't be a choice this time.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Do you trust him? Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I've known him 30 years.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I've never trusted him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Now, once he gets the smell of gold he never stops.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Leave us.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 At once, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Come.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 What did you say to him? I told him death by fire is the purest death.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 - Why? - Because it is true.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You're troubled, my king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Yeah.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Tell your lord to burn them, then.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I tell him nothing.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I pray for his commands and I obey.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 My little brother has 100,000 men, according to the scouts, men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You must have faith.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins, nine times out of ten.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 Then we must be the 1 Oth.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I cannot defeat my brother in the field.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And I can't take King's Landing without the men he's stolen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have seen the path to victory in the flames.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 But first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I've said the words, damn you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I burned the idols.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 You must give all of yourself.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I have a wife.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I took a vow.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She's sickly, weak Shut away in a tower.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 She disgusts you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 And she's given you nothing, no sons, only stillborns, only death.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 I will give you a son, my king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	 A son?
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	Out, all of you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 This bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't! I want you and your men gone.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And you will make this right.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Wait outside.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Lord Commander - Now! - Lord Commander - Leave us.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What did you do? I followed him.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What business is that of yours? No, you don't understand.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He's killing them, all the boys.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You know.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Those boys are Craster's offerings.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Offerings? He's murdering his own children.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He's a monster.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We have other wars to fight out there.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Like it or not, we need men like Craster.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I I saw it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I saw something take that child.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Yeah.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Now, ready my horse.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We leave at dawn.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Don't lose it again.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Gilly.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You're leaving.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I I wanted to give you something.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It belonged to my mother.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - I can't take it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Please.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I want you to.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 My mother used it for sewing.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 My father put a stop to it when he found out.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It's the only thing I have of hers.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You You shouldn't give it away.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm not giving it away.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm giving it to you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Keep it safe for me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Till I come back.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Hodor.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Every night it's the same.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 That's exactly what they are, Bran, - stories.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - So she was lying? - They don't exist? - Well, they may have done.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But they're gone from the world, along with much else.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No, my dreams are different.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Mine are true.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I dreamt of my father dying.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And Rickon had the same dream.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 This link is made of Valyrian steel.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I was no different.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I was young.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Come on.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 All right.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But not anymore.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The dragons are gone.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The giants are dead.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Loras! Highgarden! Get him! Oh! Yield! I yield.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Well fought.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Approach.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Rise.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Remove your helm.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You are all your father promised and more, my lady.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Now, now, my love.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 My brother fought valiantly for you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 That he did, my queen.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But there can only be one champion.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 If it is within my power, it is yours.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What? I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Done.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Lady Catelyn.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm pleased to see you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell? You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm so sorry for your loss.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You are most kind.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your Grace.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And you should kneel when you approach the King.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 There's no need for that.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Lady Stark is an honored guest.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet? I do not sit on my son's war councils.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Don't worry, my lady.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Our war is just beginning.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Your Grace.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Gerard.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - How's your foot? - Better, Your Grace.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 They don't know their own size is all.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Good man.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I have 100,000 men at my command.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? - I pity them.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Why? Because it won't last.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - She's tired from herjourney.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 At once, Your Grace.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Shall I return after? - That won't be necessary.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I would pray awhile.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Alone.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 If you'll follow me, my lady.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I fought for my king.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Die for him if I must.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm no lady.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What are you doing here? I live here.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Are you angry with me, brother? You lying bitch.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you you looked like a fat little boy.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to see who you were first.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And I did.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The plans are made.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It's time you heard them.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Father.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Father.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I've always wanted a castle.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And what's my role in all this? You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 A ship? You give her 30 and I get one? The Sea Bitch.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We thought she'd be perfect for you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm to fight fishermen? Be careful of their nets.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I know his men.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - He won't give up the North so easily.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - They won't even know we're there - until it's too late.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm not protecting anyone.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What are our words? Our words? - We do not sow.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - We do not sow.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We are ironborn.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We're not subjects.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We're not slaves.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We take what is ours.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You act as if I volunteered to go.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You gave me away, if you remember.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 After he crushed you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Did you take what was yours then? You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And now you curse me because I've come home.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You'd have our father bow down to your other family? I have no other family.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Our ships sail with or without you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You won't let me leave this room.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - You won't let me - Keep your voice down.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Why? You think your father can hear me? He's 300 miles away! I don't intend for you to stay here.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Again, only temporary.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But you wouldn't be a cook.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You'd pose as a scullion.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Scullion? What is a scullion? Kitchen wench.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - A kitchen wench? - Yes, but Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me? Your lion wants to see you alive.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We've come to a dangerous place.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 My sister wants to hurt me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 She'll look for any weakness she can find.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 She can't know about you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm the weakness? It's a compliment, my lady.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 How is being a weakness a compliment? Language can be a bit tricky here.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Oh.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm too stupid to understand.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The stupid foreign girl.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I am not a kitchen wench.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 When will Joffrey and Sansa be married? Soon, darling, when the war is over.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The Princess just spoke to you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Pardon, Your Grace.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother? He might.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Would you like that? No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I don't think so.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Won't you, little dove? Come in.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Who are you? I'm Shae, My Lady.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your new handmaiden.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - You're not from here.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What are you doing? Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You should just do them.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What things? Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - You said to brush Not now.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your chamber pot is empty.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Clean the table.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Have you ever been a handmaiden before? - Yes.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - For whom? - Lady Zuriff.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Lady Zuriff? Lady Zuriff.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 She wasn't in this city.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do yourjob.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Do you want me to leave? Just brush my hair.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Oh! Thank the gods.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I've encountered this problem before, my lord.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Two drops with water, daily.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Right.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Please.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Thank you, my lord.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not? Why, yes, of course, my lord.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 These are perilous times.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And the crown must forge new alliances.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Matrimony, huh? Yes.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 There's too much at stake.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Oh, yes, yes.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Indeed, yes.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I shall be silent as the grave.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Myrcella sent away to Dorne? But remember, the Queen mustn't know.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Ooh.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 "The Queen mustn't know.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 " I love conversations that begin this way.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - He fights for Robb Stark.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Precisely.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But remember, you must tell no one.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Tell no one what? I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Lysa is not fond of me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 She imprisoned you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 She tried to execute you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And you offer her son a princess? For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think? And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement? Who better? Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What's in it for me? The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold and Harrenhal.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Harrenhal is cursed.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Never took you for a superstitious man.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You'll be able to afford it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Until you snatched it away.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I didn't need Janos Slynt.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It's settled, then? Good.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Oh.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And remember The Queen mustn't know.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 That must hurt.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What? What is it? A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Brienne is a very capable warrior.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And she's devoted to me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You're jealous.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - I'll make it up to you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - No, Your Grace.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Not tonight.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 There's another Tyrell who requires your attention.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And Margaery's a virgin? Officially.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Shall I bring her to you? I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 As is your right.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You are a king.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You look very beautiful.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Thank you, Your Grace.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - It's a lovely gown.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - You think so? I can't decide how I like it better.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 This way, or this way.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You certainly don't need it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Must be the wine.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Here, let me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I'm sorry.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Do you want my brother to come in and help? - What? - He could get you started.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I know he wouldn't mind.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I don't know what you're talking about.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 There's no need for us to play games.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Save your lies for court.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You're going to need a lot of them.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your enemies aren't happy about us.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 They want to tear us apart.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We can try again later.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Whatever you need to do.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You are a king.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 CERSEl: You monster.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Myrcella is my only daughter.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore? Myrcella's a princess.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Some would say she was born for this.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Dorne is the safest place for her.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 That's why we need to seduce them.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - She'll be a hostage.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - A guest.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You won't get away with this.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - It's done, Cersei.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - You cannot stop it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - No! Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Get out! Get out! Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God? - I would.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Kneel.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Bless him with salt.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Bless him with stone.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Bless him with steel.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What is dead may never die.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But rises again harder and stronger.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Stand.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she? No, afraid not.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Sorry about that.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Yes, I fear so.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Sorry about that, too.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Leave me out of your next deception.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 That's a shame.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I would see him released.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 That's where you come in.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No, he won't.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But his mother might.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 How would you like to see your beloved Cat again? - Find him? - Oh, aye.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And he has company.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Filthy old stoat.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Almost hate to interrupt.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No, you don't.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No, I don't.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What is the meaning of this? No, please, please.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You disappoint me, Grand Maester.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I am your loyal servant.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No! Never! It's a falsehood.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I swear it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It wasn't me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Ah, Varys.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It was Varys the Spider.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No one but you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The eunuch has spies everywhere.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - No, no, no.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - There are no goats, halfman.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Well, make do.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 How long have you been spying for my sister? All I did, I did for House Lannister.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Always.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Your lord father, ask him.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - I don't like his beard.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - What? What? No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn? Lord Arryn, he knew.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He knew the truth about the Queen.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And he planned to act, to tell King Robert.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 So you poisoned him? No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Never.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Lannister I always served Lannister.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Get him out of my sight.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Throw him in one of the black cells.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No, no, no.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 No, please.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Don't! You can't do this to me! For your trouble.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Good.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 One of my better ideas.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell? Well played, My Lord Hand.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle The Small Council grows smaller every day.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Power is a curious thing, my lord.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Are you fond of riddles? Why, am I about to hear one? Three great men sit in a room.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 A king, a priest and a rich man.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Between them stands a common sellsword.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Who lives, who dies? Depends on the sellsword.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He has a sword, the power of life and death.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else? I've decided I don't like riddles.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Power resides where men believe it resides.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It's a trick, a shadow on the wall.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You should be sleeping.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Tomorrow's a long march.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I can't sleep.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I don't like the taste.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What? How do you sleep? Same as most men, I think.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But you've seen things, horrible things.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Aye.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head? You didn't see that.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I made damn sure.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I close my eyes and I see them up there.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 All of them standing there.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Joffrey, the Queen and and my sister.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You know, we've got something in common, me and you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He weren't much of a villain what skewered him.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Willem, the lad's name was.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He ran off before anyone could spit.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 And I just stood there, watching my brother die.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Here's the funny part.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I can't picture my brother's face anymore.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Willem.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Willem.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Willem.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 A prayer almost.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull they had to bury him with it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 That'll help you sleep, eh? Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Get up.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Get up.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Keep out of sight, both of you.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - No, I'm not afraid.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - I can fight.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Keep out of sight.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 If things go wrong, you run.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Outside, now! Come on, move, move! Gold cloaks! Everyone out! Hey, you! Open the damn cage! Where's the bastard, crow? Got more than a few bastards here.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Who's asking? Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 These men from the capital requested our assistance.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Drop your weapons in the name of the King.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Now, which king would that be? This is your last chance.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I don't think I will.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 So be it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I always hated crossbows.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Take too long to load.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Boy, come here.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Boy! - Sweet boy, help us.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 - Come back here! Help us, boy! A man can fight! Free us! Quick, give it to me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Give me the ax.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Give me that.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Put them on the wagon! There's more here.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Come on.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 What do we have here? No! That's a fine little blade.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I yield! I yield! Round up any survivors.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We'll take them back to Harrenhal.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You heard him.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You're coming with us.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 I yield! Help! Help me! Something wrong with your leg, boy? Look at it.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Can you walk? No.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You got to carry me.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 All right.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 "Carry him," he says.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 You want Gendry? You already got him.
s02e03	What is Dead May Never Die	 He loved that helmet.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	It's got to be the Mountain.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He's the biggest.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - He's the strongest.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Bulls are bigger than lions.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If he ever gets out.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Loras Tyrell? Loras Tyrell.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He's prettier than the Queen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I don't care about pretty.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He's better with a sword than any of them.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They get spooked by their own shadows.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Do you hear that? No.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 There's something out there.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Oh.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Oh, you're a right little prick.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You should see your face.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I swear you pissed yourself.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 "Oh, who goes there? Ahh!" There is something out there.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Yeah, don't even try me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Rennick.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Do you think I'm an idiot? Rennick! King in the North! The King in the North! Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They're dead.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Take everything they've got.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Barely enough food to feed our own.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Of course, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The officers will be useful.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I doubt it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Well, we'll learn soon enough.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 In my family, we say, "A naked man has few secrets.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 "A flayed man none.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 " My father outlawed flaying in the North.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - We're not in the North.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - We're not torturing them.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 No, don't! Don't! Please! The rot's set in.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 No, don't! No, don't! - Shh.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Please, don't! It'll get better.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It doesn't even hurt.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The rot will spread.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If we don't take the foot now No, you can't! Ser! Please, ser.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - I can't lose - You'll die if she doesn't.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I don't want to be a cripple, please.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your men are not my men, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Put this in your mouth and lie down.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You don't want to watch.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - No! You can't! - Bite on it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - What's your name? - Talisa.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your last name? You want to know what side my family fights on? You know my family name.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You have me at a disadvantage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 That boy lost his foot on your orders.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They killed my father.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - That boy did? - The family he fights for.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I have no hatred for the lad.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 That should help his foot grow back.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I understand.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - You're going to kill Joffrey? - If the gods give me strength.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - And then what? - I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We'll go back to Winterfell.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 So who will? I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after? First we have to win the war.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You never told me where you're from.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Volantis.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Volantis? You're far from home.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The boy was lucky you were here.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He was unlucky that you were.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You know that.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I beg you, please Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Thousands of good men were butchered.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Killing you would send your brother a message.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But my mother insists on keeping you alive.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Stand.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Meryn.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Leave her face.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I like her pretty.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Meryn, my lady is overdressed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Unburden her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What is the meaning of this? What kind of knight beats a helpless girl? The kind who serves his king, Imp.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Careful, now.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Someone get the girl something to cover herself with.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 She is to be your queen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Have you no regard for her honor? I'm punishing her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You can't talk to me like that.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The king can do as he likes! The Mad King did as he liked.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him? No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'm not threatening the king, ser.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am educating my nephew.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 That was a threat.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 See the difference? I apologize for my nephew's behavior.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Tell me the truth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Do you want an end to this engagement? I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The little king's backed up.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Clogged from balls to brains.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him? There's no cure for being a cunt.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But the boy's at that age.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What are you doing here, dog? Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And? What is it? Look inside, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Happy nameday, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - My nameday has passed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We won't tell if you won't.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 No.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Touch her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Could you hit her? My uncle sent you? Yes, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He chose us himself.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Hmm.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Use this.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Harder.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I said harder.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He'd want me to get his money's worth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Please, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your Grace, if your uncle finds out Oh, I want him to find out.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Begin.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Harder! Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron? I'm a practical man.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Just not a loyal one.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse? I don't like you, Lord Baelish.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I don't like your face.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 So tell me, why are you here? You can trust Brienne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Her loyalty comes without charge.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Now I understand.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You know I have the numbers.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You know I'm marching on King's Landing.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And your head.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I would give priority to my head.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Lord Baelish.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 All of these tents look the same to me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Would you be so kind - It would be my pleasure.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 "Your tent"? Not "Our tent"? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Four kings vying for the throne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then? You seem quite interested in our marriage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your marriage is quite interesting.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Not only to me, but to the realm.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You've never married, have you? I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 That is sad.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Though perhaps it's for the best.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My husband is my king, and my king is my husband.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Here is your tent, Lord Baelish.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Good night.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 This isn't your horse.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It was given to me by the Thirteen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Elders of Qarth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Qarth? Three days to the east, on the sea.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Will they let us in? They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What do you know of this place? Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Go on! - You, keep moving! Bring her about! What kind of fire melts stone? Dragon fire.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 There's dragons here? No, all the dragons are dead.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What's that smell? Dead people.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Move.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Please, please, no, no! No.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He's dead.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He was my son.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My sister was three days ago.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My husband, the day before that.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They take someone every day? Does anyone live? Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Cersei.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 llyn Payne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Hound.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Cersei.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 llyn Payne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Hound.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Cersei.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 llyn Payne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Hound.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 How dare you? You may have heard false reports.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - You betrayed Ned.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I begged him to seize the moment.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I trusted you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My husband trusted you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And you repaid our faith with treachery.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - No, my lady.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Get out! Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It seems to me that fate has given us this chance Have you lost your mind? Get out! Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever? You have Arya, too? Both girls are healthy and safe.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 For now.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What do you want? The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Of course they will.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'm not bringing these terms to him.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'm bringing them to you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You think I keep secrets from my son? Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Consider it, Cat.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You may not get another chance.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - I've brought you a gift.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - I don't want your gifts.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Good faith? What's this? Your husband was an honorable man.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - You may not believe - Get out.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Get up, you dogs! That's him, the one who picks.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Mountain.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What are you doing? He told me he stares at him every day.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 That's why he doesn't get picked.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Move, boy! Move! Is there gold and silver in the village? - I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Gems? I didn't see any.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Please.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Which of the villagers aided them? - I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Who? I - Who? - I never saw.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Please.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Please, stop.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Please, it's starting to - Who? - I didn't see anyone help him.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Take it off! Take it off! - Who helped him? - Ganes, the butcher, - and his son.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - That's better.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - You've been very helpful.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop! No! No! I told you everything! No! No! Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Cersei.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 llyn Payne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Hound.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Please, Polliver.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Some food.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Just a crust of bread.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Polliver.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Mountain.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Can that truly be you? - Who else might it be? When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Whose banner is that? - My own.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Why is your stag on fire? The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Watch yourself, Renly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 No, no, I'm relieved.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I never really believed you were a fanatic.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You should kneel before your brother.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He's the Lord's chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Born amidst salt and smoke? - Is he a ham? That's twice I've warned you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Listen to yourselves.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your husband was a supporter of my claim.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We share a common enemy.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Iron Throne is mine by right.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 All those that deny that are my foes.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 No one wants you for their king.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You never wanted any friends, brother.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But a man without friends is a man without power.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Otherwise I shall destroy you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Look across those fields, brother.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Can you see all those banners? You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king? No.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We shall see, Renly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Come the dawn, we shall see.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Look to your sins, Lord Renly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Would you believe I loved him once? I thought we were welcome.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Horde? My name is Daenerys Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You know me, my lord? Only by reputation, Khaleesi.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They call you the Mother of Dragons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And what should I call you? Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am simply a trader of spices.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - The beauty of Quarth is legendary - Qarth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Qarth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Might we see the dragons? My friend, we have traveled very far.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We have no food, no water.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Once I see my people fed, I would be honored Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am not a liar.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Oh, I don't think you are.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Then perhaps you should return to where you come from.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We wish you well.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We have received you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Here we are, and here you are.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If you do not let us in, all of us will die.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Which we shall deeply regret.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Khaleesi, please be careful.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Turn us away and we will burn you first.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Ah.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You are a true Targaryen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And so Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Thirteen have spoken.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Our decision is final.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Very well.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I invoke soumai.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Be it on your head.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Welcome to Qarth, my lady.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Is there gold or silver in the village? - I'm not from the village.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Where is the Brotherhood? I don't know what that is.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You two.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What's this? We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Evidently not.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Why are these prisoners not in their cells? Cells are overflowing, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 This lot won't be here long.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Don't need no permanent place.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 After we interrogate 'em, we usually just Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers? You, do you have a trade? Smith, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He'll do no such thing.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Why? - Safer to travel, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Smart.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 More than I can say for this lot.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Get these prisoners to work.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Bring the girl.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I need a new cupbearer.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your visits are too few, cousin.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Here's your warrant.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - So it is.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Instead she sends you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What am I to make of that? I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei? As I said several times.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And you've waited this long to deliver the information? When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 She often works from dusk till dawn.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Ah.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Lavender oil.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am a knight! An anointed knight, yes.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser? You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother? It's not my fault! Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight? Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Did he tell you to fuck her, too? I only meant I did as I was bid.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Wait here.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 His Grace will want to hear this.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Save it for Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 He loves a good grovel.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'll leave the city at once, I swear.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - No, I think not.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - My lord? You heard me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My father told you to obey my sister.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Obey her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Stay close to her side.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Keep her trust.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Pleasure her whenever she requires.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And you will tell me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Yes, my lord, I will.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I swear it, as you command.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Oh, rise, rise.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Let us drink to our understanding.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Oh, you don't have a cup.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Oh, well.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Smile, cousin.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But her demands? Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - You will? - Yes, I'll release him in the morning.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Stay within one table length.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Do your knucklebones bring you luck? Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And it's four less fingernails to clean.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Fewer.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Pardon? Four fewer fingernails to clean.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Never understood why you had to wear them.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It reminds me of yourjustice.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You were a hero and a smuggler.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Does he listen? - To me? Gods, no.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest She has a name.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I've lived within the law for 17 I want you to be a smuggler this time.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Any shore, any night.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 What am I bringing ashore? The red woman.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Cleaner ways don't win wars.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Are you afraid, Onion Knight? Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth? I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 A man is good or he is evil.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - And which are you? - Oh, good.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Well, that must be very nice for you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 - Do you love your wife? - I do.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Yet you have known other women.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Don't talk about my wife.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'm not.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 I'm talking about other women.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Like me, Ser Davos.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You want me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 You want to see what's beneath this robe.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And you will.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They are servants of light, the children of fire.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 These weren't here before.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They've barred the passage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 They can't bar our passage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 Gods protect us.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	 There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	- You swear it? - By the mother.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Then I see no reason for hostility between us.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Your son can go on calling himself King in the North.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And the wording of this oath? The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And in return for my son's loyalty? In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Negotiate a peace with your brother.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'd have better luck debating the wind.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Please bring my terms to your son.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I believe we are natural allies.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I hope he feels the same.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 No! No.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Follow me! - You'll die for this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - No, wait, it wasn't her! We've got to leave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They'll hang you for this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I won't leave him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You can't avenge him if you're dead.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Over there, go! Not that way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We need to go home.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Loras.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My lord, my lady.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Get out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stannis will be here in an hour.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And you want that privilege for yourself.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There's no time for this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Ride back to Highgarden, sister.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'm not running from Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I don't believe that.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You don't believe that.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Who gained the most from our king's death? Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I will put a sword through his righteous face.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You can't stay here.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He would have been a true king, a good king.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world? Revenge.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You can't avenge him from the grave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Bring the horses.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Please.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He was very handsome.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He was, Your Grace.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 "Your Grace.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 " Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Do you want to be a queen? No.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I want to be the queen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Killed? By whom? Accounts differ.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Really? Who'd have thought? Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Whomever did it, I say well done.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's not what Varys says.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away? She'll be safer in Dorne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It so happens that I am.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So clever.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots? Schemes and plots are the same thing.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They are going to attack us.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We need to be ready.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 No need to concern yourself over it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 May I ask specifically what the king has in mind? You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The answer will be the same.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's important that we talk about this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's wildfire.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin? - No.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - That's a lie right there.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It is not a lie.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Why would I lie? Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'm telling you the truth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The smart money would be on more likely.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 She's making wildfire.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I suppose there's only one way to find out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Please.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 When did she tell you this? I heard her talking with the pyromancer.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I swear to you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Swear to me on what? On my life.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But I don't care about your life.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow All right, all right.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Enough.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Even torturing you is boring.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Just get out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It will be my pleasure.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Your Grace.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What is it? I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Fools love a fool.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Your Grace, I I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You've come to lecture me on truth? I've come to tell you that what I saw All my brother's bannermen have come to my side.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They won't be able to resist us now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron I'll hear no more about it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 When do we sail for King's Landing? As soon as I've consolidated my troops.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you? That's not your concern.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Was I wrong? Loyal service means telling hard truths.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Oh, truth again.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 All right, what's the truth? The hard truth? She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What do you believe? You won those bannermen from Renly.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Don't lose them to her.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The other lords won't be happy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I've got it! I've got it! So it's that one there at the top, on the right.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Buy my fruit, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Fresh fruit.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What do we have? There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Good thing.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'd be out of a job.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What about your father? He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's very busy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Corruption.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Yes! We are swollen, bloated, foul.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's hard to argue with his assessment.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Not after what he did to your birthday present.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The king is a lost cause.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You have to admire his imagination.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's talking about you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What? Demon monkey? People think you're pulling the king's strings.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They blame you for the city's ills.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You don't need to convince me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Demon monkey.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Yeah, come on.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Welcome.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stop.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stop! Your captain commands you to stop! Where are we headed, Captain? The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do yourjobs well.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And who decides if we've done ourjobs well? I do.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Your captain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 All I need is a ship.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you? You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stop.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We yield.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Congratulations on your first command.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Thank you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Kind of you to come see me off.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Oh, I'm not here for you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I was just on my way to Red Harbor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I've got 30 ships.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There's nowhere to put them here.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Too narrow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You'd better get out there.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 That would never happen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 This lot, though Enjoy the Stony Shore.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Come on, I'll take you out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Who are you? Dagmer, your first mate.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages? You're not.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They're all Iron Islanders.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like? The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The seat of the House of Tallhart, - What, you don't think we could take it? - No, we could.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We could never hold it for more than a few days.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And then Take me to my ship.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Starks have overextended their lines.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Starks understand winter better than we ever will.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The cold won't beat them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 This is war, no one's content.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You've been waiting for him to fail.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He is not going to fail, not without our help.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So how do we stop him? We've worked through the night, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Yes, I think you would, Reginald.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My wife's in Lannisport.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Well, then you'd better start riding.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Go! Not wine, water.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We'll be here for some time.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Girl.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Where are you from? Maidenpool, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 House Mooton, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And what is their sigil? A red salmon.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You're a Northerner, aren't you? Good.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 One more time, where are you from? Barrowton, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 House Dustin.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North? They call him the Young Wolf.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And? They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They say he can't be killed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And do you believe them? No, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Anyone can be killed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Fetch that water.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A girl says nothing.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A girl keeps her mouth closed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I was always a girl.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I was always aware.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But the girl keeps secrets.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It is not for a man to spoil them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You're one of them now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I should have let you burn.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And you fetch water for one of them now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Why is this right for you and wrong for me? - I didn't have a choice.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - You did.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I did.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And here we are.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A man pays his debts.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A man owes three.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Three what? The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And only death may pay for life.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You saved me and the two I was with.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You stole three deaths from the Red God.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We have to give them back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Speak three names and the man will do the rest.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I can name anyone and you'll kill him? A man has said.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The one who tortures everyone.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A man needs a name.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I don't know his name.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They call him the Tickler.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 That is enough.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Go now, girl.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Your master is thirsty.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's not here yet.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He'd have seen us, blown the horn.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 When will he come? The Halfhand does things in his own time.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My uncle told me stories about him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Most of them are true.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The whole winter.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Had to wait for the thaw.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Well, possible for the Halfhand.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 About time you did something.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 At least you'll keep warm.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Fist of the First Men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Think of how old this place is.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Before I die, please, stop talking.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What do you think they were like, the First Men? Stupid.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I think they were afraid.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I think they came here to get away from something.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I don't think it worked.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Wildlings? One blast is for rangers returning.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Wildlings is two blasts.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So you got to stand there waiting, wondering.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 One blast for friends, two for foes.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And three for White Walkers.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know? - Well I read it in a book.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Look.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's Qhorin Halfhand.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Aye, we'll live another day.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Hurrah.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Take care, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 " Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It could well be true.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My companion takes issue.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - No offense meant.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Our order does not deal in pig shit.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The substance is fire given form.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 To do what? The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 How much do you have? If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My lord, this man is insulting.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My friend remains unconvinced.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Well, he's not living anymore.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Our present count stands at 7,811.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 This is a shit idea.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You'll be making it for me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Let him sleep, Doreah.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Yes, Khaleesi.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He loves you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I rewove this part of the top.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I fixed the heel on this one.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Thank you, my friend.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It is known.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 May he ride forever through the night lands.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You would look like a real princess in Xaro's She's not a princess.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 She's a Khaleesi.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You should wear it, Khaleesi.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You are their guest.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It would be rude not to.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And you must visit the night market.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It sounds wonderful.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Meereenis think they have a night market.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I will take you there myself.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Please excuse me for a moment.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What are they doing? Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Very soft.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He can chop off as much as we can carry.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Or melt it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Very simple.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Not even when we leave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Why not? Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's not the only thing.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They're quite good at killing the better men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Mother of Dragons.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A demonstration? Take this gem.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Look at it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Into its depths.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So many facets.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Often more than once.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My apologies.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It was customary for me to extend him an invitation.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What is the House of the Undying? It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You watch over her.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Do I know you? I know you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Who are you? I'm no one.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But she is the Mother of Dragons.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 She needs true protectors, now more than ever.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And fire is power.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It looked like Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 To me it just looked like A shadow in the shape of a man.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 In the shape of Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Will you stay there long, my lady? Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 After that, I will leave for Winterfell.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My two youngest need me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I've been away from them for far too long.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I never knew my mother.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'm sorry.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's a bloody business.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What comes after is even harder.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady? You mean to kill Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I swore a vow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But Stannis has a great army around him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I'm as good as any of them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I should never have fled.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Renly's death was no fault of yours.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You served him bravely.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I only held him that once as he was dying.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's gone, Brienne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I do not know your son, my lady.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But I could serve you, if you would have me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You have courage.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 When the time comes, I will not hold you back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Then I am yours, my lady.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And it's not just thieves, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They come down in the night and they kill my sheep.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I have no one to man my flock now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Only me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I can't keep watch all day and all night.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My wife always prayed for more children.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We'll look after them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Thank you, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And may the gods bless you and yours.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stop it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Good.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Hodor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Hodor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Ah! Lord Stark.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Torrhen's Square is under siege.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 How can the Lannisters strike so far north? Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We have to help them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Do you need so many? If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Take the men you need.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Won't take long, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Southerners don't do well up here.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So, what does it mean? Ask your Maester Luwin.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's the one studying books all the time.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I did ask him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Must not mean anything, then.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You're lying.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - You know what it means.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - I never said I didn't.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You didn't give me an honest answer.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 That's not the same as being a liar.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Well, it's not far off.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream? Something bad? Tell me, boy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls It flooded the castle.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Drowned men were floating here, in the yard.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Ser Rodrik was one of them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The sea is hundreds of miles away.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I know.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - It's just a stupid dream.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Osha.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall? They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Where? On that mountain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I don't see very well.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A fire.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There's a fire.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 How many wildlings have joined him? From what we can tell, all of them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They're almost ready to make their move.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Where? - Somewhere safe.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Somewhere south.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Can't just march into their midst.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You saying we should fall back to the Wall? Mance was one of us once.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Now he's one of them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's going to teach them our way of doing things.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So we need to be more like them, do things their way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - And to do that - We need to get rid of those lookouts.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It's not a job for 400 men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I need to move fast and silent.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I've fought and killed a wight.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 How many rangers can say that? He's the one? Aye.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You killed a wight.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 It would be no trouble.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Go on.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you? He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's my advisor, my friend.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Unlikely.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I can almost always tell what a man wants.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And what about what a woman wants? Much more complicated.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You, for example, what do you want? To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Why? Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki? I want them because they're mine by right.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Ah, a conqueror.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you? No.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I come from nothing.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So you wanted more than you had and you took it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You're a conqueror, too.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You're just less ambitious.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Why? I will show you why.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The hardest steel does not make a mark.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They all went home empty-handed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The only thing that can open this door is this key.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And behind the door? And it can all be mine? All? Let us say half.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies Enough to go home.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 All I have to do? Is marry me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 That was a romantic proposal.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I come from nothing.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 See? I have more ambition than you thought.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Robert Baratheon is dead.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 If you cross the sea with an army you bought The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Four false kings destroying the country.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The usurper is dead.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand? The time to strike is now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, - but you must - Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - I only want - What do you want? Tell me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - To see you on the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 - Why? You have a good claim.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A title.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A birthright.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 But you have something more than that.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Someone who can rule and should rule.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 So what would you have me do, as my advisor? Make your own way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Find your own ship.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You only need one.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 And how do I get the ship? I'll find it for you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 A sound ship with a good captain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 I look forward to meeting him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Khaleesi.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You should stand sideface.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Sideface? Sideways.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Why? Smaller target.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Am I fighting someone? You're practicing for a fight.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 You should practice right.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Go and see where he fell from.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Go up the battlement.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Move away.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 Stand back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	 He's dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	I've taken your castle.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Theon? - It's Prince Theon now.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Get up.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You have to get dressed.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I've taken Winterfell.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I took it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm occupying it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Why? - To take the castle.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - You went with Robb.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - And he sent me back to Pyke.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm a Greyjoy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I can't fight for Robb and my father both.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Where's Hodor? - I don't know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Find the halfwit.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Why? - So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I won't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Yes, you will.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I won't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'll never yield.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'll fight you and throw you out.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The castle is mine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But these people are still yours.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 That's what a good lord would do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Think carefully about what you want to say.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Did you hate us the whole time? I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Louder.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Say Prince Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You all know me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Farlen, you be silent.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Listen to your little lord, Farlen.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He has more sense than you do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 All of you should do as he commands.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He claims the North as well by right of conquest.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - You are all his subjects.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Bugger that.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I serve the Starks.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - If you think you can hold the North with it - Shut up! If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, - I will be as good to you as he ever was.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Steady.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not? I am.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Send the ravens.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My Lord Greyjoy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I see you've finally learned how to address your betters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You were here the day I was taken.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm the one who took you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What of it? Let me serve you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Put a spear in my hand again.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Step aside.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why? It's your dream, little lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The ocean has come to swallow this place.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I ain't letting it drown me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You'll all go about your tasks as usual.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - And in a few days' time Greyjoy! We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You were raised here under this roof.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - These people are your people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - They are not my people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 King Robb thought of you as a brother.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My brothers are dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They died fighting Stark men, men like you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Aye, they died fighting a war your father started.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Among them, but not one of them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I was his hostage, taken from my home.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If he were alive to see this He's not.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He's dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Seven Kingdoms are at war.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And Winterfell is mine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You've served this house faithfully, old man.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But keep talking and I'll Take him to the cells.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Lock him up My prince.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You cannot let that stand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He must pay.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 No, he has to pay the iron price.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They'll never respect you while he lives.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death! No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He disrespected me in front of my men.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 That was his decision, not mine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He is worth more to you alive than dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Starks will pay.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Please, Theon, think what you do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Come.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 No! - No! Theon! Rodrik! He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm begging you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Coward.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Stop.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Stop! Stop right now! You don't give commands anymore, little lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Please, stop this.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Please stop him.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Hush now, child.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm off to see your father.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Theon, please.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Any last words, old man? Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Now you are truly lost.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Theon, please don't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Do something! I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it! Ghost, stay with us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Ghost! There goes your pet.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He's not a pet.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 No, you're right, he's not.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You can't tame a wild thing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You can't trust a wild thing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Ghost is different.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - So you think.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And you'll never know them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I said you can't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We could do the same.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 No, we couldn't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 This is their country.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They know where to walk, where not to walk.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My father always said I'm of the North.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I wasn't joking.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Look around, boy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You understand me? No, you don't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We're at war.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We've always been at war.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Watch has given you a great gift.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You only have one thing to give in return, your life.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I'll gladly give my life.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I don't want you to be glad about it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And know this, boy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They'll never know what you've done.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They'll never know how you died.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They won't even know your damn name.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Now, do you understand me? I do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You're even dumber than you look.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Make us feel like we've got a purpose.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Come on.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Can you read? - My lord? Can you read? This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My apologies, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I must have Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It's the one on this My cupbearer can read better than you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance? My lord, I To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I see I overestimated you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Put the book away, girl.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Lord Petyr Baelish.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Mmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Give us the room.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Clear all this.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Lord Tywin.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Baelish.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Wine? - Thank you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What news from the capital? I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Ah, the late King Renly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Rather a short reign.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Murdered by a woman, I hear.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 So they say.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 There has been talk of other forces at work.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Dark forces.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What other brilliant insights have you brought me today? After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, - feeding horses and soldiers.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Yes, yes, yes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Loras wants revenge.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He blames Stannis for Renly's death.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And Margaery Wants to be queen.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Yes, she does.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Against my grandson.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - They did.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 More wine for Lord Baelish.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden? They have.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Pardon, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It's only wine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You would ride there yourself? Tonight, with your leave.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'll have an answer by nightfall.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 That'll be all, girl.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And what else? On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why? He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Hmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - A girl.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - A wildling.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We could question her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You could.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 She won't answer.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - What's your name? - Ygritte.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 She was reaching for this ax when you got to her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I gave you my name.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm Jon Snow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You ought to burn them you killed.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'd need a big fire for that.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Tell me, Ygritte.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area? Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Our boy here's already killed one dead man.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He can do it again if he has to.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What waits beyond the pass? - The free folk.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - How many? Hundreds and thousands.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 More than you've ever seen, crow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want? Do you mean to march on the Wall? Do you know who I am, girl? Qhorin Halfhand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Tell me true.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner? They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If not, they'd kill you slow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We have no food for her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Can't spare a man to watch her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Can't let her go.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - It needs to be done.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Want me to do it? No.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 No, I'll do it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Come, brothers.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'll leave him to it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'll meet you at the top.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Don't take too long.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We're deep in their country now.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Mance would take you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I know he would.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 There's secret ways.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The crows would never catch us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm as much a crow as they are.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Will you burn me? After? Can't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Someone might see the smoke.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 That's cold.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Go on.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Be quick about it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Do it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Bastard, do it! You can't do it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We both know it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The sun's going down, Jon Snow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And your friends are nowhere close.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'll find them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Call for them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Go on.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Call loudly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 May the Seven guide the princess on herjourney.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 May the Mother give her health.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 May the crone give her wisdom.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 May the warrior give her courage.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 One day I pray you love someone.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I want that for you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Before I take her from you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Princes don't cry.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I saw you cry.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Did you say something, my lady? My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 So? It seems a normal thing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Is your little brother a prince? No.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Murderer! Bastard! All hail the King.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He's no king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He's a bastard! Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Freak.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Yes, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Come, quickly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Please, Your Grace, give us some food! Bread, Your Grace, please! Who threw that? I want the man who threw that.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Find who did that and bring him to me! Hold on! Hold them back! Just kill them! Kill them all! - Move.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Move! Pull back! Tear him to pieces! What are you doing? I want these people executed! And they want the same for you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Where's Sansa? Through the door.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Come on.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Push hard.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Protect the king! - Get back! - Fall back! Keep him safe! Brotherfucker! - Watch out.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Hold them back.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Hey.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Traitors! - I'll have all their heads.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - You blind, bloody fool.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You can't insult me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - You can't - I can, I am.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They attacked me! They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 All because of a war you started.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You're talking to a king! And now I've struck a king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? Let them have her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You owe him quite a bit, you know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Where are you going? You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I take my orders from the king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Where? This way.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Please! No! No! Please! You're all right now, little bird.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You're all right.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'll get you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'll get you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 This way.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Are you hurt, my lady? The little bird's bleeding.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Someone take her back to her cage.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - See to that cut.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Well done, Clegane.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I didn't do it for you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He shouldn't make me wait.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He makes everyone wait.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I already have a husband.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Mother of Dragons! Here he comes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Forgive me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I had terrible dreams last night.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Terrible dreams.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The silver hair of a true Targaryen.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Thank you, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 So, my little princess, what is it you want? My birthright.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I cannot give you what I do not have.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm asking you for ships.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I need to cross the Narrow Sea.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I need my ships as well.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne? My father sat there, before he was murdered.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say "take the Iron Throne"? I didn't come here to argue grammar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Of course not.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You came to take my ships.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 So let me explain my position, little princess.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I make my living by trade.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And I judge every trade on its merits.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You ask for ships.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You say I shall be repaid triple.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Do you have an army? - Not yet.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You do not have an army.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Do you have powerful allies in Westeros? There are many there that support my claim.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 When were you there last? I left when I was a baby.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 So, in truth, you have no allies.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Ah.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Now if you'll pardon me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 A shrewd man.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My dreams come true.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I admire your passion.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm sorry, little princess.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I am not your little princess.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 With fire and blood, I will take it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Who taught you to read? My father, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Hmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I taught my son Jaime to read.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He couldn't make sense of the letters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He reversed them in his head.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He hated me for it, for a time.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 For a long time.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But he learned.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Hmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he? A stonemason.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He taught himself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Quite a man.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What killed him? Loyalty.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You're a sharp little thing, aren't you? Did Forgive me, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I shouldn't ask questions.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 No.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But you've already begun.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Did you know your father, my lord? I did.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I grew up with him.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I watched him grow old.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He loved us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He was a good man, but a weak man.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm cold.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Mmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Where are you going, girl? The armory, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Why? - Lord Tywin sent me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What might this be? Lord Tywin gave it to me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What for? To take to the armory.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Move! Get out of the way! Amory Lorch.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 A girl has named a second name.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 A man will do what must be done.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Now! A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But he's going to tell Tywin.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He's getting away.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It has to be now.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Guard! - Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My honor, Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Quent.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Lady Talisa.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm not sure I'm a lady.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It's hard to keep all the rules straight.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Unless she's a queen or a princess.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I could find someone who knows.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth? Because it's obvious.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop? I'd call you a liar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Better at amputations, I'm afraid.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Quite a pretty spot.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Will we be here long? I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm not a spy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You're right.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You've found me out.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 "The young wolf is on the move.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 " Perhaps you'd join me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If you've got time, of course, for, well Robb.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Mother.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Mother, this is Lady Talisa.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 She's been helping with the wounded.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 She's been very helpful.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Lady Talisa.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Lady Stark.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Lady Talisa - Maegyr.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 An uncommon name here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 An old name in Volantis.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Excuse me, my lady.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I've missed you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Yes, you look positively forlorn.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You surprised me, that's all.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I didn't think I'd see you today.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You have inherited your father's responsibilities.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm afraid they come at a cost.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - You are promised to another.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 A debt that must be paid.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I haven't forgotten.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My lady.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 News from Winterfell.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'll stop here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Too dark to go any farther today.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Here? There's no shelter here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 There's no shelter anywhere.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 There is if you know where to look.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The cold could kill us both.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - If you light a fire - No fire.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - But a fire is - No fire.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Have it your way.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Bet you freeze to death before I do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Bet your life.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Think they're out looking for you? - Yes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Think they'll find you? Yes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You're brave.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Stupid, but brave.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We start again at first light.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Get some sleep.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Stop moving.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm just trying to get comfortable.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Stop it! - You're still moving.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Was I? I didn't notice that time.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 This cannot be true.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm afraid it is true.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why? Why would Theon Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - My brothers? - We've heard nothing of them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I told you, never trust a Greyjoy! I must go north at once.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 There's still a war to win, Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? - How can I ask men to follow me if I can't - You are a king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Let me go and talk to Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 There will be no talk.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He will die for this.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 We have the Lannisters on the run.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And then I'll take his head myself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you? I'm no liar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I done what I had to do to stay alive.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I hate the Starks as well as you do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Let me serve you, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 There are other ways to serve, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I'm a prince now, and you'd do well - There are other ways to serve, my prince.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Like what? We know things, the free people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt? Other things.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Savage things.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Wait outside.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I always wondered what you had under there.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It comes at a price.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I'm not killing you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 That's your price.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I already had that.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 What do you want then, other than your miserable life? What all free people want.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 My freedom.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Well, you shall have it, then.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 But only if you serve me well.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Ow! - Shh.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - It's not deep.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - I thought they were going to kill me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 They thought so, too.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He hated me, the man who hit me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I saw it in his eyes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Hated me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Of course he did.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - Why? Why would a stranger You are everything he will never have.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Your horse eats better than his children.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 It doesn't matter now.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He's dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I would have given them bread if I had it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I hate the king more than any of them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Don't say these things.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If the wrong people hear you But you're not the wrong people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Don't trust anybody.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Life is safer that way.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And where are you going? I have something for you from Prince Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 - What? - Me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 He says I'm to make the rounds.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And keep you warm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? When I came to this city, I had nothing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Truly nothing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 I slept by the docks.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 If not, I dreamed of food.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 And here I am, with no regrets.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Bar the gates.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Ring the bells.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Slowly, Khaleesi.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	 Where are they? Where are my dragons?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you? The giant must have took him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And Rickon, too? The little one? Gone, along with the wildling woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The one you were fucking.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Right.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Get the horses and the hounds.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come on, find the scent.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Where they going? Halt! Enjoying your first hunt? So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 With hunting, there's blood at the end.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 They're little boys.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 So I kept my word.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I never ran away.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 They have no value to me missing.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Robb's in the Riverlands.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My sister's in Deepwood Motte.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She'll get here long before they do.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And Ned Stark always said We have a scent! The hounds have the scent.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come, Maester, don't look so grim.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's all just a game.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We should have took more food.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Those people all love you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 They would have given you whatever you needed.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - The boy can't survive on walnuts.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - I'm fine.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We've been walking since before sunrise.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Even Hodor will tire.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Hodor.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Even you, sweet giant.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Hodor.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Wait, I know that farm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Jack and Billy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - They'll give us some food.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - We can't risk it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 They'll be after us with hounds.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Did you pull a knife on me in the night? What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Let's move.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It is the first time.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 How old are you, boy? I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're a boy who's never been with a girl.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets Don't call them that.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What, stones? Or bone? Neither.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Both.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Move! I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 As if I'd feel sorry for them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Are there no girl crows? There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 So the lads just do it with each other? No.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Never? - Never.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We swore an oath.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Would you please shut up? - Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - I'm a free woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - You're a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's what "prisoner" means.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It was my choice to say the words.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - So you don't like girls? - Of course I like girls.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But you chose never to touch them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy! They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My father was Ned Stark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I have the blood of the First Men.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My ancestors lived here, same as yours.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 So why are you fighting us? Go on.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Now I want you to tell me what happened.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come on, this way.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come on, speak up.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Speak up.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Wolfsbane.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A rare substance.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 This is no common assassin.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We hanged 20 men last night.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I don't care if you hanged 100.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A man tried to kill me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I want his name and I want his head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We look like fools and they look like heroes.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's how kings fall.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I want them dead, every one.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Killing them isn't the problem.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's finding them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Burn the villages, burn the farms.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Mmm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Is that mutton? Yes, my lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Don't like mutton.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - I'll bring something else.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Leave it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Are you hungry? - No.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Of course you are.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Eat.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'll eat in the kitchen later.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Sit.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Eat.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're small for your age.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I eat a lot.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I just don't grow.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Mmm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 This will be my last war.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Win or lose.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Have you ever lost before? Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war? But this is the one I'll be remembered for.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The War of Five Kings, they're calling it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My legacy will be determined in the coming months.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's what remains of you when you're gone.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The greatest fortress ever built.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The tallest towers, the strongest walls.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The Great Hall had 35 hearths.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Thirty-five.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Can you imagine? Look at it now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A blasted ruin.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Do you know what happened? Dragons? Yes.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Dragons happened.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's why every child alive still knows his name Aegon and his sisters.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Mmm? It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Correct.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A student of history, are you? Rhaenys rode Meraxes.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Visenya rode Vhagar.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Hmm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She's a heroine of yours, I take it? Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair? Most girls are idiots.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You remind me of my daughter.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword? From my father.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He was a well-read stonemason.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Have you met many stonemasons, my lord? Careful now, girl.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I enjoy you, but be careful.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Take that back to the kitchen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Eat what you want.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And, girl.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "M'lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 " Lowborn girls say "m'lord," not "my lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 " If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She taught me how to speak proper Properly.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're too smart for your own good.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Has anyone told you that? Yes.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Go on.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I beg pardon, ser.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - You were so brave.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Does it give you joy to scare people? No, it gives me joy to kill people.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Spare me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It was his duty.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He never liked it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Is that what he told you? He lied.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Why are you always so hateful? You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 One of them did this or knows who did.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You are one of the Thirteen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - They mean nothing to me on their own.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 There is no we, so why would you help me get them back? I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A man is what others say he is and no more.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But it did happen under your roof.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been I don't care where you've been.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You could be free, too.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Wake up when you want to wake up.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're a pretty lad.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Walk.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I could teach you how to do it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I know how to do it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And what did she say? She admired your spirit, Your Grace.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And what then? She If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You've acted with honor.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I thank you for it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Too many prisoners.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Is there room for Ser Alton? Does he need to lie down? Have the men build him a new pen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Have your boy watch over them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Torrhen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That will be all.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Your Grace.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A minute of your time? I've been treating your wounded men.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 They're not my enemies.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's what I tell my bannermen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I've already run through the supplies I brought with me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Some are easily replaced.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But some are not.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I need silk for stitching.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Mostly I need milk of the poppy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - If you need help finding these - I know where to find them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Continue, my lady.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender? Yes.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I expect he will.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If I could write a list.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come with me to the Crag.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I don't think that will be Let the maester show you his stores.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Children, come inside, quick.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come on.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Hurry up! Can't find anything, ser.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - They've lost the scent.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Try again.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We've circled this farmhouse twice.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 There's no sign of them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'll beat them until they do.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Prince Theon.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Where are they? - Who, m'lord? The Stark boys.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Where are they? I don't know.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I seen no one.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Think harder.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I swear, m'lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I don't know.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My lord, over here.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I think I've found what we're looking for.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Send the old man home.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Go back to Winterfell.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Take him back.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Theon, don't do this.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - You came back.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - As soon as I heard.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Do you know anything? - Irri is dead.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - I know.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - She was a good - She's dead.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She died alone.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Doreah? We can't find her.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She must be dead, too.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I should have been here.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You went to find me a ship.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My place is by your side.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "These people"? They are not to be trusted.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Your people are in Westeros.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - They will soon enough.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You are not your brother.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Trust me, Khaleesi.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 There it is.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "Trust me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 " And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I don't want it and I don't have room for it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - You are too young to be so - And you are too familiar.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Forgive me, Khaleesi.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No one can survive in this world without help.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No one.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Let me help you, please.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Tell me how.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Find my dragons.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 How long till we get back to your crows? We're close.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? - Do you even know where they are? - We're close.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me? Nothing happened between you and me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, "we were only close together for warmth.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "And before I knew what was where, his his "Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! "And he spread me legs and ruined.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "The shame of it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "What will me poor savage father say?" Turn back around.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "And I thought that we were done, but he said, "'Turn back around.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "' I'll tell you what, Jon Snow.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just What, right here in the muck? I'll keep you warm enough.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Are you that afraid of it? That's enough.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's nice and wet and warm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Enough! It don't have teeth.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 All right! All right.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Gods, you're dull.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Should have took me while you had the chance.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No, no! No.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Oh, no.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's all right.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Give me that.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Help me flip it over.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Where are you going? - To tell Her Grace.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You'll say nothing to anyone.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Do you understand? Your mother might have prepared you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You flowered, my dear.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No more.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 In what way? I thought it would be less Less messy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Wait until you birth a child.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're a woman now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Do you have any idea what that means? I'm fit to bear children for the king? A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Joffrey has always been difficult.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You cannot imagine the pain.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 His Grace was not with you? Robert was hunting.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That was his custom.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Not that I wanted him there, mind you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Joffrey will show you no such devotion.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You may never love the king, but you will love his children.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I love His Grace with all my heart.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's so very touching to hear.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The more people you love, the weaker you are.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Love no one but your children.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 On that front, a mother has no choice.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace? You can try, little dove.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Who did you say your mother was again? Cinda Lannister.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Is she the fat one? Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she No, no.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 There's only one fat Lannister.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If she was your mother, you'd know it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I squired for you once, you know.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 When? The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I went to Willem Frey's wedding? You did.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What was his name? Bryan.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Poor lad.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I remember you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You'd never squired for anyone before.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's right.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I ran up and volunteered.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "Let me, my lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Let me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 " My father was furious.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You didn't, though.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You really remember? You knew when you were needed and when to go away.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's a rare talent.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - When I think back to that day - Shh! You were saying? I Never mind.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's embarrassing.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit? I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'll remember it all until I die.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That was the best day of my life.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And I remember being on the field after it was over.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 All the competitors were done.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I was the last one out there.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And I couldn't leave.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I understand completely.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's just that I I was 16 once.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Which knight was it? Barristan Selmy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Before your time.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What was he like? He was A painter.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A painter who only used red.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's hard to put into words.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Did you squire for him again? - No.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I didn't have your gift.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He couldn't take a step without stepping on me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I was awful, a complete liability.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's a good thing I am who I am.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'd have been useless at anything else.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Shocking, I know.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Some men are.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Not me, though.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And have you thought about Of course.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Every day.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And? Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The Starks are very careful.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But there is a way, I think.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It wasn't possible until now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What is it? - It's actually quite simple.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Well, let me help you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You'll only have to do one thing.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Tell me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You'll have to die.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Jorah the Andal.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 This man must sail past old Valyria.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I didn't come here for lessons.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No, you came for the dragons.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You have them? Where are they? Draw your sword.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 See what your steel is worth.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You love her.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Where are the dragons? Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal? Will you betray her again? Never.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The thief you seek is with her now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No one is calling you a thief.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Who is she to accuse us? Please, they're my children.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'm begging you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Without me, the dragons will die.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It will be for the best.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You are cruel, my friend.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The Mother of Dragons is in the right.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She must be reunited with her babies.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - I will help you, Khaleesi.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - How? I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You have my dragons? When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He procured them for me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But there is no King of Qarth.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 There is now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That was the other half of the arrangement.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Your ambition is an inspiration.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But like all upstarts, you overreach.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 A mother should be with her children.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come see them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Lady Stark! - No farther.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Keep your hands off me, woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Don't enter without an invitation, man.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Forgive me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Lady Stark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What is it? - They caught the Kingslayer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Kingslayer! - Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him! - Hang him! You'll die today.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Justice for the Karstark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Gut him! Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 This monster killed my son.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And crippled mine.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I will have his head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And if you try and stop me You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I am the mother of your king! - And where is our king now? - You know very well.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - He brought that foreign bitch with him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - How dare you! - Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters? I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Wise men do not make demands of kings.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Fathers who love their sons do.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I will have his head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I would have come to your defense, but Take him to the stockades.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Bind him with every chain you can find! You've become a real she-wolf in your later years.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 There's not much fish left in you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And gag him! Since when do you light your own candles? Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 How many times can you read one raven scroll? Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - More than we have.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Yes, that's more than we have.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We have strong, high walls.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 We'll rain fire down on them from above.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 "Rain fire on them from above.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 " You're quoting Father, aren't you? Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he? Call it tactics, not strategy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The best mind, some would say.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Sadly, he's not here.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He needs to start acting like a king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 This war you started is coming to our doorstep.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I thought the girls might help him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Did you? - I was wrong.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 If we can't control him Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He looks like him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 In a certain light.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Sometimes I wonder.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Sins? The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? "Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 " You've beaten the odds.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Then why wait? We're sworn to the king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - There's not a king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - That's treason.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 So is saving Lannisters, yeah? - Back off, you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - No, I won't.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Your son returns at dawn, my lady? So they say.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The Kingslayer won't last the night.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister? Come.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 He'll not be making it through the night.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I need to be alone with him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - My lady, our orders - Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Is that a woman? Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You strangled his son with your chains.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Oh.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Oh.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Any knight would have done the same.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - You are no knight.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 So many vows.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 They make you swear and swear.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Where did you find this beast? She is a truer knight than you will ever be, - Kingslayer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - Kingslayer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What a king he was.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You are a man without honor.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What was the name of that bastard he fathered? - Brienne.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 - No, that wasn't it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Snow, a bastard from the North.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're not very good at pretending.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You're an honest woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 Your sword.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I told you what would happen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 All of you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 I told you what would happen if you served me loyally.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 And what would happen if you did not.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 What are you doing? What have you done? If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	 No!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	- Riders approaching! - Open the gate! Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Envy isn't attractive.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - What envy? You should be proud of your brother's achievement.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're a great warrior.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I saw the bodies above your gates.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old? I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You treated them with honor? By butchering them? Before I had to kill them, - I treated them - You seized their home, as is your right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We're ironborn, we take what we need.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Exactly.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - They made me a promise - Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive? - Don't call me - A cunt.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You know how valuable those boys were? If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You are weak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you're stupid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm warning you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Go on, then.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Warn me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You haven't brought enough men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot? You're not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I've come to bring you home.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Father wants a word.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We're islanders, baby brother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - When Robb Stark finds out - He won't find out.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We've killed all the ravens.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We have all the horses.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I've taken Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And I will keep Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Leave us.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Theon, you're my blood.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We both loved our mother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We both endured our father.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Come home with me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Don't die here alone.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I don't intend to die.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I wanted to strangle you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You smiled at me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Don't die so far from the sea.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I already got one crow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Don't need two.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Mance will want to question this one.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Halfhand knows more.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 This one is just a little boy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Gut him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He could have killed me half a dozen times.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And now he wishes he did.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Gut him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Mance will want him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard? I don't know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I think he'll want to decide for himself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He runs, I'll chop his balls off.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He runs, I'll do it meself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We're even now, Jon Snow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I couldn't do it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't I know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The others? When you didn't come back, we went looking for you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We found your tracks fast enough.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But they found us before we found you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They died because of me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 See that it wasn't for nothing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 All right, up, lad.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Come on, on your feet, now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Move it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Is she beautiful? I've never met her.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What's her name? Frey, I suppose.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I don't know her first name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sure you'll be very happy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you're marrying her for a bridge? - An important bridge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Ah.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It was before they killed my father.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He was the best man I ever met.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I know children always think that about their fathers, but Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The soldiers you order into battle.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I didn't believe him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I asked him, "How can a man be brave if he's afraid?" "That is the only time a man can be brave," he told me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I wish I could have met him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He would have liked you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - He didn't care much about gold or glory.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I want the men following me to go home.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Then why don't you? Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And because I believe in justice.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - That would be a start.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Your Grace, milady.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 How? Tell me this isn't true.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Why? For the girls.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - You betrayed me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Robb No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I have five children, and only one of them is free.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I lost one son fighting by your son's side.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I grieve for your sons, my lord.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I don't want your grief.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I want my vengeance.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you stole it from me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You've weakened our position.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You've brought discord into our camp.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you did it all behind my back.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Make sure she's guarded day and night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Robb.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer? Forty, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Send another 40 with our fastest horses.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Robb.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Damn.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're much uglier in daylight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Brienne of Tarth.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Crescent moons and starbursts.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Lord Selwyn Tarth.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Your father.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Might as well get to know one another.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Have you known many men? I suppose not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Women? Horses? Ah.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Forgive me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you? You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly? You will not provoke me to anger.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I already have.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Look at you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're ready to chop my head off.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight? I've never seen you fight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The answer is no.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're not one of them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 All my life men like you have sneered at me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Let's see what happens.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Do you take me for an idiot? In! I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Woman of honor.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Was I wrong? You're afraid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Surrender the Iron Throne? Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Stannis will execute them all.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 No, a king who runs will not be king for long.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's a Lannister.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He'll stand and fight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north ofAshemark.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Which is why my son is his prisoner.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Too close to Casterly Rock.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We'll ride at nightfall.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Track down this brotherhood and destroy them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The girl has proven herself a good servant.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 She'll stay on with you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You've got some questions to answer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Who killed Ser Amory? I don't know! Please! Give me the name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Take this one out for the crows.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I told you, I don't know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Please.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Where's Jaqen? Don't care.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Come on, time to kill some wolves.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You need sour cherries to make it right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 That's where the real flavor is.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You crush 'em up real fine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Where's Jaqen? - How would I know? - I need him now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - You need him? He's helping me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I saw him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Where? - Where? Where? - Ow! They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 On patrol.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Let go of my ears.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What do you want with him anyway? Mance is gonna march on the Wall.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - They'll never trust me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - They might.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - If you do what needs to be done.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - What? How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl? - I didn't.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's not yours to kill, crow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Do you have to do that here? I like to keep me hands clean.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Yes, but do you have to do it here? You should start wearing the gold cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're commander of the City Watch.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - You shouldn't be dressed like a common - A cloak slows you down in a fight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Makes it hard to move quietly.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're supposed to stand out.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Fine, fine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 No gold cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What? - What? - What? What? Why are you staring at me? You don't want me cleaning me nails.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You don't want me looking your way.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Why am I here? To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Stannis will be here any day.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And one of these explains how to beat him? "An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 " By Archmaester Shevelathin.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Shevelatesh.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Chevalteesh.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My Lord Hand.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Commander.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery? I did not know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery? Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 For questioning? No.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - We talked about this.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Aye, we talked about it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 See, it's not the fighting that kills most people.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It's the starving.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Food's worth more than gold.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The thieves, they love a siege.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Ah.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 "The Great Sieges of Westeros.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 " Thrilling subject.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Stannis knows King's Landing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Mud Gate.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 That's where he'll land.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan? We could throw books at his men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We don't have that many books.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We don't have that many men, either.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What do we have? Pig shit.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I can't imagine anything much worse.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You lack imagination.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Where do you think Jon is right now? He went off with the Halfhand.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He didn't come back.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A betting man would go with dead.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's not dead.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 No, Jon's a great fighter.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 So did his father.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Great rangers never get old is the problem.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Shit ones neither.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It's them in the middle that last a long time.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What in seven hells is that? The First Men made these marks.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Help me with it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Look.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 That's a Night's Watch cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It's been here a long time.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Oh.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Must be dragonglass.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Dragonglass? The maesters call it obsidian.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Why would a brother hide it here? I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Mind where you're going.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sorry.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'll Where were you? A man has patrol duty.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A girl owes one more name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Red God demands it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Give the man a name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone? A minute, an hour, a month.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Death is certain, the time is not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's taking his army to attack my brother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I need him dead right now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 This a man cannot do.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You promised you'd help me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Help was not promised, lovely girl.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Only death.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 There must be others.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Give a name, any name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you'll kill them? Anybody? By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 All right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Jaqen H'ghar.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A girl gives a man his own name? - That's right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Gods are not mocked.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - This is no joking thing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I'm not joking.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A man can go kill himself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Un-name me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - No.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Please? I'll un-name you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Thank you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - If you help me and my friends escape.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 This would require more than one life.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - This is not part of our bargain.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A girl lacks honor.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If I do this thing, a girl must obey.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A girl will obey.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Thank you, Podrick.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Odd little boy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You and Varys both.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Excellent lamprey pie.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 An inspiration for the troops.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's only a boy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Younger boys are off fighting his war.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - He's not ready.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - What is he, 17? - Remember Jaime at 17? - Better than you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 His place is not on the battlefield.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Do you think I'm an idiot? No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You shipped off my only daughter.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He has the finest armor gold can buy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He needs to be out there.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Any dessert? Do you know why Varys is so dangerous? Because he has thousands of spies in his employ.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Because he doesn't have a cock.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Neither do you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It's not that little.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Why are you smiling? Because I'm happy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And why are you happy? Because I have your little whore.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I thought you preferred blondes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Such a droll little fellow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Father will be so pleased.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Why do you care who I fuck? Because a Lannister always pays her debts.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 This is madness.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Stannis will be here in days.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - You need me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Lovely body.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The bruises will heal in time.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Where did you find her? Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Oh? Well, you're the expert.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Tell me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You don't buy them, you only rent them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're usually a better liar, baby brother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 This one you like.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You like her very much.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Unless Joffrey is hurt.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And how do I know you haven't killed her already? Would you like to see her? I thought you might.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sorry they hurt you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You must be brave.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I promise I will free you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Don't forget me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Never.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I will hurt you for this.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you will know the debt is paid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Get out.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Shae! I've been waiting all night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What is wrong? You're beautiful.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then why do you look sad? We have to be more careful.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Don't be afraid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I can take care of myself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 There are people who want to hurt me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I won't let them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'll cut off their faces.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I will.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I would kill for you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're mine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm yours.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Promise me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm yours, and you are mine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Still no word? We've sent a dozen ravens.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 None have returned.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Once he captures the castle - Theon has my brothers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - If we storm the castle - He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Send word to your son.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Too much Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He betrayed our cause.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He betrayed me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Your pardon, my lord.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My lady.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 How are you? How am I? I've had to arrest my mother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Lannisters have my sisters.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sorry.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 It was a stupid question.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sorry.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 No.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Forgive me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're being kind.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I have no right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - You have every right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're a king.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 That's not the kind of king I want to be.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What kind do you want to be? I don't know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The good kind.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Most kings grew up as princes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'd like to hear you play the harp.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 No.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 No, you would not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet? When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And they left me with my little brother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The rich, the poor, we were all there.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I called his name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then I started screaming his name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And then I saw him floating face down.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My heart just stopped.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I was I dragged him from the water.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My friend helped me, I think.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I don't even remember.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He was so little.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And I screamed at him and I shook him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And he was dead.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Just dead.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A man ran over.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He had a fish tattoo on his face.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 So you know what they are without having to talk to them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And this man worked on a fishing boat.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And he pushed me out of the way.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I decided two things that day.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sorry, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I don't want you to marry her.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But you needed that bridge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Shut up.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Probably in the piecrust by now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 In the oven.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The nice, warm oven.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Shut up.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What did you bring? The cheese could be better.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I did get some nice sausages.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What did he want us to do about those guards? He didn't say.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He just said, "Walk through the gates.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 " What about the guards? He didn't say anything about the guards.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think? We have to trust him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I want to go back to the kitchens.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Shut up.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Stay here if you're afraid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Arry, don't.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Away! Reset! If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Will it hold? Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Again, pull! I admire you, Ser Davos.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I thank you, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Pleased to hear it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My son wishes me to change it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Three mermen with tridents, something like that.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I understand why the older families look down at me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Do you? Why? - My father was a crabber.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - And? Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Our hands stink.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And where were those lords when Storm's End starved? Many fought bravely for your brother.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Many fought for the Mad King.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Some are happy to do it to my face.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We were forgotten.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with 500 men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - No? Robert did.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Renly never fought a day in his life.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - He was only a boy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - Then why'd he give him Storm's End? First, we ate the horses.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then the cats.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Never liked cats.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 So fine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I do like dogs.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Good animals.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Loyal.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But we ate them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then the rats.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And then you made it through the lines.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And potatoes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Some salted beef, I believe.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I was relieved they did not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Insult or no, I gave it up.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're the Master of Whisperers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're supposed to know everything.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 No man can be in all rooms at all times.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Stark forces are distracted.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Now is the time to strike.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way? If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A brave choice, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sure your men will line up behind you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They say Stannis never smiles.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Imagine Stannis' terror.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I am trying.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're an intelligent man.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I wish we could, too.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What do you want? Tell me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If we're going to play, you'll have to start.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 My sister became queen at the age of 19.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A most highborn plumber.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The water never flowed better.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And all the shit found its way to the sea.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I never expected to have any real power.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 So when my father named me acting Hand You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Honorable men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But they disdained the game and those who played.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - You enjoy the game.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - I do.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Last thing I expected.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And you play it well.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'd like to keep playing it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine? In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We should sail there immediately.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Daenerys Targaryen lives.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 She has three dragons.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And then there will be nowhere to hide.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 One game at a time, my friend.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Careful, Khaleesi.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I found one.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A ship with a good captain.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Astapor? We cannot stay here.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They have my dragons.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 A mother does not flee without her children.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They're not your children.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They didn't suckle at your breast.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They are dragons, Khaleesi.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You should sail to Astapor.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sure you'll be safe there.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You know I would die for you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I will never abandon you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Then serve me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 That's what the warlock wants.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He told you so himself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If you enter that place, you will never leave again.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - His magic is strong.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You watched the witch burn.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 What did the flames do to me? Do you remember? Until my last breath, I will remember.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 After I have forgotten my mother's face.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They are my children.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 And they are the only children I will ever have.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Take me to them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 We should bury them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Sends a message.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 As you say.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 - What's this? - Gold for the farmer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 For his trouble.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 His troubles are done.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He's feeding the crops now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 His wife, too.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Got as far as the farm and then doubled back.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 You're right so far.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Who was that out there hung up at the gates? Must have been the farmer's boys.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords? They mustn't know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 Bran would blame himself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 They'll never hear it from me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	 The little lads have suffered enough.
s02e09	Blackwater	That's it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The tide's against us.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Aye, but we have the wind.
s02e09	Blackwater	 She'll blow us straight to the gates.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You're coming home.
s02e09	Blackwater	 King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And now I'm sailing right at them.
s02e09	Blackwater	 This is the royal fleet.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Not after tonight.
s02e09	Blackwater	 When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Gods be good.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - God.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Father, there is only one and he watches over us.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - But not over them? - Over all of us.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They will be glad to see his head on a spike.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Well, first, we have to put it there.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I have faith in the Lord of Light.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I have faith in our cause.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And I have faith in my captain.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Are you afraid, my lion? If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Of course I'm afraid.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I won't let them hurt you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm a Lannister.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I don't have a choice in all this.
s02e09	Blackwater	 But it's not your war.
s02e09	Blackwater	 It is now.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You can't fuck your way out of everything.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I have so far.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
s02e09	Blackwater	 As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your words are always wise and measured.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I remember back in the days of King You brought me something? Yes.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious.
s02e09	Blackwater	 A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Ten drops, however I know what ten drops will bring.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your Grace, if I may ask You may not.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You must have a lot of work to do.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Yes.
s02e09	Blackwater	 A siege is very Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
s02e09	Blackwater	 There are so many.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o'er his halls With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls And not a soul to hear - Good boys! - Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song? Drunk Lannisters.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You've got a pretty voice.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Thank you very much.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And I like your nose.
s02e09	Blackwater	 How many times you break it? Well, now let's see.
s02e09	Blackwater	 First time, I was five.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Oh.
s02e09	Blackwater	 It wasn't me she was aiming at.
s02e09	Blackwater	 She was trying for my little brother.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Now he was a real pest.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Second time, I was nine.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Got in a scrap with a few older boys.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They won.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Third time Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Poor nose.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Don't feel sorry for him.
s02e09	Blackwater	 He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Welcome, friends.
s02e09	Blackwater	 This round's on me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I don't think he likes me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You think you're a hard man? I know it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 It's warm in here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 We've got beautiful women and good brown ale.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Plenty for everyone.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Oh, there's women in the ground.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I put some there myself.
s02e09	Blackwater	 So have you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You like fucking and drinking and singing.
s02e09	Blackwater	 But killing, killing's the thing you love.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You're just like me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Only smaller.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And quicker.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Eh? Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Aye I expect he will someday.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Here we are.
s02e09	Blackwater	 One more drink before the war? Shall we? I've always hated the bells.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They ring for horror.
s02e09	Blackwater	 A dead king, a city under siege.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - A wedding.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Exactly.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Podrick, is that it? "Is that it?" Nice touch.
s02e09	Blackwater	 As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Do you trust him? Oddly enough, I do.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Good.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The map you asked for.
s02e09	Blackwater	 There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Closer to 50.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm not escaping.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.
s02e09	Blackwater	 That is good to hear.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You look well suited for battle, my lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Well, I'm not.
s02e09	Blackwater	 For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.
s02e09	Blackwater	 My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What of it? You don't believe in the old powers, my lord? Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What do you think? I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You probably don't entirely trust me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Mmm, don't take it personally.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I don't entirely trust myself.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.
s02e09	Blackwater	 No, I don't believe you have.
s02e09	Blackwater	 One day, I will.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door.
s02e09	Blackwater	 For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They're welcoming the new king.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I've never known bells to mean surrender.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They want to play music with us? Let's play.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Drums.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Drums! Remember, wait till the ships The ships are in the bay.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - They must be far enough in - I know what "in" means.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Do you know how to use that? - I chopped wood once.
s02e09	Blackwater	 No, I watched my brother chopping wood.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I saw you kill a man with a shield.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Don't get killed.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Nor you, my friend.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Oh, are we friends now? - Of course we are.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Enhances it, really.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Oh! "Enhances.
s02e09	Blackwater	 " Fancy word for a sellsword.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Been spending time with fancy folks.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Lady Sansa and Sheila.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Shae.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Shae, yes.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.
s02e09	Blackwater	 She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Sansa.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Always been a great romantic, my nephew.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Sansa, come here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I will pray for your safe return, my lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Will you? - Just as I pray for the king's.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stay safe, my lady.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And you, my lion.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your king rides forth to battle.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You should see him off with a kiss.
s02e09	Blackwater	 My new blade.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Hearteater, I've named it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Kiss it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Will you slay him yourself? If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard? A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm sorry, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You're right, I'm stupid.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Of course you'll be in the vanguard.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And he is only a pretender.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your brother's turn will come.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Some of those boys will never come back.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Joffrey will.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - The worst ones always live.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Shh.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Come, my lady.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Where's our fleet? On the way.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The king has asked you a question.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.
s02e09	Blackwater	 That would make me the quarterman.
s02e09	Blackwater	 It just doesn't have the same ring to it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal.
s02e09	Blackwater	 No signal, no plan.
s02e09	Blackwater	 No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere.
s02e09	Blackwater	 It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Where are their ships? It was wise to attack at night.
s02e09	Blackwater	 We took them by surprise.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago.
s02e09	Blackwater	 There are no surprises here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Maybe.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I don't know why she wants me here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 She's always saying how stupid I am.
s02e09	Blackwater	 She hates me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I doubt it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Maybe she's jealous of you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Why would she be jealous? Sansa.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I was wondering where our little dove had flown.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You look pale, child.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Is your red flower still blooming? Yes.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 So? I didn't offer you water.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What's he doing here? Ser llyn? He's here to defend us.
s02e09	Blackwater	 When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.
s02e09	Blackwater	 But we have guards to defend us.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Guards we have paid.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The battle's first traitors.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Have Ser llyn see to them.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You said he was here to protect us.
s02e09	Blackwater	 He is.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Traitors are a danger to us all.
s02e09	Blackwater	 More wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	 There they are.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Archers to their marks.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Archers, to your marks! Archers! Nock your arrows! Nock arrows! - Hold fast.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Hold fast! What are you doing? We need to attack them.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Hold fast.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Boulders ready! Hold fast! There's only one ship.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them? There's only one ship.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Archers, stand to! Man the below! - Nock.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Nock and set! Draw! Hold.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Hold.
s02e09	Blackwater	 There's no one on board.
s02e09	Blackwater	 More rocks coming up! Hold.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Wildfire.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Steer clear! Steer clear! Matthos! Get down! - Prepare to land.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The dwarf has played his little trick.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - The wildfire.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - He can only play it once.
s02e09	Blackwater	 We're too far from the gates.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The fire, their archers Hundreds will die.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Thousands.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Come with me and take this city! Sansa, come here, little dove.
s02e09	Blackwater	 My queen.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What are you doing? Praying.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You're perfect, aren't you? Praying.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What are you praying for? For the gods to have mercy on us all.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Oh.
s02e09	Blackwater	 On all of us? - Yes, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Even me? Of course, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Even Joffrey? - Joffrey is my - Oh, shut up, you little fool.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The gods have no mercy.
s02e09	Blackwater	 That's why they're gods.
s02e09	Blackwater	 My father told me that when he caught me praying.
s02e09	Blackwater	 My mother had just died, you see.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I was four.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your father doesn't believe in the gods? He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.
s02e09	Blackwater	 One for her.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Sit.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Not like that.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Drink, girl.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I should have been born a man.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They are your guests under your protection.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You asked them here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen.
s02e09	Blackwater	 If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And if the city should fall? You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person.
s02e09	Blackwater	 If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The best one's between your legs.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Learn how to use it.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You'll be glad of your red flower then.
s02e09	Blackwater	 When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good.
s02e09	Blackwater	 A precious thing like you will look very, very good.
s02e09	Blackwater	 A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.
s02e09	Blackwater	 More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull! He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They're coming.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They're coming ashore.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Rain fire on them.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Archers! There are too many.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Pod, run to the King's Gate.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Bring any men guarding it here, now.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Yes, my lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Let's go.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stannis is sending us fresh meat.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You, too.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Pull, pull! Go! Nock! Draw! - Draw! - Draw! Kill the Lannisters! - Loose! - Loose! - Draw! - Draw! - Loose! - Loose! To the Mud Gate, go now! First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate! Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse.
s02e09	Blackwater	 CERSEl: When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I could never understand why they treated us differently.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please.
s02e09	Blackwater	 He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You were Robert's queen.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And you will be Joffrey's.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Enjoy.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I don't think I know this one.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Pretty.
s02e09	Blackwater	 That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Here, it's not difficult.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I mastered it when I was four.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Straighten your back and bend.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Better.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You learn fast.
s02e09	Blackwater	 How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service? A few weeks, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 When did you leave Lorath? I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
s02e09	Blackwater	 But she was a nobleman's daughter.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You're not.
s02e09	Blackwater	 When did you come to Westeros? Ten years ago, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I imagine that's a very interesting story.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What's your name? Shae, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Tell us a story, Shae.
s02e09	Blackwater	 When I was 13, I Your Grace! What news? The Imp has set the river afire.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Where is Joffrey? On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Bring him back inside at once.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Your Grace - What? The king's presence is good for morale.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Bring him back to his chambers now.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Not here? - With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life? - No, but I - Now! When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Help me! Fall back! Fall back! Get the ladders up! Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum! Someone bring me a drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Fuck the water.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Bring me wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too? Eat shit, dwarf.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You're on the wrong side of the wall.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I lost half my men.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The Blackwater's on fire.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You're Kingsguard, Clegane.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You must beat them back or they're going to take this city.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your king's city.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Fuck the Kingsguard.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Fuck the city.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Fuck the king.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Loose! Put your backs into it! All right, get up! Loose! Clear! Forward! Loose! Forward ladders! Heave! Heave! Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep.
s02e09	Blackwater	 If you won't defend your own city, why should they? What would you have me do? Lead.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me? She did not say, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 All men to the battlements! Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stand fast! No! Get up, you fool.
s02e09	Blackwater	 We need more arrows! Where is the king? - Why isn't he with us? Who are we fighting for? Who leads us? I'll lead the attack.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'll lead the attack! - Yes.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - What are you talking about? Pod, my helmet.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Men, form up.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Men Men! They say I'm half a man.
s02e09	Blackwater	 But what does that make the lot of you? The only way out is through the gates.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And they're at the gates.
s02e09	Blackwater	 There's another way out.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'm going to show you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Heave! Heave! Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Don't fight for honor.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Don't fight for glory.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any.
s02e09	Blackwater	 This is your city Stannis means to sack.
s02e09	Blackwater	 That's your gate he's ramming.
s02e09	Blackwater	 If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Heave! Heave! Heave! Those are brave men knocking at our door.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Let's go kill them.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The battle is lost, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stannis' troops are at the gates.
s02e09	Blackwater	 When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Where is my son? I want to escort him back to the battle.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Why do I care what you want? - Bring me - Now listen to me Don't be afraid.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The queen has raised the drawbridge.
s02e09	Blackwater	 This is the safest place we can be.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Joffrey's not hurt.
s02e09	Blackwater	 He's fighting bravely.
s02e09	Blackwater	 His knights have rallied behind him.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They will save the city.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Shall we sing a hymn? Save our sons from war, we pray You must go.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Run to your chamber and bar your door.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stannis won't hurt you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 This one will.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Come with me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - I need to say goodbye to someone.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The queen said they'd rape everyone.
s02e09	Blackwater	 No one is raping me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Go.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Run.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The lady is starting to panic.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What are you doing here? Not here for long.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - I'm going.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - Where? Someplace that isn't burning.
s02e09	Blackwater	 North, might be.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Could be.
s02e09	Blackwater	 What about the king? He can die just fine on his own.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I can take you with me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Take you to Winterfell.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'll keep you safe.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Do you want to go home? I'll be safe here.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stannis won't hurt me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Look at me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stannis is a killer.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The Lannisters are killers.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your father was a killer.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your brother is a killer.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Your sons will be killers someday.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The world is built by killers.
s02e09	Blackwater	 So you'd better get used to looking at them.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You won't hurt me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 No, little bird, I won't hurt you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Heave! Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders! Attack! Roll it over! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Oh, fuck me.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Shh! Be calm, my sweet.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They're still fighting.
s02e09	Blackwater	 No one's going to hurt you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I'll tell you a story.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? - They lived in the woods.
s02e09	Blackwater	 - The Kingswood? Yes, my love.
s02e09	Blackwater	 In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub.
s02e09	Blackwater	 She loved him very much.
s02e09	Blackwater	 But there were other things that lived in the woods.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Evil things.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Like what? Like stags.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Stags aren't evil.
s02e09	Blackwater	 They only eat grass.
s02e09	Blackwater	 And wolves.
s02e09	Blackwater	 My lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	 CERSEl: He could hear them howling in the night.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The little cub was frightened.
s02e09	Blackwater	 His mother said, "You are a lion, my son.
s02e09	Blackwater	 You mustn't be afraid.
s02e09	Blackwater	 "For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 "You will be king.
s02e09	Blackwater	 "All the stags will bow.
s02e09	Blackwater	 All the wolves will bow.
s02e09	Blackwater	 "The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, "all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, "they will all come to you, little lion, "to rest a crown upon your head.
s02e09	Blackwater	 " And the cub said, "Will I be strong and fierce like my father?" "Yes," said his mother.
s02e09	Blackwater	 "You will be strong and fierce just like your father.
s02e09	Blackwater	 " I will keep you safe, my love.
s02e09	Blackwater	 I promise you.
s02e09	Blackwater	 Back to the boats! Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you! No! Father.
s02e09	Blackwater	 The battle is over.
s02e09	Blackwater	 We have won.
s02e09	Blackwater	 "And who are you," the proud lord said "That I must bow so low?" "Only a cat of a different coat "That's all the truth I know "In a coat of gold or a coat of red "A lion still has claws "And mine are long and sharp, my lord "As long and sharp as yours" And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o'er his hall With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	Pod.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Pod! Find Bronn or Varys.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Tell them I am very much alive.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Yes, my lord.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Would you like something for the pain? What happened? The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Where am I? These are your new chambers.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 For your trouble.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Thank you, Your Grace.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Ser Loras Tyrell.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your house has come to our aid.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before She remains innocent.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor ofjoining our houses.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Is this what you want, Lady Margaery? With all my heart, Your Grace.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I have come to love you from afar.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 A king must keep his word.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Margaery! We want Margaery! I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The gods are good.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I am free to heed my heart.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 My lady.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 My sincerest condolences.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They're right.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm not good enough for him.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You shouldn't say that.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You'll be good enough for many things.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He'll still enjoy beating you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But, if he's not marrying me He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I can see so much of her in you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 She was like a sister to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 For her sake, I'll help get you home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 King's Landing is my home now.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Look around you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We're all liars here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And every one of us is better than you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Come in.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Make yourself comfortable.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That doesn't look very comfortable.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Here, watch me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - No need for that, my dear.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - You sure? Most men like what they see.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm not like most men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That's what most men say.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Have we met? You wouldn't remember me if we had? I meet a lot of men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And I think you remember all of them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I think your true talents are wasted on them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You're very kind, my lord.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Allow me to return the favor.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You're afraid.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I know who you are.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 How do you know about that? I thought you said you knew who I was.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 What can I do for you, Lord Varys? Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I see a potential partner.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I'm afraid of him.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Oh, you should be.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He's a dangerous man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But everyone has their weaknesses.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You're a virgin, I take it? Walk.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Childhood must have been awful for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 One or two tried.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Ah.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But you fought them off.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But none of them were strong enough.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I'm strong enough.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Not interested.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Of course you are.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Ah.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 "They lay with lions.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 " Tavern girls, I'd say.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Probably served my father's soldiers.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That's how they earned this.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Must make you proud to serve the Starks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I don't serve the Starks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I serve Lady Catelyn.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - What are you doing? - Burying them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We shouldn't stay here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We should get back on the river.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I didn't leave it here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I had me dagger.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Untie me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Now! I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Whoa.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 What's your business here? Traveling a prisoner.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - You're a woman.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - A woman! Well, fuck me! If you've quite finished up - All right, we'll be going.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Whoa.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Whoa! Who do you fight for? The Starks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 What did he do? - Apparently eating is now a crime.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Who knew? - No, stealing is a crime.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But it's not a crime to starve.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That's justice for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Where are you taking him? - To Riverrun.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Why Riverrun? Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Why not kill him? - For stealing a pig? I don't give the orders.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He must be important to someone.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Sending him with you? How important could he be? All right, have it your way, my lady.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Do I know you? - Have you been to Ashemark? - No.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Then you don't know me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock? - Is it near Ashemark? - No.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I've never been there.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 What do you think of these beauties? I hope you gave them quick deaths.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Two of them we did, yeah.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Wait.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I do know you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That's Jaime Lannister.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I wish someone had told me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like? I was at Whispering Wood.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I saw him.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He's not the Kingslayer.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Sorry to disappoint you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I have a question for you both.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And I want you to answer it at the same time.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I count to three, you both answer.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 What's his name? One.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Two.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Three.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Two quick deaths.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Those were Stark men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I don't serve the Starks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I serve Lady Catelyn.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Stay.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I know that.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And you mean to do it anyway? I love her.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I know that seems important to you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It is important to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your father didn't love me when we married.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He hardly knew me or I him.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Love didn't just happen to us.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It lasts longer.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, - what you and father had? - Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting? Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And you agreed to it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You gave him your word.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If your father lived his life for one thing My father is dead.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You said you saw my victory in the flames.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I did.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I still see it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - The flames lied.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me? The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You claimed to speak for a god.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle? You talk about war as if you understand it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I've been fighting far longer than you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Have you? Show me how you fight.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Show me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god? Inside you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I murdered my brother.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We murdered him.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Share the weight with me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He wasn't your brother.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 This war has just begun.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It will last for years.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Thousands will die at your command.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You will betray the men serving you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You will betray your family.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You will betray everything you once held dear.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You are the Warrior of Light.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You will be king.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You promise these things, but you don't know.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 None of us know.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Let me show you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Look into the fire, my king.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Look.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I see fire.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Keep looking.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Do you see? Do you see, my king? Yes.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I will kill that man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They want you to know you're surrounded.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I know I'm surrounded.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They don't want you to sleep.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They want to sap your spirit before Thank you, wise bald man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 No word from my father? No.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Send more ravens.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You killed all the ravens.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The first time I saw Winterfell First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I saw it and I thought, "Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 "We never stood a chance against the man who lives here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 " Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You love reminding me of that.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father I will kill that man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Theon, listen to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I serve Winterfell.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Now Winterfell is yours.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm bound by oath to serve you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And what's your counsel, trusted friend? Run.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You have 20 men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You can't win.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Wait for nightfall and run.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 There's nowhere to run.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The Greyjoy who ran.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The shame of the family.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Don't go home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Join the Night's Watch.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 All his past crimes are forgiven.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I won't make it to the Wall.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 There are ways.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The road will be dangerous.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But with a little luck The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You'll have opportunities there.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You're not the man you're pretending to be.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Not yet.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You may be right.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They want to fuck us.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm ready for one.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Aye! - You think they're right? - Aye.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We die today, brothers.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Aye! - Mothers will name their sons for us.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Aye! Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Aye! And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke! Aye! - What is dead may never die! - What is dead may never die! Thought he'd never shut up.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It was a good speech.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Didn't want to interrupt.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 What is this? What are you doing? Let's go home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Come on.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Why should I believe you? Why would I lie about it? To create strife between my sister and me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Where before there was nothing but love.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Pod.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Yes, my lord? Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week? - No, my lord.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - You're a good lad.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It varies from cloak to cloak.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Then my hill tribesmen.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Have gone home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your father paid them quite handsomely.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We are.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Podrick, would you mind? There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Come along now, Podrick.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 My love.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It was good of you to come.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Good of me? Of course I come.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I want to see you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Believe me, you don't.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Have you looked? I will be the first.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Well? You are a mess.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - You should charge me double.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - You think I'm here for money? That was the arrangement we made.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I pay you and you lie to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Oh.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Fuck your money.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Let's leave.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Leave? Leave King's Landing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They tried to kill you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They will try again.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - You don't belong here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - What would we do in Pentos? Eat, drink, fuck, live.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I want to go with you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 So do it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Forget about them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Come with me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I can't.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I do belong here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 These bad people are what I'm good at.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Outtalking them, outthinking them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It's what I am.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And I like it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I like it more than anything I've ever done.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Are you going to leave? You have a shit memory.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I am yours and you are mine.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Look upon one another and say the words.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Father, smith - Father, smith - warrior, mother - warrior, mother - maiden, crone, stranger.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - maiden, crone, stranger.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I am hers and she is mine - I am his and he is mine - from this day until the end of my days.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - from this day until the end of my days.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 A house of ghosts, Khaleesi.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It is known.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Where are the guards? No guards.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Let them try.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Is this a riddle? Khaleesi! Khaleesi! Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Are you afraid of a little girl? How did he find us? - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 How did you know we'd come this way? After all the things you have seen, this is your question? How did you kill those guards? Was it hard? No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Show me how.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I want to be able to do it, too.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - If you would learn, you must come with me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Where? Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 My dancing master was from Braavos.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The girl has many names on her lips.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Names to offer up to the Red God.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 She could offer them all one by one.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I want to.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But I can't.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I need to find my brother and mother.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And my sister.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I need to find her, too.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Then we must part.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 A man has duties as well.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - What is it? A coin of great value.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Could it buy a horse? It is not meant for the buying of horses.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Then what good is it? If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, "Valar Morghulis.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 " Valar Morghulis.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Please don't go, Jaqen.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Jaqen is dead.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Say it again.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Valar Morghulis.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Valar Morghulis.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Good.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Farewell, Arya Stark.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Osha, what are you doing? Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - We'll make you better.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I feel just fine.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They burned it down.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They burned everything.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Not everything.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Not you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 But they may come back.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You have to go.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Put on your warmest clothes.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 North's the wrong way.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And Mother and brother are south.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We don't know where.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 There are too many enemies in the south.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Go to the Wall, to Jon.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I don't want to leave you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 No more than I want to leave you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I pulled you into the world.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Both of you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I've seen both your faces almost every day since.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Go now with Hodor.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Go on.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'll be right here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Osha.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You must protect them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You're the only one who can.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You may have to protect them against your own kind.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I've got no great love for my own kind.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I'll get you milk of the poppy.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Tell me where to find it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I don't want milk of the poppy.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Do it quickly.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Moon of my life.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That sounds like something you would do.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Or maybe it is a dream.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your dream, my dream I do not know.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 These are questions for wise men with skinny arms.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You are the moon of my life.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That is all I know and all I need to know.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They miss their mother.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They want to be with you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Do you want to be with them? You will be.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 When your dragons were born, our magic was born again.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It is strongest in their presence.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And they are strongest in yours.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You will be with them, through winter, summer, winter again.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Across a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And we will be with you until time comes to an end.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 This is not my home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They will be waiting a long time.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Dracarys.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We should be there by sundown.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Won't be a fun night for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Mance knows how to make crows sing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Not talking's not the way to go.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Careful with that.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You might cut yourself.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Enough of that! - Stop! - Why, traitor? So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black? Let 'em fight.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Your traitor father teach you that? Or was it your whore mother? We are the watchers on the Wall.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Burn the body.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Aye.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You don't want this one coming back for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Come along, Jon Snow.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 What the Khaleesi, please.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Come.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Nothing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I am king of Qarth.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I can help you now, truly help you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 We can take the Iron Throne.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - I'll bring you a thousand ships.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 All that you have dreamed is within your reach! I beg you, please! - Khaleesi.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - Please! Please! Khaleesi! It's all a lie.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Looks real enough to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Real enough to buy a ship? Aye, a small ship.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Take all the gold and jewels.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Is this goat? It's moose.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Well, you see a tree, let me know.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is - Just bloody kill me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 - No, truly.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 It's Jon and the Halfhand.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 They're back.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Two blasts is wildlings.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 You're not fighting them alone.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Come on.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	 Three blasts? Run! Wait! Wait for me! Grenn! Edd!
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - How?! Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Returning him may buy life for my children.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Barristan Selmy, it is time to put aside your sword.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're too old to protect anyone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Here, boy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Melt it down and add it to the others.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Where are my dragons?! I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I love her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Iron Throne is mine.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 No one wants you for their king.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Look to your sins, Lord Renly.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The night is dark and full of terrors.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Do you want to be a queen? - I want to be the queen.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Mance is gonna march on the Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 One brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - They'll never trust me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - They might if you do what needs to be done.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Come along, Jon Snow.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Dracarys.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 When I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I pray I serve you well.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The battle is over.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We have won.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If it weren't for your squire's bravery you'd be a dead man.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Loras Tyrell, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You said you saw my victory in the flames.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 This war has just begun.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You will be king.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 It's Jon and the Halfhand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Two blasts is wildlings.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Run! Fall back! Brother? Did you send the ravens? Tarly, look at me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Did you send the ravens? That was your job.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Your only job.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We need to get back to the Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 It's a long march.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow? Well, don't stare too long.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They're shy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 When they stop being shy, they get angry.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Crow! - Crow! - Look over there! - Crow! Crow! Look over here! Look! Ah, look, crow coming! Crow! You're wearing the wrong color.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Mance was a ranger.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 When I'm free, will I be free to go? - Crow! - Crow! Sure, you will.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Oh! And I'll be free to kill you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Got no respect, this lot.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What happened to their fathers? Some of them were killed by crows like you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And if he don't I smell a crow.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We killed his friends.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Thought you'd want to question this one.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What do we want with a baby crow? This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He wants to be one of us.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Friends twice your size.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - What's your name, boy? - Jon Snow.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Stand, boy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You can leave us.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The girl likes you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us? Don't panic, boy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He was my brother once.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Back when he had a whole hand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What were you doing with him? The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Why? He wants me to lead one day.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I want to be free.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 No, I don't think so.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I think what you want most of all is to be a hero.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'll ask you one last time-- why do you want to join us? We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I saw You saw what? I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I saw what took it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers? Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Did I come to the right place? We'll need to find you a new cloak.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What if you took off that bit there? Don't you want to leave something to the imagination? Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I want you to take it off.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Mouth.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Bronn.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Bronn.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I didn't hear that.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Apologies, ser.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Back away.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Then back away some more.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Lord Tyrion sent me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I will murder you, boy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He said it was a matter of life and death.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Pod? - It's your sister.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The queen.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What are they doing here? Protecting me, I assume.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Will you let me in? No, I don't think so.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me? They stay outside.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm not afraid of you, little brother.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Why are you here? - I wanted to see your face.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I should hope so.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Thanks to Father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Thanks to Father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 No? Curious.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But then I don't suppose you need much room.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're meeting Father today? How do you know that? Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Father told me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What do you want from him? What do I want from him? He's my father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're going to make me cry.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Why do you care what I want from him? Because you've slandered me to Father before.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Slandered? When? You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You did have your guards beat her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 A girl of nine, I believe.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I was nine, too.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 It's not slander if it's true.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And what's this truth you plan on telling him today? Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father? Because you're a liar.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Any lies in particular? You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Still makes me more clever than you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Oh, look at these two shining warriors.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Meryn Trant.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - You're no knight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Pod.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 That's exactly who I am.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 A number of people in this city want to kill me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're here to protect me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I've been doing that for a while now.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Do you grow bored protecting me? I grow poor protecting you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Briefly.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - I'm sure you filled your pockets.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And now my pockets are empty.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You've given me a taste for the finer things.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - I thought we were friends.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - We are.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But I'm a sellsword.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I sell my sword.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - How much? - Double.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Double? - I'm a knight now.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Knights are worth double.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Which means you can afford it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Here.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Here! Help me! Who are you? I was in the battle at Blackwater.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I was a captain and a knight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Aye, ser, and serving which king? The one true king of Westeros-- Stannis Baratheon.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I thought you were dead.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Everyone thought you were dead.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And your son? He may have swam ashore as you did.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 No, the wildfire took him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I saw it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm so sorry, my friend.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I, too, have lost a son.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 There is nothing worse in this world.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But, Davos, you were a good father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If I was a good father, he'd still be here.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Stannis lives? He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Will you take me there? There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 This war is not over.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Not for you, maybe.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We're both sworn to King Stannis.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I am sworn to no man.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I delivered the ships.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Stannis never gives up.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Never.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Now he will regroup-- - He's a broken man.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They say he sees no one-- not his generals, not even his wife.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What? They built a great fire when Stannis returned.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They say she sang to them as they burned.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm a pirate.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're a smuggler.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Servants of darkness.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Take me back there, please.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You cannot turn Stannis against her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You could try.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If you fail, they will burn you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If you succeed, they'll burn you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And you've only just come back to life.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Stay alive a little longer, my friend.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You call me friend.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You drank with me on my wedding day.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I have to stop her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Please, do this for me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We should set the siege lines There won't be a siege.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'd love a fight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The men would love a fight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I don't think we're going to get one.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 slaughtered like sheep.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The debt will be repaid, my friend.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 For them and for your sons.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 My best hunters are after him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - A Mallister? - Ser Jeremy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 My father's bannerman.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 She's your mother.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 She freed Jaime Lannister.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Water.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Water.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 This needs to be cleaned and closed.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What's your name, friend? Qyburn.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're lucky to be alive.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Lucky? The badge looks good on you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Almost as good as it looked on me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Are you enjoying your new position? Am I enjoying it? I was very happy as Hand of the King.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Yes.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I heard how happy you were.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You brought a whore into my bed.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 It wasn't your bed at the time.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I sent you here to advise the king.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I gave you real power and authority.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What do you want, Tyrion? Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I bled in the mud for our family.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Jugglers and singers require applause.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You are a Lannister.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 So tell me what you want.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I want what is mine by right.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I am your son and lawful heir.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You want Casterly Rock? It is mine by right.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Why? - Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Go, now.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Go.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Oh, one more thing.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Dorne.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 It's going to Dorne.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Why Dorne? - It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But it's not coming back.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He's going to stay in Dorne.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Don't ruin the game.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I told you, I don't want to play.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What about that one there? That one? It's going to Volantis.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Why? Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 That's not how the game works.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Why should I make up a story when I know the truth? Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Lovely day for it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Watching the ships.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Lord Baelish.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment? I saw your mother not long ago.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 She's very eager to see you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And your sister.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You said King's Landing was your home.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You are the property of the crown.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Stealing you would be treason.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If you were to tell just one person-- - I won't tell anyone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - How do I know? Because I'm a terrible liar.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You said so yourself.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Please, Lord Baelish.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Tell me what to do.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Tell me when.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're her handmaiden? Yes.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And you're his? I help manage his affairs.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - He's an important person.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - So is she.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We've both done rather well, you and I.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Yes.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Given where we started.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And where is that? It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Watch out for her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I always do.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Watch out for her with him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They're growing fast.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Not fast enough.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I can't wait that long.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I need an army.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The distinction means a good deal to some people.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne? It's too beautiful a day to argue.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're right.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Another lovely day on the high seas.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Don't mock them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They followed me across the poison water.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If they'll do it, others will.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And with a true khalasar-- The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And not before.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I heard you were dead.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Not yet.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We are alone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Your Grace, you are the rightful king.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Not only by blood.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're an honorable man, a just man.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And there is still a war to fight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I am fighting.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 By burning prisoners alive? How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos? I do not judge people for the gods they worship.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - I'm not your enemy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - You are my enemy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I could have saved those men.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Don't despair, Ser Davos.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What I told your son is true.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Death by fire is the purest death.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Your Grace! - Come on.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - She will destroy us all! - I will pray for you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Your Grace! Halt.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Down.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Halt.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Down.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Why have we stopped? It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 What is she doing? Who gave her permission? My lady.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We should have guards, my lady.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Why? Pardon me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Stop, my lady.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You'll ruin your dress.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I have others.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace? No.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He was a soldier.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He never came back.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And your mother? She died when she had me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He wasn't a knight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 He was just a soldier.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Your father did that.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Be proud of him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Was your father a soldier, too? You should be proud, too.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They saved us all.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 From now on, we're going to take care of you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 All of you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Directly to me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Please, sit.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Sit.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I do apologize, my lady.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Small council meetings.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time? That's a lovely gown, my lady.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Yes, it suits you perfectly.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I imagine you might be rather cold.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady? I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 - Doesn't it, Loras? - Yes.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I've never seen anything like it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Perhaps before.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Yes.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The king barely escaped with his life.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 My mother's always had a penchant for drama.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Our lives were never truly in danger.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You're right, of course.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 But you are your father's son.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We can't all have a king's bravery.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Hunger turns men into beasts.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Wheat, barley, apples.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 We've had a blessed harvest.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I'm sure she does.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They will stand until they drop.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Such is their obedience.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They may suit my needs.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Tell me of their training.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 _ _ _ _ _ _ They begin their training at five.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 They fear nothing.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Even the bravest men fear death.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 _ _ _ _ My master says the Unsullied are not men.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Death means nothing to them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 _ _ He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Tell the good master there is no need.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 _ _ _ My master points out that men don't need nipples.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 _ _ To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin? _ _ _ My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 How many do you have to sell? _ Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Many other buyers are interested.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The Unsullied are a means to an end.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Once I own them, these men-- They're not men.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Not anymore.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be? Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you? You'll be fair to them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You won't mutilate them to make a point.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You won't order them to murder babies.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 A great injustice has been done to them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Closing your eyes will not undo it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The warlocks.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I owe you my life, ser.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 The honor is mine, my queen.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 You know this man? I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 King Robert is dead.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I was sworn to protect your family.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I failed them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	 Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I saw what took it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 When I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How did you kill those guards? Show me how.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If you would learn, you must come with me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I want to, but I need to find my brother and mother.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And my sister.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You have to go.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Go to the Wall, to Jon.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Osha, you must protect them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're the only one who can.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 slaughtered like sheep.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The debt will be repaid, my friend.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 For them and for your sons.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Those were Stark men.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I don't serve the Starks.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I serve Lady Catelyn.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom this morning.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Not long ago we were attacked by a mob there.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The king barely escaped with his life.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My mother's always had a penchant for drama.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You said you'd take me home.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If you were to tell just one Please, Lord Baelish, tell me what to do.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Tell me when.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Watch out for her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Watch out for her with him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ah! We need to get back to the Wall.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We know what's out there, but we have to warn them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	  Don't think too much, Bran.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Relax your bow arm.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And which one of you was a marksman at 10? Father? You can't kill it, you know.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Why not? Because the raven is you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Hodor.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's all right, Hodor.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Hodor.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Were you inside the wolf again, little lord? No, it was the three-eyed raven.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He's back.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - There was a boy.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - I don't want to hear about it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - But you asked.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - We've got plenty of worries.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I know you didn't, little lord.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We need to move.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We don't know who might be after us.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No one even knows we're alive.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you? - No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Some good he is, then.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I don't know what other people know and what they don't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I only know the Wall is a long way off.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Did you ever think you'd marry one? I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Never? Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Pardon me, Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - My queen.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Lord Bolton.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Let me guess which one is the good news.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I hadn't seen him in years.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I don't even know how many.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We'll travel to the funeral together.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest? Something else? By the time Bolton's bastard got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And Bran and Rickon have not been found.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 They may have escaped.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Have you received any demands? No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Have you heard anything from Theon at all? Where am I? Who are you? What do you want? I want to do this.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests? Yes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So how shall we pass the time? By putting one foot in front of the other.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's going to be a very dull walk.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Dull is fine.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Trust me on this.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 People have been serving me since I was born.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 She's an honest woman.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 All the good it's done her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Not your concern, Kingslayer.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It had to be recently.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You weren't with her at Winterfell.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How would you know? Because I visited Winterfell.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Move.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Were you pledged to Stannis? - Gods, no.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ah, Renly.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Shut your mouth.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Could hardly escape the little tulip.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I knew him far better than you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I knew him as well as anyone.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He would have been a wonderful king.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Sounds like you quite fancied him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I did not fancy him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Oh, gods, you did.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Did you ever tell him? No, of course not.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're far too much man for him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm not interested in foul rumors.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Unless they're about me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's all true about Renly.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - They'd have never got him off it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Shut your mouth! I don't blame him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And I don't blame you, either.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We don't get to choose who we love.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Where are you headed, then? - South.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You? - Riverrun.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You can't win.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - No, you really can't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Looks like you're safe enough, though.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Seven blessings to you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - And you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He knows who I am.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - He doesn't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Maybe you're right.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But what if you're not? What if he tells someone? We're not doing it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He's an innocent man.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters? Make it tighter here.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's better.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It makes you look very strong.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No flowers.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I said no flowers.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 All these are wrong.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Bring others.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Yes, Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Bloody flowers.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 On the king.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Looks like a Tyrell rose.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Should be more than enough fabric.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Tell me what you think of her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Who? Margaery.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 She's an ideal match.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Yes, she is.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Not to me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself-- This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 She dresses like a harlot for a reason.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's what intelligent women do-- what they're told.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You need to ask yourself-- - I don't need to do anything.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Better.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Much better.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I still don't believe it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He didn't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He didn't want anything.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Littlefinger's not in love with me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Love is not the thing he wants.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He's too old.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 They never see it that way.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or? No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Send him in.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Lady Sansa.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ser Loras.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 May I escort you to them? I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You are too kind, Ser Loras.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You probably don't remember the first time we met.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A rose, a red rose.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Of course I did.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's more your color.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You take it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Thank you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're such a dear.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'll take my leave.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Lady Sansa.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Thank you, Ser Loras.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Come.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Kiss me, child.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We're very sorry for your losses.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - He was very gallant.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Gallant, yes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And charming and very clean.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Father liked him and so did Loras.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That does not make him wise.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 As to your fathead father-- Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us? She might think we have some wits about us.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 One of us, at any rate.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It was treason.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I warned them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So here we are to see things through.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes? Lemon cake's my favorite.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So we've been told.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm much less boring than these others.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden? I haven't had the pleasure.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No great pleasure, believe me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A ponderous oaf.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 His father was an oaf as well.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My husband, the late Lord Luthor.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I I You, you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you? Has he ripped out your tongue? Joff-- King Joffrey, he-- His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Yes, all Lannisters are lions.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand? I'm to be his wife.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I only want to know what that means.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Bring me some cheese.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The cheese will be served when I want it served.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And I want it served now.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Are you frightened, child? No need for that.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We're only women here.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Tell us the truth.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No harm will come to you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My father always told the truth.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Yes, he had that reputation.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And they named him traitor and took his head.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Joffrey.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Joffrey did that.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And he said that was mercy.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Go on.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I-- I can't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I never meant-- my father was a traitor.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My brother as well.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I have traitor's blood.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please don't make me say anymore.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 She's terrified, Grandmother.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Just look at her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Speak freely, child.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He's a monster.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ah.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's a pity.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please, don't stop the wedding.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Have no fear.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Even so, we thank you for the truth.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ah, here comes my cheese.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We're at war.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 This march is a distraction.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Then it's a distraction.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We need his men.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Have you lost faith in our cause? If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If you no longer believe-- I can believe till it snows in Dorne.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You don't think we can win? May I speak my mind, Your Grace? Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark? I think you lost this war the day you married her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Whoa, whoa.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're afraid of her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - And she knows it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - I'm not afraid of her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 May I help you, Lady Stark? No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-- You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Only a mother can make them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You've made them before? Twice.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Did they work? After a fashion.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But it would be a very long night.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So I sat with him all through the darkness.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Which boy? Jon Snow.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So I prayed to the gods, take him away.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Make him die.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He got the pox.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A murderer.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A woman he didn't even know.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Let him live and I'll love him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'll be a mother to him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And he lived.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And he lived.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And I couldn't keep my promise.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand? Yes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I've got wildling blood in my veins.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - These are my people.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - I understand.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Well, how could you understand? You want to protect your people.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Everyone hates the cave people.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army? No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Because that's the truth.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Shouldn't be long now.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What's wrong with him? He's a warg.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He's scouting for us.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What, you've never met a warg? Orell.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What did you see? Dead crows.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Hey.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Get up, Sam.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Get up.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I can't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If you stop, you'll die.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You don't care.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - 'Course we care.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You left me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 When the white walkers came, you left me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Aye, we left you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're fat and you're slow.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We didn't want to die.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Help me get him up.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Looks like that piggy is done for.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Help us get him up.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - He's slowing us down.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Just get him up! Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What is this? Get up, Tarly.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Is he all right? - Aye, I think so.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If he can't, we may as well just go without him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's enough.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Tarly, I forbid you to die.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you hear me? - Why should the rest of us-- - Rast you're responsible for him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What am I supposed to do? Make sure he gets back alive.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If he doesn't, you don't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Move on! I'm not dying for you, Piggy.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You hear me? Where's Rickon and Hodor? Looking for food.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What's out there? Not another step, boy.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Unless you want to drown in your own blood.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm unarmed.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That was poor planning.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My sister carries the weapons.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm better with them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Drop the spear.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Drop it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You must be Summer.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm Jojen Reed.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 This is my sister Meera.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And we have much farther to go.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm just trying to understand.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Would you please shut up about it? Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - I'm not listening.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - But just explain it to me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He offered to kill any three people you wanted.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Dead.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 All you had to do was give him the names.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Anyone.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You could have picked King Joffrey.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Shut up.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining? But you could have ended the war.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Where are we going? - North.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Maybe we already passed it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's 100 feet wide.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My mother grew up there.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My grandfather's a lord.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He'll protect us.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Could be a minstrel.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Shut up.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	  A lion still has claws  A minstrel's got gold sometimes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, - and buy some food.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Shh.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	  And so he spoke, and so he spoke   That Lord of Castamere   But now the rains   Weep o'er his hall   With no one there to hear.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	  What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf? Just a dirty little cub, I think.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Loose a few more shafts.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Don't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Put the sword down, girl.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You go on down the road.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Just keep on singing so we know where you are.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Leave us be and I won't kill you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Generous.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're a dangerous person.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I like dangerous people.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Why are your friends so shy? What friends? The fat one to your left and the lad beside him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You escape from Harrenhal? - Who are you? - Thoros of Myr.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No, who do you fight for? The Brotherhood without Banners.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Now come along.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'm not going with them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You've got nothing to fear from us, son.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We're trying to save it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Now come on.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And then you can go on your way.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Here's the thing, fat boy.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Half the country's starving and look at this one.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My lion.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We've spoken of this.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You cannot come here.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But you said I should come to you with any problems.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Did anyone see you? - No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You sure? My father does not make idle threats.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Having you killed would be the high point of his week.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You have to be absolutely certain.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 All right.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What is this problem? I'm worried about Sansa.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Baelish doesn't have friends.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I don't know her name.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Oh, Ros? The redhead? - How do you know her? I try to know as many people as I can.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You never know which one you'll need.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 She's a whore.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You fucked her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Oh, please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 All right, yes, I fucked her once.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Twice.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And was she good? Did you like her? Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What did she say about Littlefinger? That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger? We have to protect her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We can't.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A great beauty with a very old name.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty? Yes, she is, objectively, very.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Her face is quite pleasing-- to other men and to women, people in general.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But not to me, of course.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I only have eyes for you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You pervert.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You want her? - This child? - I don't even want to talk about her.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - But you are.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Only because you're making me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 This is cruel and unfair.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Cruelly unfair.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 "Oh, the cruelty.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Shae is so cruel to me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	" Hmm, yes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Now do you think I'm cruel? Only if you stop.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But you mustn't come here again.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Dangerous people.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Lady Tyrell, my king.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Send her in.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You wanted to see me, Your Grace? I'm leaving on a hunting trip.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I have everything I could want.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Good.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Good.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A welcome one.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A military encampment is no place for a lady.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady? Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it? The duty of any wife to any husband-- to provide him with children.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You failed to do this.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Why? - I-- I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart? No.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I do beg your pardon.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What makes you say this? Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-- he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He never wanted to try.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-- something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Maybe the fault was with me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No, he was a known degenerate.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Mmm.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 As is your right.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You must do whatever you need to do.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You are the king.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Yes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I am.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you like it? I just had it made.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's beautiful.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Will you show me how it works? It's a new design.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Much easier to load.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 There's no crank.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You use this lever to draw the string.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The bolt goes here.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 And then you just aim and Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I know a hunt is no place for a woman.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's not unheard of.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My father would never let me before-- You no longer belong to him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you want to hold it? May I? Please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Could you do it? Could you kill something? I don't know, Your Grace.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Do you think I could? Yes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Would you like to watch me? Yes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Stop! Stop! - Tell us the truth.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - About what? I don't know what you want.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I want the truth.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What truth? Why'd you take Winterfell? I took it to-- I took it-- - Who gave the orders? - No one.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - I took it on my own.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Why? To take the North while it was vulnerable.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What were you going to do once you took it? Hold it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Rule it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Good.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's very good.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Why did you do that? I told you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Why did you take Winterfell? I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Wait.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Wait, wait, wait.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I took it because I hated the Starks.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I hated them for holding me prisoner.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I wanted to hurt them.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What are you doing? Please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'll tell you anything.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Just take it off.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please, just take it off.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Your sister sent me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Yara? I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No, don't go.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please, please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 No, please don't leave me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please, please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please, please don't go! Please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Don't leave me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Please don't go.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Rickon, stay with us.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's all right.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The wolves will protect him.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Only when I'm asleep.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's how it begins until you learn to control it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're a warg.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's not just wolves.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Sometimes in my dreams there's a-- - A three-eyed raven? - You've seen it? We saw him together.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You haven't forgotten? Does it have anything to do with warging? No, the raven is something different, something deeper.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The raven brings the sight.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Seeing things that haven't happened yet? Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What's he telling him? Why don't you ask? Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him? Where's the shame in that? Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Some people will always need help.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 When my father died, I dreamt it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You didn't dream it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You saw it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 So did I.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You have the sight, too? When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But I saw that, too.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What else have you seen? Only one thing that matters-- you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I never liked the skinny ones.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Like drinking from a puddle.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I don't drink ale.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Yeah! - You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's very tedious for all concerned.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Now, how did three children-- We're not children.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal? Gendry's a smith.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He was apprenticed in the armory.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A smith, eh? Where'd you train? King's Landing.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Tobho Mott's shop.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That criminal.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 That's because he's twice as good.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Aha! A smith and a salesman.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Gendry stole us weapons.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 My brothers taught me.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ooh! To your brothers! You can finish your meals before you go.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It may be awhile before you see another.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You'll free us? - I gave you my word.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-- Hey, hey.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Now that is an uncommonly large person.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person? One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Poor man.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You have my sympathy.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Aha, not a man at all.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A Hound! So good to see you again, Clegane.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Thoros? The fuck you doing here? Drinking and talking too much.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Same as ever.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - A pretty prize, lads.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Yeah! Girl.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? It's a tough decision-- take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Silence, Kingslayer.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Good luck.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Which will she choose? Gambler at heart.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Wouldn't have guessed.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Be quick about it.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - I need to rest.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - Get up.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - What do you call them? - Get up now.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Corns.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I never used to get corns.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 This heel is ruined.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 There's no way-- I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Ooh.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You move well for a great beast of a woman.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You shouldn't grimace before you lunge.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 It gives away the game.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Bit of a quandary for you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 You're good.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Graceless, but good.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 We enjoy a good fight.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Gets our juices flowing.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 The Flayed Man of House Bolton.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 A bit gruesome for my taste.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 - You sure he's the one? - That's him, all right.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Give the man his silver.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off.
s03e02	Dark Wings, Dark Words	 I'd rather he takes yours.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	This march is a distraction.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Then it's a distraction.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - They're growing fast.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Not fast enough.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I need an army.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Who are you? - Thoros of Myr.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Who do you fight for? - The Brotherhood without Banners.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We're trying to save it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Your sister sent me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Yara? I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I will not fail you again.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - What's wrong with him? - He's a warg.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He's scouting for us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Orell, where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - What did you see? - Dead crows.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Get up, Tarly.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I forbid you to die.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're responsible for him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Make sure he gets back alive.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 So good to see you again, Clegane.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Girl.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? Get up.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Ah! Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Enough to buy me a new head? If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-- Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him "nephew.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	" He is your king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Robb knows I meant him no disr-- You're lucky I'm not your king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 No, there's glory enough to go around.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It's not about glory.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I seized an opportunity.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What value was the mill? The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Is he there now? Of course not.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We took the fight to him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He could not withstand us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I could have that head on a spike by now.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Instead, I have a mill.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We took hostages.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Willem Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Martyn Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Martyn is 15, I believe.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Tywin Lannister has my sisters.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Have I sued for peace? No.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons? No.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 How many men did you lose? But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-- We need our men more than Tywin needs his! I'm sorry.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - I didn't know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - You would have.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We seem to be running short of patience here.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Intimate.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Lovely table.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Better chairs than the old small council chamber.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Conveniently close to your own quarters.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I like it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What news of Jaime? have known about his escape for weeks.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is? - We are trying, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Try harder.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What do we have, then? Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, - in practice if not in name.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Well, let him have it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 She has always been positively predisposed toward me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Titles do seem to breed titles.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Fully agreed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Master of Coin? It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Hear, hear.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	  He lifted her high in the air   He sniffed and roared and smelled her there   She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair   But he licked the honey from her hair   From there to here, from here to there   All black and brown and covered with hair   He smelled that girl in the summer air   The bear, the bear and the maiden fair  I hope you're pleased.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You were armed when we were taken.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I was in chains if you recall.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 All my life I've been hearing, "Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	" You were slower than I expected.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And more predictable.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And I'm a woman.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I was still beating you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You were not beating me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Maybe you were as good as people said once.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 More than once.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You'd be wise not to resist.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Would I? - They'll knock your teeth out.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You think I care about my teeth? No, I don't think you care about your teeth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If you fight them, they will kill you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Let them have what they want.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What does it matter? - What does it matter? - Close your eyes.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Pretend they're Renly.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted? If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But I'm not, thank the gods.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Doesn't have to look pretty.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend? You're not our prisoner, little lady.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - What am I? - Our guest.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 No one's put any chains on you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 So I can walk away, then? These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're lucky we found you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You think you're good with that bow, you little twat? Better than anyone you've ever met.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 A coward's weapon.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I like to fight up close.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Why? So you can kiss him? You remember the last time you were here? Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Watch your head.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Off we go.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Walk up! What are you doing? We're about to leave.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm staying.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're what? I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 My brother ain't no king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Winterfell.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - You sure? - I'm sure.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Well, I made you something.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What is it? It's a wolf.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Yes, it is.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 That's the tail? Yeah.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Well, be safe.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Yeah, you, too.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Don't get stabbed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You don't burn your fingers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Good-bye, Hot Pie.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Good-bye, Arry.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Up you go, little lady.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Hey, Hot Pie.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It's really good.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I've missed you, Uncle.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Father missed you, too, from the day you left.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Maybe he never said it in so many words-- Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I was surprised when he died.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Didn't think death had the patience.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm glad you were with him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I wish to the gods I had been.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Did you make peace in the end? After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 "Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 "Wait for me and I'll come back to you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	" And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I will never see them again.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You mustn't think it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We don't know the truth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They could be in hiding.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Robb believes they're alive.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And he must go on believing.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And you must remain strong for him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're Robb Stark's wife.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Hold still.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Is it true what they say about him? I don't know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What do they say about him? That he can turn into a wolf at night.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 True.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 True.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're a Lannister, aren't you? Martyn Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Martyn Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You've nothing to fear.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 My husband doesn't eat children.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Unless it's a full moon.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Always the artists.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It's only horses.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 No men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You said there was dead crows.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 There was.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 How many men were here? About 300.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And you know what those men are now? We're all the same to them-- meat for their army.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you think anyone got away? It's not impossible.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You don't go far betting against Mormont.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And he lost.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 His best fighting men are dead.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Tormund.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Climb the Wall.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Take Orell and 20 good men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And take this one.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And if he's useful, good.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If not throw him off the Wall.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 See if crows can fly.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We're finally going to war, old friend? Hide near Castle Black.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 When I give the signal, hit them in the night.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - We'll meet again.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Aye.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - If you do your job.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Ah.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 How will we see your signal? Send your eagle above the Wall every night.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Ghost? What have we here? Frozen crows? We've come a long way.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Smaller flock than you went north with.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We can talk inside.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Oh, can we? They need some water.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Tether it and I'll be inside.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Keep your eyes where they belong.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They're not for you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Aye, pig's got value to me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You are a godly man? I am.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I got no fear of what's out there.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The real gods.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Women.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Barely a grunt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And she's almost as fat as this one here.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Well, look at him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He's a walking feast.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Here we are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Sharpen these for me, would ya? I see the head.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Push.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 That's it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're nearly there.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 One more push should do it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What is it? What is it? Keep quiet.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I can ride.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're sure? Ride east.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Follow the rising sun.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Your sister's waiting for you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We're not in the Iron Islands.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Go.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on back.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You refuse to tell me where you're going? I don't know yet.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The fires will show me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - How long will you be gone? - I don't know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're abandoning me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I will never abandon you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You are the Son of Fire.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - I am sworn to serve you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Then serve me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 When I return, you will understand.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 My enemies think they've destroyed me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I want Joffrey dead.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I want Robb Stark dead.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Make me another son.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I cannot.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Why? You don't have the strength.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It would kill you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm not so easily killed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Men have been trying for years.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I want you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Your fires burn low, my king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 There is another way.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 A better way.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Yes.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - I'm the one true king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But there are others with your blood in their veins.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The Lord of Light demands it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - To whom? - To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Give me your water.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Here, drink.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Leave this place, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Leave tonight, I beg you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And what is she to do for soldiers? We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan? - Three.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands? I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You know what I saw? Butchery.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Babies, children, old men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 More women raped than you can count.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But the Unsullied are not men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They do not rape.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you disagree, Ser Barristan? When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I bled beside him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Did you know him well, Ser Barristan? I did, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Finest man I ever met.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I wish I had known him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But he was not the last dragon.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace? They did not.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I want to buy them all.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 _ _ _ _ There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Is this what you mean by all? Yes.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 8,000.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And the ones still in training as well.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 _ _ Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I will have them all or take none.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Many will fall in battle.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 _ Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 _ Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The gold you have left is worth 10.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The Dothraki you have with you-- _ The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 _ Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining I have dragons.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'll give you one.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Khaleesi, please.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Three dragons.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - One.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Two.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 One.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They want the biggest one.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Done.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Done.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'll take you as well, now.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 A token of a bargain well struck.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 _ _ Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Aegon Targaryen proved that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're both here to advise me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Is that understood? Do you have a name? This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice? No, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 No family living.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You belong to me now.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It is your duty to tell me the truth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Yes, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Lying is a great offense.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you know what he said to me? "Let me die.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	" There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience? All questions have been taken from them.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They obey, that is all.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Once they are yours, they are yours.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They will fall on their swords if you command it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You may go hungry.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You may fall sick.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You may be killed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Valar morghulis.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Yes, all men must die.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But we are not men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm surprised you're surprised.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 This is the safest place in the city.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Not for bastards.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 That's all of them, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Thank you, my dear.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Pod.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Pod.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Take them outside.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - I'll be there in a moment.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Yes, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Only my life.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Not all that significant, I'm afraid.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You should have him knighted.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If only the Master of Coin had such power.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If only.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I owe you a significant debt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Our redheaded friend.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You secured her release when the queen detained her.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Oh, that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Of course.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 A simple misunderstanding.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We don't.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I did fuck her once.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - I know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - But we don't.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But how would the queen get that idea? Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position? Keep a low profile.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Well, you are richer than I am.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Good point.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They're only numbers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Numbers on paper.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Trivial even.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You want a real challenge? Try whores.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I've tried quite a few.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Well, lots of work to do.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Enjoy the Eyrie.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on, I'm here later.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Tonight, then.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Looks like dull reading.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You think all reading is dull reading.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Unless he made it all up, yes.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Podrick, do keep up.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Yes, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Podrick.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Yes, my lord? After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman? - No, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Wonderful.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Genna specializes in first-timers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 She's not bad with second-timers, either.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Uh, my lord A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say? Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He's handsome.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You didn't tell me he was handsome.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 My lord, I don't even She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as "my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	" Be back in time for my supper.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Pace yourself, lad.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Let me guess.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He's not a magician.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 No.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - He's stealing it? - Worse, he's borrowing it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What's wrong with that? We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The crown owes millions to my father.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I've never borrowed money before.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm not clear on the rules.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And what if I don't? Well, you have to.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But what if I don't? This is why I don't lend you money.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We owe them tens of millions.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 One way or another, they always get their gold back.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Ah, the return of the conquering hero.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Does he have a little jaunt in his step? The lad's practically skipping.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You were gone a long time.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I trust you got your money's worth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Or should I say my money's worth? Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 This is more than I give you in a year.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 He's a squire.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You don't pay him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They wouldn't take it, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What did you tell them? I didn't tell them anything.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - What did you do to them? - Lots of things.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And they seemed to like these things? Yes, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Of course they seemed to like it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 They're paid to seem to like it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Only they weren't paid.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free? Is that what you're telling us? Sit down, Podrick.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We're going to need details.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Copious details.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Ha! Ha! You know how we deal with runaways here, do you? Take off his pants.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 No! No! No, no, no! I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 No, please! No, no, no! No, don't! No, please! No! No! You little bastard.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'll take the big bitch first.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Nobody said shit about you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're only making it worse.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Take her over there where it's dark.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'd like a little privacy.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on! You know who she is, don't you? A big dumb bitch from who cares where.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Never been with a woman that big.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 She's Brienne of Tarth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Heard of Tarth? I'm gonna cut your throat! They call it the Sapphire Isle.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Sapphires are gemstones.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - The blue ones.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - I know what they are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Bring her back here.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Yes, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Get up.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on, on your feet.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Unbesmirched.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Not defiled.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Fancy word for a fancy man.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I learned a lot of fancy words.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I bet you did.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back? You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Lands, titles-- you'll have them all.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 The North can't win this war.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're a smart man.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You understand that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We have the numbers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 We have the gold.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Aye, you have both.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Hard to argue with that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 None of us are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Come on, men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I'm famished, actually.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Well, I do like partridge.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Will this work as a table, my lord? Oh, yes.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Yes, this will do nic-- ah! On the stump.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You think you're the smartest man there is.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - My father-- - And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say "my father" and that's it, all your troubles are gone.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Don't.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 - Have you got something to say? Careful.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You don't want to say the wrong thing.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Never forget that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	 Here, this should help you remember.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	  All black and brown and covered with hair   Three boys, a goat, and a dancing bear   They danced and spun right to the fair   How sweet she was, so pure and fair   The maid with honey up in her hair   He smelled her all in the summer air   The maid with honey up in her hair   From there to here, from here to there   All black and brown and covered in hair   He smelled that girl in the summer air  -  The bear, the bear  -  The maiden fair   Oh, I'm a maid and I'm pure and fair   I'll never dance with a hairy bear   I called a knight, but you're a bear   All black and brown and covered in hair   From there to here, from here to there   All black and brown and covered in hair   He smelled that girl in the summer air  -  The bear, the bear  -  The maiden fair.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend? You're not our prisoner, little lady.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're lucky we found you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Ride east.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Your sister's waiting for you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Come on.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Come on.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I might be able to take you with me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Watch out for her.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Watch out for her with him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm Jojen Reed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 This is my sister Meera.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And we have much farther to go.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What have we here? Frozen crows? Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 That pig's got value to me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What is it? Yah! Come, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I want to buy them all.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I have dragons.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 They want the biggest one.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Done.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'll take you as well, now.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You think you're the smartest man there is.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say "my father.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	" You're nothing without your daddy.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Never forget that.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Here, this should help you remember.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	  How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass? Depends if he's had any practice.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us? He's going to fall.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He's going to fall off his horse.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Someone help him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Water.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Water.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Please, water.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Wa-water.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Water, please.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Please.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Please.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 If I die, you won't be getting-- Oh, enough.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Stop! Far enough.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Come on, you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Oh, Lord Tyrion.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Come in, come in.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I hope we might speak.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 In confidence.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Oh, always in confidence.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 About the events of the Blackwater.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Perhaps this is the wrong time? Oh, no.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's a wonderful time.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-- End your life? I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Which is why I'm coming to you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I need proof.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Proof? - Will there be a trial? - I need to know.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I have no proof, only whispers.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Do you want to hear it still? I don't know.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Do I? As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But what he wanted was far worse.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He burned my parts in a brazier.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I still dream of that night.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I dream of the voice from the flames.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A symbolic revenge of sorts.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Yes, ahem.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Which will require a degree of influence, which-- You do not possess at the moment.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I resolved to live to spite him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I begged.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I sold what parts of my body remained to me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Influence grows like a weed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The sorcerer.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Hello, my old friend.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's been a long time.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Or the shit.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And getting attacked or killed or worse.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And that.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Oh, look.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 More shit.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We need to get out of here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - How'd that turn out for us? - He had no way of knowing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We do now.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We know what's out there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Craster's been out here surviving.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster? We're like the sons he never had.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Mormont isn't gonna save you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 This lummox here isn't gonna save you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Shh, shh, shh.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - You woke him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I'm sorry.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - He's beautiful.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Shh! He's beautiful.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Does he have a name? - No.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Are you going to give him one? Why? Here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Gilly.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You said to hold it for you until you came back.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - You're back.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I wanted you to have it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I don't want your stupid thimble.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I want to save my baby's life.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Can you do that? Can you? I don't have time for you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You have to go after him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 How? You know how.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Brandon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Mother.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 How many times have I told you? - No climbing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Mother, I need to find it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - It's here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's calling me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I want you to promise me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 No more climbing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Promise me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Promise me! Promise me! - Mother! Mother! - Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me! Is he very large? No larger than usual, apparently.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - And yet they said that he was-- - Extraordinary.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The most extraordinary man they've ever had.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And they've had a lot of men.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple? What did he do to them? I don't know, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The girls are usually quite descriptive.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 So what did they say? They said it was hard to describe.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Huh.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income? He was too preoccupied to notice.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Sad, really.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark? He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But I don't think he's lost interest.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What makes you say so? - His shipboard inventory.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Ah.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You can read.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Rare for a woman in your profession.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Former profession.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Of course.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out? Two featherbeds.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls? He's not interested in them, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 How do you know? Because I'm one of his girls.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Prodigies in odd places indeed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It ate her while her son watched.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 There aren't more than 700 people of any importance.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Aerion Brightflame they called him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He was wrong.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried? Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre? Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'd love to see their tombs, really.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's like taking a walk through history.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - The tomb's just up here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - This is so exciting.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You were married here, Your Grace? - Yes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Must seem like only yesterday.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Seems like a lifetime ago.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Your husband, was he buried here as well? No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Such a tragedy.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - A fairly predictable tragedy.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Hunting and drinking don't mix.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I should say not.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My son's a hunter.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He had no business fighting an actual warrior.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But they do seem to yearn for it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And yet the world belongs to them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The gods have seen fit to make it so.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My father didn't want them here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm glad he did.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm sorry, Your Grace.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I couldn't agree more.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I've spoken with them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I know how they feel about you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You led the defense of King's Landing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 They adore you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Open the doors.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Joffrey.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Wait.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery! Bless you, Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery! - Margaery! - Long live Lady Margaery! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! Gods bless King Joffrey! How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Not far, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Your sister is waiting for you there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - She sent you to save me? - Yes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I served them, the men who were torturing you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Why would you risk your life for me? I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I was only a boy when they took you away.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, "That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	" And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Did he? I-- I don't know, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 They-- they never told me much.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My sister's men are loyal to her.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We don't need to hide from them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Not all those are your sister's men.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Some of them are loyal to your father.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What is it? I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What did he tell you to do? Raid fishing villages.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He didn't trust me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Thought I was a Stark.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Ha.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I could never be a Stark.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - He lorded it over you? - Didn't have to.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 All he had to do was be.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Be who he was born to be.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 His life fit him better than his clothes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And me my father gave me a choice and I made it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I could never be a Stark.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But ironborn, that's what I was born to be.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I paid the iron price for Winterfell.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I murdered those boys.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The Stark boys? Never found them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Maybe it's not too late.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It is.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My real father lost his head at King's Landing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I made a choice and I chose wrong.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And now I've burned everything down.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Not everything, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 She's up here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Yara.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Shh.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Wait.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I brought him back.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He killed the others.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What? No, I didn't.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You can't! No, please stop! No! Put him back where he belongs.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Eat.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What are you doing? I'm dying.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You can't die.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You need to live to take revenge.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I don't care about revenge.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You coward.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A little misfortune and you're giving up.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Misfor-- misfortune? You lost your hand.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My sword hand.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I was that hand.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You have a taste-- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You sound like a bloody woman.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I know what you did for me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You knew that.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Why did you help me? You wanted to speak to me? Yes, about Jaime.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What about him? I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response? - You started a war.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir? Whatever you can.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Whatever I can.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - You're still here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Yes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Why? Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Years and years of lectures on family and legacy-- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations-- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children? All right.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Contribute.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The Tyrells are a problem.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 She knows how to manipulate him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Good.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I wish you knew how to manipulate him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I don't distrust you because you're a woman.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I will.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Do you like it, Nana? Another golden rose.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 How original.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I eat from plates stamped with roses.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Roses are boring, dear.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 "Growing strong.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	" Ha! The dullest words of any house.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 "Winter is coming!" Now that's memorable.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 "We do not sow.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	" Strong.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Strong.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Those are houses you watch out for.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But a golden rose growing strong-- ha, that strikes fear in the heart.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Look, little loves.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A spider in the garden.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Run along now.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Grow strong.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My lady.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The city has been made brighter by your presence.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me? A little obvious, perhaps.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Oh, no, please.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Seduce away.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's been so long.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Though I rather think it's all for naught.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But you've come mincing all this way for something.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - So? - Might I sit? No.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm curious why you've sought me out.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? - She's an interesting girl.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Is she? No, not particularly.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But she's had an interesting childhood.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 She has, sadly.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Come, come.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You surrender rather easily.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Walk with me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Which is Sansa Stark? Neither.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A babe in the woods.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I admired her father.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Yes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head? I could not help Lord Stark.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Perhaps I can help his daughter.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - How? You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 That's hardly surprising.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Indeed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Littlefinger is not long for the capital.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And why have you come to me with this matter? Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He has acquired the first two.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 How long before he has the army? Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Which seems such a shame.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride? You must despise him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're working so hard to undermine him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Actually, I rather enjoy him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You are a clever man, Lord Varys.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You are too kind.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I believe I have a possible solution.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 One doesn't need to be clever for that.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's all rather obvious, isn't it? Ahem.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I didn't mean to disturb you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You haven't.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We'd like some privacy, please.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What did you pray for? - I can't tell you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - And you? - I'm sorry, I just can't.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Pig-face, she called me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I think it had something to do with my nose.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Porridge plague? - You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you diein agony.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But that's awful.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're-- I believed you! Porridge plague.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm an idiot.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Don't say that.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 No, you're not.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 So what happened to Alanna? Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's all terribly frustrating.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'm sure she's jealous of you now.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I want us to be friends, good friends.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 That would make me very happy.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You must see Highgarden.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You'd love it there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I know you would.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You should see the costumes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 People work on them for months.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I-- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The Queen Regent, you mean.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And if you were to marry Loras Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Would you like that? His name was Bannen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He was a good man, a good ranger.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He came to us from-- where did he come from? Down White Harbor way.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He came to us from White Harbor.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Never failed in his duty.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He kept his vows the best he could.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He rode far, fought fiercely.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We shall never see his like again.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And now his watch has ended.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And now his watch has ended.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It wasn't his foot that killed him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 That bastard Craster starved him to death.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Craster's got his daughters to feed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You on his side? We can't just show up and steal all his food.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He's a bloody wildling is all he is.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my 99th.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You ever meet a man with 99 sons? And more daughters than I can count.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I'm glad for you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Ah.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 They're as strong as they're gonna get.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Whose throat you gonna cut, old man? Wait outside.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My wives gave you bread.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 There's sawdust in the bread.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I told you to wait outside.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I gave you crows enough.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I've got to feed my women! So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter? Enough! Out! I am a godly man.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're a stingy bastard! Bastard? Out with you, you little thief.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You are a bastard.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The gods will curse us for this.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 By all the laws-- There are no laws beyond the Wall.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Unhand her.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I shall have your head for this.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - Quickly.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Quickly.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - What's happening? - I'm not going out there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - No, we have to go.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Now! Follow me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I know the best way.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Come on.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Can I take this hood off yet? I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Halt! - What is it? - Blackstrap rum.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Ugh! Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I'd have some.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Let's go home.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What is this place? Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You look like a bunch of swineherds.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Some of us were swineherds.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And some of us tanners and masons.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 That was before.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're still swineherds and tanners and masons.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier? No.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And I won't see them again.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Stark deserters.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Baratheon deserters.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You lot aren't fighting in a war.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're running from it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But here you are Which of us is running? Untie these ropes and we'll find out.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 What are you doing leading a mob of peasants? Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Ned Stark is dead.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 King Robert is dead.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My brother's alive.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You're fighting for ghosts.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 That's what we are-- ghosts waiting for you in the dark.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You can't see us, but we see you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 No matter whose cloak you wear-- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon-- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You found god? Is that it? Aye.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I've been reborn in the light of the one true god.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 As have we all.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You'll die soon enough, dog.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But it won't be murder, only justice.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And a kinder fate than you deserve.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Lions you call yourselves.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Dump your dead children at some other door.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 House Clegane was built upon dead children.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime? - Murder is a crime.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - I never touched the Targaryen babes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You murdered Mycah.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The butcher's boy.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 My friend.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He was 12 years old.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He was unarmed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And you rode him down.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Aye, he was a bleeder.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You don't deny killing this boy? I was Joffrey's sworn shield.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - The boy attacked the prince.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 - That's a lie! I hit Joffrey.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Mycah just ran away.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Then I should have killed you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Not my place to question princes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You stand accused of murder.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Only the Lord of Light may do that now.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 I sentence you to trial by combat.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here? Aye.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 She might be.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 But it's me you'll fight.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 The master says they are untested.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 He says you would be wise to blood them early.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 And who knows? In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Thus all shall prosper.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Is it done, then? They belong to me? It is done.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 You hold the whip.
s03e04	And Now His Watch is Ended	 Dracarys.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	The Tyrells are a problem.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You must see Highgarden.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And if you were to marry Loras You must give yourself to the Lord of Light.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I have a wife.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - She's shut away in a tower.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And she's given you no sons, only stillborns.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I lost one son to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I grieve for your sons, my lord.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't want your grief.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I want my vengeance.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - What value was the mill? - I seized an opportunity.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We took hostages-- Willem Lannister, Martyn Lannister.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm not your enemy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - This woman is evil! - Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You want to assassinate a girl? - Based on whose information? - Ser Jorah Mormont.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You bring us the whispers of a traitor.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Beric Dondarrion? If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You'll die soon enough, but it won't be murder.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I sentence you to trial by combat.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Is it done, then? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Dracarys.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lord, cast your light upon us.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lord of Light, defend us.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Show us the truth.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Strike this man down if he is guilty.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Give strength to his sword if he is true.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lord of Light, give us wisdom.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 For the night is dark and full of terrors.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Kill him! Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Bring him back from death and darkness.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 His flame has been extinguished.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Restore it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Lord, cast - Arya, don't! Bring him back from death and darkness No! Let go of me! Let me go! Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Burn in hell! He will.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But not today.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Tell me what you know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There are four to a patrol-- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 How often do these patrols go out? It varies.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You'd like to know that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There are 19 castles guarding the Wall.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 How many are manned? Three.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You sure of that? Which three? Castle Black.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Which others? Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 How many men remain in Castle Black? - 1,000.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Liar.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground? He's no crow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm not afraid of you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I like you, boy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We'll find out soon enough.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't need you to protect me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Of course you do.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Give it back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Well, I stole it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's mine.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 If you want it, come steal it back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ygritte! Ygritte! Ygritte! Seven hells.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ygritte! Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ygritte.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You swore some vows.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I want you to break 'em.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I want you to see me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 All of me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We shouldn't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We should.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-- That thing you did with your mouth-- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South? I don't know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Hmm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You seemed to like it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Aye, I liked it some.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Who taught you that? There's been no one else.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Only you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 A maid.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You were a maid.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I was a man of the Night's Watch.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 How about you? Were you a maid? What do you think? - Who was he? - Just a boy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He came trading with his brothers.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He had red hair like me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Kissed by fire.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But he was weak.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Not like you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That was the first one.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Then there was this Thenn boy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Yeah, thanks.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I think I've heard enough.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We'd best get back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Tormund-- I'm not done with you yet.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 How long's it been since you had a bath? Let's not go back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Let's stay here a while longer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Not ever.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I want my gold.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We're outlaws.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Outlaws steal.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're lucky we didn't kill you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Come try it, archer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'll shove those arrows up your ass.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You can't let him go.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's a murderer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's guilty.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Not in the eyes of god.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - You can't! Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Riders coming through! The Kingslayer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Down! On your knees.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Pick him up, Locke.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You've lost a hand.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 No, my lord, he has it here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Take this away.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Send it to his father? You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Cut her free.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Apologies, my lady.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're under my protection now.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Thank you, my lord.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Find suitable rooms for our guests.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We'll speak later.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lord Bolton.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Is there word from the capital? You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Stormed the gates with thousands of men.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your father's forces prevailed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ser Jaime isn't well.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Take him to Qyburn.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Will I die? - No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The corruption has spread.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I fear it must be cut away.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Then you'll die.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're no maester.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Where's your chain? The Citadel stripped me of it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They found some of my experiments too bold.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't need my right hand to kill you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Mmm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 With any luck, that will suffice.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You'll need milk of the poppy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - No milk of the poppy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - There will be pain.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I'll scream.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Quite a bit of pain.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'll scream loudly.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lord Baelish.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your Grace.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Of course, Your Grace.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I see.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin? My father's a practical man.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He appreciates facts.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Myself, I often find them a hindrance.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I shall do my best.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Thank you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark? I assure you that it will.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Gods, boy, that's enough.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We're not in a tavern.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Pardon, my lady.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - No need to speak.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Are there any figs? Fetch some.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I always take figs midafternoon.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They help move the bowels.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 To what do I owe this summons? Thank you for seeing me, my lady.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters? It's the royal wedding.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Naturally.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The word extravagant has been used.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding? - I understand that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Good.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 As of now, it's a huge expense.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And? And we're at war, Lady Olenna.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Yes, and maintaining supply lines-- I can't think how it slipped my mind.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 2,000 in support.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Provisions so this city might survive the winter.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 A million bushels of wheat.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 20,000 head of cattle.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 50,000 sheep.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm quite familiar with them.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 As is a royal wedding.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The people are hungry for more than just food.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They crave distractions.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 A royal wedding is much safer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Wouldn't you say? - I would.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Where did you go for them, Volantis? - My lady-- - Oh, very well.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Is that sufficient? - Quite sufficient.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Thank you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Very good, then.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That's settled.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Good day.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Give me that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What are you doing? Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Why? I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You don't have to do this.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I want to.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They need good men.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Robb needs good men, too.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We're leaving tomorrow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - And then you-- - What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm done serving.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He may be their leader, but they chose him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 These men are brothers.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They're a family.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I've never had a family.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I can be your family.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You wouldn't be my family.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You'd be "my lady.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	" Willem.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Willem! - Is this a rescue? - Lannister filth! Take him! Please, I didn't do anything.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm just a squire.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Please-- Bring them in.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires? Not murder, Your Grace.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Vengeance.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-- Was strangled by the Kingslayer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - They were his kin.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - They were boys! Look at them.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Tell your mother to look at them.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 She killed them as much as I.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 My mother had nothing to do with this.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 This was your treason.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's treason to free your enemies.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 In war, you kill your enemies.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Did your father not teach you that, boy? Leave him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Aye.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Leave me to the king.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That's how he deals with treason.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Our King in the North.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North? Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Hang the rest.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I only watched for the guards.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 This one was only the watcher.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Please! Please, no.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They made me do it! They made me! They made me! Word of this can't leave Riverrun.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Lannisters pay their debts.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They never stop talking about it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer? It wouldn't be lying.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He has to die.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Karstarks are Northmen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your mother's right.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You tended to their wounds.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You brought them supper.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Now they're dead.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You need Karstark men to end it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Spare his life.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Keep him as a hostage.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 A hostage.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I fought the Mad King for your father.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I fought Joffrey for you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We are kin-- Stark and Karstark.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That didn't stop you from betraying me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And it won't save you now.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't want it to save me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Kneel, my lord.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Would you speak a final word? Kill me and be cursed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You are no king of mine.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Joffrey.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Cersei.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ilyn Payne.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ser Meryn.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Hound.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What are you going to do with me? At first light we'll ride for Riverrun.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your brother's there now.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Don't think of it that way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - But it is that way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - It is.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - And it isn't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - More is than isn't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - So why don't you? - We need the gold.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Do I frighten you, child? No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're angry with me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And I don't blame you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But letting him go was the right thing.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I thought he killed you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - He did.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But how? Thoros how many times have you brought me back? It's the Lord of Light brings you back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - How many times? - Five, I think.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 No, this makes six.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Six.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There was the first time-- the Mountain.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Show her.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lance right through the chest.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Then I was stabbed in the belly.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Then it was an arrow in the back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And that axe in the side.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye? Both.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Fuckers couldn't decide.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And the Hound makes six.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You'd think you'd learn.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's not getting any easier, you know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Every time I come back, I'm a bit less.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Pieces of you get chipped away.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Just once.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't think it works that way, child.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He was a good man, Ned Stark.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's at rest now, somewhere.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I would never wish my life upon him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I would.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're alive.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Lord, cast your light upon me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Protect me in the darkness.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Burn away my sins.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Help me serve you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Use me as you will.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 My lady.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I meant to come sooner.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - The battle-- - I know of your troubles, my king.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Yes, of course.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You mustn't despair.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your claim is true.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - You will be victorious.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I believed that once.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Selyse.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I've broken a sacred vow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I've sinned.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I've wronged you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I have shamed you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - You're doing god's work.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You don't understand.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Red Woman-- the Lady Melisandre-- I know, Stannis.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 When she told me, I wept with joy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Oh, my sweet boys.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Petyr, Tommard, Edric.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 She gave you a son.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I gave you - nothing.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - That's not true.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 So you've come to see her as well? There is no need.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You must keep away from such distractions.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 She's my daughter.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I want to see her.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You are a king.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You don't need my permission.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	  Under the sea   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The birds have scales   And the fish take wing   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh  Shireen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Father! You've grown since I last saw you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Mother said you fought in a battle.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Did you win? No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Did the Onion Knight come back with you? He did.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He fought bravely.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He hasn't come to visit me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He won't be visiting, child.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Why not? He's my friend.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Look.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He made this for me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But don't tell Mother I have it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's a secret.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ser Davos is a traitor.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Best forget him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Not so hard.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You'll scrub the skin off.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What are you doing here? I need a bath.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Help me out of these rags.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Now get out.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There's another tub.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 This one suits me fine.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Don't worry.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm not interested.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 If I faint, pull me out.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Why should I care how you die? You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That was unworthy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Forgive me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You protected me better than most-- - Don't you mock me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I'm apologizing.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm sick of fighting.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Let's call a truce.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You need trust to have a truce.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I trust you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There it is.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There's the look.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I've seen it for 17 years on face after face.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You all despise me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Kingslayer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Oathbreaker.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 A man without honor.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You've heard of wildfire? Of course.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Mad King was obsessed with it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He burned lords he didn't like.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He burned Hands who disobeyed him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He burned anyone who was against him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Before long, half the country was against him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Aerys saw traitors everywhere.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city-- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Under houses, stables, taverns.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Even beneath the Red Keep itself.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Finally, the day of reckoning came.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I knew my father better than that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's never been one to pick the losing side.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I told the Mad King as much.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I urged him to surrender peacefully.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But the king didn't listen to me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 "You can trust the Lannisters," he said.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 "The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	" So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He told me to bring him my father's head.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Then he turned to his pyromancer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 "Burn them all," he said.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 "Burn them in their homes.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Burn them in their beds.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	" Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then? First, I killed the pyromancer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 "Burn them all," he kept saying.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 "Burn them all.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	" I don't think he expected to die.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He-- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That's where Ned Stark found me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark? Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 By what right does the wolf judge the lion? - By what right? - Help! Help! The Kingslayer! Jaime.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 My name is Jaime.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Onion Knight.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Ser Onion Knight.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Princess? Gods, what are you doing here? - Shh, you'll wake Bert.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Bert? He's the fat one.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's on guard duty tonight.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Go back to your room.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're not supposed to be here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - If your father knew-- - He said you were a traitor.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Are you? I am, child.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't care.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're my friend.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You must get bored down here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I brought you something to read.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's about Aegon and his dragons.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Aegon used to live here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Did you know that? - And the Targaryens built this castle.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Aye.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - So they did.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - You can hide the book under your cloak.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's a good one.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'll bring you more.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Thank you, my lady.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Take it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I have more.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 My lady, I can't read the words.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You can't? I'll teach you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - It's easy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It'll be fun.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Go.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We can't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells? I wouldn't know where to start.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 At the beginning.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 This word is Aegon.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And the title of the whole book is "An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	" It was a bitch of a siege.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke? The second.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Thoros of Myr.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Bloody madman.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Robert knighted you after the battle? Proudest moment of my life.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 "In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	" All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 In full plate metal for 16 hours.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Robert would have laughed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He was a good man, a great warrior.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And a terrible king.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - You swore an oath.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Yes.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Do you believe in her? With all my heart.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 These are the ones? Yes, khaleesi.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The officers.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut-- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Names that remind them what they are-- vermin.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ King Robert wanted her dead.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Of course he wanted her dead.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 She's a Targaryen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The last Targaryen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I didn't sit on the small council.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - No? Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally-- Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Can't say I minded much.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I always hated the politics.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Yeah, I imagine I would, too.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Mm-hmm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Which men do you have in mind? Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It suffered for a reason.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I sold men into slavery.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We both want her to rule.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Am I wrong? You only joined us a few days ago.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I can't speak to your intentions.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're not Lord Commander here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're just another exile.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And I take my orders from the queen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Come to bed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - You were right.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Karstarks are gone.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Almost half our forces.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Nothing.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Only wait.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Don't let him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He'd crush us in a day.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We could ride north.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Take your land back from the Greyjoys.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Wait out the winter.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Winter could last five years.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Now we're like a band of bickering children.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Give them a new purpose.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What? Oh, I don't know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't even know where Winterfell is.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And we're here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 King's Landing-- What is it? I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And Casterly Rock can't run away.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm going to take their home away from them.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Can you do it? I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry-- Walder Frey.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's such a splendid fighter.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Do you have any idea when we might I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It should grow quickly.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Joffrey won't let me leave.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And only one to let you go.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Because it will please me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Squire! Well fought, ser.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That was no fight.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I don't know you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Olyver, if it please you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 How did you know? Know what? That I wanted to.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 My lord I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 They rarely do, in my experience.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You have a good deal of experience, do you? With the husbands.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That didn't take long.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Well, it took long enough.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Is he? And who's the lucky girl? She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I've always wanted a ship.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Now I want a dozen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Strange, isn't it? - What is? It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your hair is different.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Is it? Lady Margaery wears it that way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Many ladies wear it this way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I have good news.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'll be leaving the city soon.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You still want me to come with you? It's not a question of what I want.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 It's what you want.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You want to go home, don't you? Of course.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 More than anything.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 But maybe it would be better to wait.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Not just for me, but for you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You've been so kind.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your true friend.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I do, Lord Baelish.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Petyr.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Petyr.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We'll speak again when I return.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're late.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What's she doing here? Our business concerns her, too.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Sit.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Never mind that now.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We have something important to discuss.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I'm Master of Coin.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Saving money is important.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Stop that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're making me uncomfortable.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Very well.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 She's a lovely girl.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Your jokes are not appreciated.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - It wasn't my best, but-- I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Karstarks have marched home.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The young wolf has lost half his army.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 His days are numbered.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Do you really think it's wise to refuse them? There's nothing to refuse.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 This is a plot.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Plots are not public knowledge.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And how do we do that? We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Wonderful.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Yes, it is.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You can't mean it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I can and I do.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, - nor should it be yours.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - She's a child! She's flowered, I assure you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 She and I have discussed it at length.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Surely you're capable of that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - And if I refuse? You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 And it is past time you were wed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I was wed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Or don't you remember? Only too well.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You should be thanking the gods for this.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 This is more than you deserve.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Tyrion will do as he's bid.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 As will you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 What do you mean? You'll marry Ser Loras.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - I will not.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - The boy is heir to Highgarden.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - No, I won't do it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 - Yes, you will.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're still fertile.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You need to marry again and breed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Father, don't make me do it again, please.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 Not another word.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 My children.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	 You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	  It's always summer   Under the sea   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The birds have scales   And the fish take wing   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The rain is dry   And snow falls up   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The stones crack open   The water burns   The shadows come to dance   My lord   The shadows come   To play   The shadows come to dance   My lord   The shadows come   To stay.
s03e06	The Climb	The raven brings the sight.
s03e06	The Climb	 Seeing things that haven't happened yet? Things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
s03e06	The Climb	 You have the sight, too? Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall.
s03e06	The Climb	 If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.
s03e06	The Climb	 - You'd like to know that.
s03e06	The Climb	 - He's no crow.
s03e06	The Climb	 We'll find out soon enough.
s03e06	The Climb	 - How long will you be gone? - I don't know.
s03e06	The Climb	 You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Yes.
s03e06	The Climb	 - I'm the one true king.
s03e06	The Climb	 But there are others with your blood in their veins.
s03e06	The Climb	 The Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
s03e06	The Climb	 We need to find Sansa Stark a different husband.
s03e06	The Climb	 You can't mean it.
s03e06	The Climb	 Tyrion will do as he's bid, as will you.
s03e06	The Climb	 - What do you mean? - You'll marry Ser Loras.
s03e06	The Climb	 - I will not.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Yes, you will.
s03e06	The Climb	 Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.
s03e06	The Climb	 Pick him up, Locke.
s03e06	The Climb	 Cut her free.
s03e06	The Climb	 Find suitable rooms for our guests.
s03e06	The Climb	 We'll speak later.
s03e06	The Climb	 How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Not far, my lord.
s03e06	The Climb	 Your sister's waiting for you there.
s03e06	The Climb	 Put him back where he belongs.
s03e06	The Climb	 Rickard Karstark, I sentence you to die.
s03e06	The Climb	 I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.
s03e06	The Climb	 There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army.
s03e06	The Climb	 The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry-- Walder Frey.
s03e06	The Climb	 I shall have your head for this! We have to go.
s03e06	The Climb	 Now! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! - Lord, cast your light - I thought he killed you.
s03e06	The Climb	 - He did.
s03e06	The Climb	 - But how? How many times have you brought me back? It's the Lord of Light brings you back.
s03e06	The Climb	 - How many times? - This makes six.
s03e06	The Climb	 ( theme music playing )  You've got too much wood in there.
s03e06	The Climb	 But the more wood, the bigger the fire.
s03e06	The Climb	 It needs to breathe.
s03e06	The Climb	 Take off that big log.
s03e06	The Climb	 Huh.
s03e06	The Climb	 You know your fires.
s03e06	The Climb	 Someone built your fires for you growing up? It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.
s03e06	The Climb	 And there were servants, of course.
s03e06	The Climb	 I knew you were highborn.
s03e06	The Climb	 Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men.
s03e06	The Climb	 Buried treasure.
s03e06	The Climb	 Thousands of years old.
s03e06	The Climb	 I think.
s03e06	The Climb	 What does it do? I'm not sure that it does anything.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's beautiful, though, isn't it? - How much longer? - Not so far.
s03e06	The Climb	 A few more days.
s03e06	The Climb	 Is the Wall as big as they say? Bigger.
s03e06	The Climb	 So big you can't even see the top sometimes.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's hidden in clouds.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're playing with me.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm not.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's 700 feet high, all made of ice.
s03e06	The Climb	 On a warm day you can see it weeping.
s03e06	The Climb	 Castle Black is nice enough.
s03e06	The Climb	 They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night.
s03e06	The Climb	 And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.
s03e06	The Climb	 Very tasty.
s03e06	The Climb	 Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.
s03e06	The Climb	 Dareon sings best.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Do you sing? - No.
s03e06	The Climb	 No, no, no.
s03e06	The Climb	 Not very well.
s03e06	The Climb	 Sing me a song.
s03e06	The Climb	 Oh, all right.
s03e06	The Climb	 Let's see.
s03e06	The Climb	 Oh ahem.
s03e06	The Climb	  The father's face is stern and strong   He sits and judges right from wrong   He weighs our lives, the short and long   And loves the little children   The mother gives the gift of life   And watches over every wife   Her gentle smile ends all strife   And she loves her little children.
s03e06	The Climb	  That's not how you skin a rabbit.
s03e06	The Climb	 I know how to skin a rabbit.
s03e06	The Climb	 Not by the looks of it.
s03e06	The Climb	 You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.
s03e06	The Climb	 I didn't see any game before I got here.
s03e06	The Climb	 If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.
s03e06	The Climb	 Well, I made this bow myself.
s03e06	The Climb	 Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.
s03e06	The Climb	 You learn how to use your fists, though.
s03e06	The Climb	 Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death? I had someone else in mind.
s03e06	The Climb	 Well, someone else is sitting right here.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
s03e06	The Climb	 Some of us are just a little better.
s03e06	The Climb	 Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them.
s03e06	The Climb	 Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall? You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Stop it! - Hodor.
s03e06	The Climb	 You've been fighting since you met.
s03e06	The Climb	 Just stop it.
s03e06	The Climb	 Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.
s03e06	The Climb	 You've been nasty to her every day.
s03e06	The Climb	 Of course she's nasty back.
s03e06	The Climb	 Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.
s03e06	The Climb	 First time I met you, you held a knife at me.
s03e06	The Climb	 We can't fight each other.
s03e06	The Climb	 We'll never make it to the Wall.
s03e06	The Climb	 I want you both to make peace.
s03e06	The Climb	 Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
s03e06	The Climb	 - I said so, didn't I? - Osha! You're a good little hunter.
s03e06	The Climb	 Thank you.
s03e06	The Climb	 See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you.
s03e06	The Climb	 Don't push me.
s03e06	The Climb	 Shh.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm right here with you.
s03e06	The Climb	 What's happening? I'm right here with you.
s03e06	The Climb	 What's wrong with him? The visions take their toll.
s03e06	The Climb	 He's having one now? I saw Jon Snow.
s03e06	The Climb	 You saw him? At Castle Black? He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
s03e06	The Climb	 Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall.
s03e06	The Climb	 Crows would come out every morning with axes.
s03e06	The Climb	 Your flock gets smaller every year.
s03e06	The Climb	 You ever climbed it before? No.
s03e06	The Climb	 But Tormund's done it half a hundred times.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're afraid.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Aren't you? - Aye.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's a long way up and a long way down.
s03e06	The Climb	 But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there.
s03e06	The Climb	 Here, sit down.
s03e06	The Climb	 I brought a pair for you.
s03e06	The Climb	 They're too big for you, but they're good.
s03e06	The Climb	 You kill someone for them? Nah.
s03e06	The Climb	 I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.
s03e06	The Climb	 He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me.
s03e06	The Climb	 He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
s03e06	The Climb	 Can we not talk about that here? "Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow.
s03e06	The Climb	 I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.
s03e06	The Climb	" Did I seem scared the other day? You were trembling like a leaf.
s03e06	The Climb	 Only in the beginning.
s03e06	The Climb	 Only in the beginning.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're a proper lover, Jon Snow.
s03e06	The Climb	 And don't worry.
s03e06	The Climb	 Your secret's safe with me.
s03e06	The Climb	 What secret? Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave.
s03e06	The Climb	 You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
s03e06	The Climb	 But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're going to be loyal to your woman.
s03e06	The Climb	 The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die.
s03e06	The Climb	 Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.
s03e06	The Climb	 We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's you and me that matters to me and you.
s03e06	The Climb	 Don't ever betray me.
s03e06	The Climb	 I won't.
s03e06	The Climb	 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
s03e06	The Climb	 Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step.
s03e06	The Climb	 And if you fall, don't scream.
s03e06	The Climb	 You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.
s03e06	The Climb	 Joffrey.
s03e06	The Climb	 Cersei.
s03e06	The Climb	 Ilyn Payne.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're good.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're not as good as you think you are.
s03e06	The Climb	 Face, tits, balls-- I hit 'em right where I wanted to.
s03e06	The Climb	 Aye, but you took your sweet time of it.
s03e06	The Climb	 You won't be fighting straw men, little lady.
s03e06	The Climb	 Show me your position.
s03e06	The Climb	 Keep your elbow high.
s03e06	The Climb	 You want your back doing the hard labor.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're holding.
s03e06	The Climb	 Never hold.
s03e06	The Climb	 - What? - Your muscles tense up when you hold.
s03e06	The Climb	 Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release.
s03e06	The Climb	 Never hold.
s03e06	The Climb	 But I have to aim.
s03e06	The Climb	 Never aim.
s03e06	The Climb	 Never aim? Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go.
s03e06	The Climb	 Trust your eye.
s03e06	The Climb	 There's someone out there.
s03e06	The Climb	 That's about far enough.
s03e06	The Climb	 We come as friends.
s03e06	The Climb	 Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that.
s03e06	The Climb	 Valar morghulis.
s03e06	The Climb	 Valar dohaeris.
s03e06	The Climb	 My friends here don't speak High Valyrian.
s03e06	The Climb	 Why are you here, my lady? Forgive my manners.
s03e06	The Climb	 I don't see many ladies these days.
s03e06	The Climb	 Lucky for the ladies.
s03e06	The Climb	 How many times has the Lord brought him back? Six.
s03e06	The Climb	 I've always been a terrible priest.
s03e06	The Climb	 Drank too much rum.
s03e06	The Climb	 Fucked all the whores in King's Landing.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.
s03e06	The Climb	 I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave.
s03e06	The Climb	 So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show.
s03e06	The Climb	 A spectacle for the locals.
s03e06	The Climb	 Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart.
s03e06	The Climb	 I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words.
s03e06	The Climb	 Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead.
s03e06	The Climb	 And they were the only words I knew.
s03e06	The Climb	 And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied.
s03e06	The Climb	 Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth.
s03e06	The Climb	 Our god is the one true god.
s03e06	The Climb	 And all men must serve Him.
s03e06	The Climb	 You've been to the other side.
s03e06	The Climb	 The other side? There is no other side.
s03e06	The Climb	 I have been to the darkness, my lady.
s03e06	The Climb	 He sent you to us for a reason.
s03e06	The Climb	 You have someone He needs.
s03e06	The Climb	 Bodkin point.
s03e06	The Climb	 Penetrates plate at 200 yards.
s03e06	The Climb	 Can you make 'em? Yeah, nothing tricky about it.
s03e06	The Climb	 Just need decent steel.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'll get you the steel.
s03e06	The Climb	 Come on.
s03e06	The Climb	 I don't like that woman.
s03e06	The Climb	 That's 'cause you're a girl.
s03e06	The Climb	 What does that have to do with anything? Forgive me, lad.
s03e06	The Climb	 What are you doing? Let go of him.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Tell them to stop.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Come on.
s03e06	The Climb	 He wants to be one of you.
s03e06	The Climb	 He wants to join the Brotherhood.
s03e06	The Climb	 Stop them! We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
s03e06	The Climb	 Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she? You're not doing this for your god.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're doing it for gold.
s03e06	The Climb	 We're doing it for both, girl.
s03e06	The Climb	 We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food.
s03e06	The Climb	 And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.
s03e06	The Climb	 You told me this was a Brotherhood.
s03e06	The Climb	 You told me I could be one of you.
s03e06	The Climb	 You are more than they can ever be.
s03e06	The Climb	 They're just foot soldiers in the great war.
s03e06	The Climb	 You will make kings rise and fall.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're a witch.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're going to hurt him.
s03e06	The Climb	 I see a darkness in you.
s03e06	The Climb	 And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me-- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes.
s03e06	The Climb	 Eyes you'll shut forever.
s03e06	The Climb	 We will meet again.
s03e06	The Climb	 You staring at my ass, Jon Snow? You all right? Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.
s03e06	The Climb	 Sorry.
s03e06	The Climb	 Were you sleeping? Wa-- Wa--? Wa--? Water? You want some water.
s03e06	The Climb	 I wish I had some for you.
s03e06	The Climb	 So let's play a game.
s03e06	The Climb	 Which body part do you need the least? - Please.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Please is not a body part.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'll tell you everything, please.
s03e06	The Climb	 But you've already told me everything.
s03e06	The Climb	 Remember? Your daddy was mean to you.
s03e06	The Climb	 The Starks didn't appreciate you.
s03e06	The Climb	 One good bit, though.
s03e06	The Climb	 The Stark boys, they're still alive.
s03e06	The Climb	 Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.
s03e06	The Climb	 Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good.
s03e06	The Climb	 Let's start with that.
s03e06	The Climb	 You've been wondering why you're here.
s03e06	The Climb	 Haven't you? Where you are.
s03e06	The Climb	 Who I am.
s03e06	The Climb	 Why I'm doing this to you.
s03e06	The Climb	 So guess.
s03e06	The Climb	 If you guess right, I'll tell you.
s03e06	The Climb	 By the old gods and the new, I swear it.
s03e06	The Climb	 You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.
s03e06	The Climb	 If I win, you'll let me go? If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.
s03e06	The Climb	 Please.
s03e06	The Climb	 You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't.
s03e06	The Climb	 You first.
s03e06	The Climb	 Where are we? - The North.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Too vague.
s03e06	The Climb	 Deepwood Motte.
s03e06	The Climb	 Terrible guess.
s03e06	The Climb	 Now, where? Last Hearth.
s03e06	The Climb	 Do I look like a fucking Umber to you? Karhold! Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in? No.
s03e06	The Climb	 It was just a guess.
s03e06	The Climb	 Very good, Lord Theon.
s03e06	The Climb	 And who am I? Torrhen Karstark.
s03e06	The Climb	 He's dead.
s03e06	The Climb	 Strangled by the Kingslayer.
s03e06	The Climb	 He was your brother.
s03e06	The Climb	 Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
s03e06	The Climb	 - You swore to tell me if I-- - You're right.
s03e06	The Climb	 Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman.
s03e06	The Climb	 I betrayed Robb.
s03e06	The Climb	 That's why you're torturing me.
s03e06	The Climb	 Yes.
s03e06	The Climb	 You win.
s03e06	The Climb	 Of course, you forgot to ask one question.
s03e06	The Climb	 You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm afraid I am.
s03e06	The Climb	 Everything I told you is a lie.
s03e06	The Climb	 This isn't happening to you for a reason.
s03e06	The Climb	 Well, one reason-- I enjoy it.
s03e06	The Climb	 Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off! I win.
s03e06	The Climb	 Thank you for riding here so quickly.
s03e06	The Climb	 I know travel isn't easy in these times.
s03e06	The Climb	 The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits.
s03e06	The Climb	 But when the King of the North summons us, we come.
s03e06	The Climb	 Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met.
s03e06	The Climb	 Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
s03e06	The Climb	 Of course.
s03e06	The Climb	 He deserves as much.
s03e06	The Climb	 I was in the wrong.
s03e06	The Climb	 As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.
s03e06	The Climb	 - I don't think that's-- - We are fighting for the North.
s03e06	The Climb	 Harrenhal is not in the North.
s03e06	The Climb	 It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
s03e06	The Climb	 And there's something else.
s03e06	The Climb	 We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
s03e06	The Climb	 Not what, whom.
s03e06	The Climb	 What? No.
s03e06	The Climb	 Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters-- Roslin.
s03e06	The Climb	 How old is she? Could I see her first? You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning.
s03e06	The Climb	 We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
s03e06	The Climb	 Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war? Father is old.
s03e06	The Climb	 It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
s03e06	The Climb	 And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
s03e06	The Climb	 He has every right to be.
s03e06	The Climb	 Please excuse us while we discuss it.
s03e06	The Climb	 Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm his liege lord.
s03e06	The Climb	 He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
s03e06	The Climb	 I didn't wound him.
s03e06	The Climb	 My answer is no.
s03e06	The Climb	 Listen to me and listen very carefully.
s03e06	The Climb	 You-- The laws of gods and men are very clear.
s03e06	The Climb	 No man can compel another man to marry.
s03e06	The Climb	 The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's all right.
s03e06	The Climb	 You heard him.
s03e06	The Climb	 If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.
s03e06	The Climb	 He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12.
s03e06	The Climb	 He's not gonna stop wanting it now.
s03e06	The Climb	 When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife? I have a war to fight.
s03e06	The Climb	 We can't win it without them.
s03e06	The Climb	 I have no time to haggle.
s03e06	The Climb	 You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
s03e06	The Climb	 You recall that heroic engagement? I had something less permanent in mind.
s03e06	The Climb	 I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war.
s03e06	The Climb	 If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'll marry her.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're paying for my sins, Uncle.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's not fair or right.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'll remember it.
s03e06	The Climb	 I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
s03e06	The Climb	 Yes.
s03e06	The Climb	 Most kind of them.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.
s03e06	The Climb	 I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.
s03e06	The Climb	 When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.
s03e06	The Climb	 If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.
s03e06	The Climb	 I should send you back to Robb Stark.
s03e06	The Climb	 You should.
s03e06	The Climb	 But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner.
s03e06	The Climb	 Why might that be? Wars cost money.
s03e06	The Climb	 Many people would pay a great deal for you.
s03e06	The Climb	 We both know who would pay the most.
s03e06	The Climb	 Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're right.
s03e06	The Climb	 Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
s03e06	The Climb	 It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.
s03e06	The Climb	 King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.
s03e06	The Climb	 He doesn't have time for anything else.
s03e06	The Climb	 He'll make time for you.
s03e06	The Climb	 As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.
s03e06	The Climb	 And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Shall we drink on it? - I don't partake.
s03e06	The Climb	 You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people? Very well.
s03e06	The Climb	 My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.
s03e06	The Climb	 Oh, she won't be going with you.
s03e06	The Climb	 I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-- You are charged with abetting treason.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm afraid I must insist.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're in no place to insist on anything.
s03e06	The Climb	 I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Impossible.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Why? My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.
s03e06	The Climb	 The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Your daughter-- - Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.
s03e06	The Climb	 Old.
s03e06	The Climb	 Old? Old.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm something of an expert on the subject.
s03e06	The Climb	 Her change will be upon her before long.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'll spare you the details of what will happen then.
s03e06	The Climb	 You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.
s03e06	The Climb	 The years punish us as well, I promise you that.
s03e06	The Climb	 My stomach remains quite strong, however.
s03e06	The Climb	 The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Do you deny them? - Oh, not at all.
s03e06	The Climb	 A sword swallower through and through.
s03e06	The Climb	 And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
s03e06	The Climb	 Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys? Of course.
s03e06	The Climb	 And you never No.
s03e06	The Climb	 Not once? Not in any way? Never.
s03e06	The Climb	 I congratulate you upon your restraint.
s03e06	The Climb	 But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.
s03e06	The Climb	 Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
s03e06	The Climb	 I wouldn't say that.
s03e06	The Climb	 True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters-- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.
s03e06	The Climb	 I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
s03e06	The Climb	 Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing.
s03e06	The Climb	 Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.
s03e06	The Climb	 I don't care what people believe.
s03e06	The Climb	 And neither do you.
s03e06	The Climb	 As an authority on myself, I must disagree.
s03e06	The Climb	 Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.
s03e06	The Climb	 And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt.
s03e06	The Climb	 It is a chance we simply cannot take.
s03e06	The Climb	 The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
s03e06	The Climb	 All right.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'll remove it for you.
s03e06	The Climb	 If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows.
s03e06	The Climb	 He will never marry.
s03e06	The Climb	 - He will never have children.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Oh The Tyrell name will fade.
s03e06	The Climb	 And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
s03e06	The Climb	 You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you? I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously.
s03e06	The Climb	 So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage? It's a rare enough thing-- a man who lives up to his reputation.
s03e06	The Climb	 No! We've gotta cut them loose! No! Take my hand! That's a wonderful pin.
s03e06	The Climb	 Oh, it's more of a brooch, really.
s03e06	The Climb	 Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so I'm very happy about Uh, yes.
s03e06	The Climb	 I-I am as well.
s03e06	The Climb	 I feel like I'm in a dream.
s03e06	The Climb	 Yes, me, too.
s03e06	The Climb	 Definitely.
s03e06	The Climb	 I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young.
s03e06	The Climb	 The guests, the food, the tournaments.
s03e06	The Climb	 And the bride, of course.
s03e06	The Climb	 The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.
s03e06	The Climb	 Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady? No.
s03e06	The Climb	 I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing.
s03e06	The Climb	 But it sounds wonderful.
s03e06	The Climb	 I can't wait to see it.
s03e06	The Climb	 And to leave this place.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.
s03e06	The Climb	 I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
s03e06	The Climb	 We can have them both killed.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement.
s03e06	The Climb	 Probably Sansa.
s03e06	The Climb	 Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
s03e06	The Climb	 Father doesn't discriminate.
s03e06	The Climb	 We're all being shipped off to hell together.
s03e06	The Climb	 On a boat you built.
s03e06	The Climb	 The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.
s03e06	The Climb	 I did what I did to protect our family.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm your family.
s03e06	The Climb	 A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival.
s03e06	The Climb	 Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
s03e06	The Climb	 I do admit it.
s03e06	The Climb	 If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.
s03e06	The Climb	 Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.
s03e06	The Climb	 Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.
s03e06	The Climb	 There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard.
s03e06	The Climb	 Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater? The impulse I understand.
s03e06	The Climb	 He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is.
s03e06	The Climb	 So, fair enough.
s03e06	The Climb	 He wants me dead.
s03e06	The Climb	 But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.
s03e06	The Climb	 But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army.
s03e06	The Climb	 The boy's an idiot.
s03e06	The Climb	 What do you want me to say? I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
s03e06	The Climb	 Probably.
s03e06	The Climb	 But not from Joffrey.
s03e06	The Climb	 He won't do anything now Father's here.
s03e06	The Climb	 Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
s03e06	The Climb	 Not the Tyrells.
s03e06	The Climb	 Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.
s03e06	The Climb	 Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore.
s03e06	The Climb	 And so will his children and their children.
s03e06	The Climb	 History will be taken from our hands.
s03e06	The Climb	 You may escape, at least.
s03e06	The Climb	 Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.
s03e06	The Climb	 When Jaime gets back, yes.
s03e06	The Climb	 But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.
s03e06	The Climb	 Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.
s03e06	The Climb	 Who's going to tell her? Do you think people will like it? I don't think they will even notice it.
s03e06	The Climb	 You're right.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's not my wedding.
s03e06	The Climb	 Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing.
s03e06	The Climb	 They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.
s03e06	The Climb	 Loras likes green and gold brocade.
s03e06	The Climb	 I'm sure he does.
s03e06	The Climb	 Will they let me invite my family? They haven't asked my opinion.
s03e06	The Climb	 But do you think they will? No.
s03e06	The Climb	 Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.
s03e06	The Climb	 - Should I-- - I beg your pardon, my lady.
s03e06	The Climb	 Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
s03e06	The Climb	 I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.
s03e06	The Climb	 Yes, it should be quite a wedding.
s03e06	The Climb	 I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.
s03e06	The Climb	 Of course.
s03e06	The Climb	 Alone, if I may.
s03e06	The Climb	 Why do you need to speak to her alone? Shae.
s03e06	The Climb	 Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.
s03e06	The Climb	 She's not from here.
s03e06	The Climb	 But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.
s03e06	The Climb	 Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
s03e06	The Climb	 It's all right, really.
s03e06	The Climb	 How to begin? It's-- this-- this-- this is awkward.
s03e06	The Climb	 taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.
s03e06	The Climb	 There aren't There aren't even 200.
s03e06	The Climb	 I've counted.
s03e06	The Climb	 Ha, I'm sure you have.
s03e06	The Climb	 Ugly old thing.
s03e06	The Climb	 Yet it has a certain appeal.
s03e06	The Climb	 The Lysa Arryn of chairs.
s03e06	The Climb	 Shame you had to settle for your second choice.
s03e06	The Climb	 Early days, my friend.
s03e06	The Climb	 It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.
s03e06	The Climb	 Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you.
s03e06	The Climb	 Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then? You're so right.
s03e06	The Climb	 For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.
s03e06	The Climb	 If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there.
s03e06	The Climb	 But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect you didn't bring her any enjoyment.
s03e06	The Climb	 And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.
s03e06	The Climb	 She was a bad investment on my part.
s03e06	The Climb	 Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new.
s03e06	The Climb	 Something daring.
s03e06	The Climb	 And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.
s03e06	The Climb	 I did what I did for the good of the realm.
s03e06	The Climb	 The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies.
s03e06	The Climb	 A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
s03e06	The Climb	 But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos.
s03e06	The Climb	 A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
s03e06	The Climb	 Chaos isn't a pit.
s03e06	The Climb	 Chaos is a ladder.
s03e06	The Climb	 Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.
s03e06	The Climb	 The fall breaks them.
s03e06	The Climb	 And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse.
s03e06	The Climb	 They cling to the realm or the gods or love.
s03e06	The Climb	 Illusions.
s03e06	The Climb	 Only the ladder is real.
s03e06	The Climb	 The climb is all there is.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Lord Frey requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Probably Sansa.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Who's going to tell her? Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Yes, it should be quite a wedding.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And you will swear to tell your father that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - My lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - She won't be going with you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Let's play a game.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Which body part do you need the least? How many times has the Lord brought him back? Six.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He sent you to us for a reason.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You have someone He needs.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You told me I could be one of you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You told me this was a brotherhood.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You will make kings rise and fall.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The visions take their toll.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He's having one now? - I saw Jon Snow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - At Castle Black? He was on the wrong side of the Wall, surrounded by enemies.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	  How far are we? About a week, I think.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You think? You don't know? When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You and your roads.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners? Most of the time, yes.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How do the men holding the banners fight? They don't, really.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And the drummers-- is that a great honor, too? Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So what good are they? - They help the men march.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - How? Well, it's-- it's the rhythm.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 She's right, you don't.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Cut her loose, too.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird? People work together when it suits them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 They're loyal when it suits them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 They love each other when it suits them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And they kill each other when it suits them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 She knows that, you don't.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Which is why you'll never hold onto her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 That rain will cost us another day.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Frey will wait.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He knows we're coming.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Yes, and that is why-- - I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Apologies, Your Grace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm not afraid of wet shits.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He can take it as he likes.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He's getting the wedding he wanted.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He's getting a wedding.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It was a king he wanted.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We should all get some sleep.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Attack.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Attack.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Who are you writing? My mother.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Is that Valyrian? - Gaaa.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Gaaa? Say hello for me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Rytsas.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 "Ritsas.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	" That was close enough.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Does she know her daughter's a queen? Not yet.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 That will be a surprise, I expect.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Many surprises for her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that? Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over? I will.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I promise.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I know she'd love to meet you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And her grandchild.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What, now? Are you certain? Are you angry with me? Angry? You're my queen.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Maybe one of each.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Don't get greedy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Can you leave the war for one night? I love you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Do you hear me? I love you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Most men fuck like dogs.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No grace, no skill.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 A few dozen thrusts and done.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You need to be patient.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Give her time.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And then you go inside, but slowly.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Come on! Hey, come on.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle? No, he didn't tell me anything.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He barely talks.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What, you're jealous? Of course I'm jealous.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You should be with one of your own.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You would if you were mine.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'd be good to you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You love him? 'Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy? Don't touch me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark-- all the candles burning in all those windows.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm stupid.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Come on.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Come walk with me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You would have been happy at Highgarden.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you? - No.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Has he been kind to you? He's tried.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You don't want him, though.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He's a Lannister.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say? I'm sorry.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Here I am complaining to you My son will be king.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Sons learn from their mothers.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I plan to teach mine a great deal.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What? My son with him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'll have to-- we'll have to-- If it's the pain you're worried about-- I'm not afraid of the pain.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Especially with the scar.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He's a dwarf.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And Loras-- Loras.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Some women like tall men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Some like short men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Some like hairy men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Some like bald men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Tyrion may surprise you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And that's a good thing? It can be.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We're very complicated, you know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Pleasing us takes practice.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you? Yes, sweet girl.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My mother taught me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 She's a child.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 She's a foot taller than you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 A tall child.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What's the youngest you've ever had? Not that young.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How much older? Older.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You're a lord, she's a lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And a beauty at that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't see the problem.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Shae isn't going to like it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Shae is a whore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time? I should never have told you about that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You want Shae, keep her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Wed one and bed the other.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You can rule the North in his name.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You want to fuck that Stark girl.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You just don't want to admit it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The ones already there don't need company.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You pay me to kill people who bother you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Evil notions come free.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your Grace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Grandfather.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You wanted to speak to me? Yes.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Any or all of them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I've been very busy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Many important matters require a king's attention.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Of course.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I have, yes.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 May I ask why? The Tower of the Hand is where I work.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand? We could arrange to have you carried.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Where did you hear about this? Is it true? Apparently so.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Don't you think we ought to do something about it? When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The skull of the last of them was right here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It was the size of an apple.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel? Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But I haven't been counseled.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You are being counseled at this very moment.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I should be consulted about such things.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your Grace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Yunkai.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The Yellow City.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We can defeat them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 On the field, with ease.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But they won't meet us on the field.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 They have provisions, patience, and strong walls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How many slaves are there in Yunkai? if not more.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You may approach.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Sit.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Will the noble lord take refreshment? Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Many an army has broken against our walls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Good.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My Unsullied need practice.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I was told to blood them early.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - My ship? - Yes, khaleesi.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 As I said, we are a generous people.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You shall have as many ships as you require.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And what do you ask in return? All we ask is that you make use of these ships.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I have a gift for you as well.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Your life.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - My life? And the lives of your wise masters.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But I also want something in return.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You will release every slave in Yunkai.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You are mad.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We are not Astapor or Qarth.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Those who survive, we shall enslave once more.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You swore me safe conduct.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I did, but my dragons made no promises.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And you threatened their mother.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Take the gold.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My gold.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Now get out.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The Yunkish are a proud people.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 They will not bend.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Who was he talking about? I don't know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Find out.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Chains? Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Smithed in Casterly Rock.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Golden chains.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You could buy a ship with these.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Do I need a ship? - What? - Am I going somewhere? - Of course you're not going anywhere.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So, am I invited to your wedding? I didn't ask for this marriage.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - I didn't want it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - No? She's a beautiful girl.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You said so yourself.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 That doesn't mean that-- this is duty, not desire.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her? I don't have a choice.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My father-- Does not rule the world.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And I'm Shae the funny whore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My feelings for you have not changed.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored? I swear to you it will not be like that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No? What will it be like? I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Any children we might have will be well provided for.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them? Listen.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Listen to me, my lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - I'm not your lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - You are.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You'll always be my lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm your whore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - What happened? - Wildfire.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I should have been here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Do you miss it? - King's Landing? - Your father's house.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Never had a father.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Never wanted one.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting? I'm lowborn.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 As low as can be.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My mother was a tavern wench.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Mine was a slave.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So was I.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I was born in Flea Bottom.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your blood is noble.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Are you saying my father, he was some lord or There.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your father's house.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm just a bastard.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Come sit by the fire, child.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Not talking, eh? That's a first.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't talk to traitors.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I didn't like giving up the boy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But you did.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You took the gold and you gave him up.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The Red God is the one true god.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You've seen his power.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 When he commands, we obey.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He's not my one true god.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No? Who's yours? Death.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - How many? - No more than 20.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - How far? - Less than a day's ride south.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt? Yeah! But what about Riverrun? It's not south.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It's west of here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It will still be west of here two days from now.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - You swore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - To take you home, and I will.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But we need to do this first.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Why? So you can steal their gold? I swear to you, this isn't-- I don't care what you swear because you're a liar.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You'll lie to anyone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 One day you'll understand, but now-- - Anguy, bring her back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Come back, girl! Kick all you like, wolf girl.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Won't do you no good.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I thought you were gone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Tomorrow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Have they told you what they plan to do with me? Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You're to remain here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 With Locke? I owe you a debt.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Now it's your promise.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You gave your word.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Keep it and consider the debt paid.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I will return the Stark girls to their mother.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I swear it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Good-bye, Ser Jaime.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Let me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It will take time.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust? Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The Lannisters send their regards.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Safe journey, Kingslayer.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Nothing to say? I liked you better before.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't remember chopping your balls off, too.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And don't you worry about your friend.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We'll take good care of her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Shh.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Gentle, my lord.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Gentle.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Shh shh shh.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Myranda knows what she's doing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Let her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 She trained as a septa, only she had other urges.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So did the septons, only they lied about it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Where is he? Who, my lord? There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Please.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Don't you want us to see it? Oh, come on.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Let us see it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Everybody talks about it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He sent you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Who sent us? We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We heard so much about it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Please.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Oh! There it is.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Oh.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Well, he's been through so much.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Look at his poor face.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Help me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 If he comes back We need to make him feel better.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And how can we make him feel better? I have an idea.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Oh, she's shy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You know how they are, these religious girls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Oh.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I felt something.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Oh, Lord Greyjoy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - As good as they say? - Mmm.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And why should you get all the fun? What? You like her better? Plenty there for both of us.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I was here first.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm sorry.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm sorry.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Terrible timing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But I was getting jealous.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about? Everyone knows you love girls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I bet you always thought they loved you back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your famous cock must be very precious to you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Would you say it's your most precious part? Please.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy! This is mercy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm not killing you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Just making a few alterations.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please! You're gonna scare it off.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm not gonna scare it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm gonna kill it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It's too far away.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Is that a palace? It's a windmill.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Windmill.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Who built it? Some king? Just the men who used to live here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Winterfell has towers three times that size.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 "I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	" If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What's swooning? Fainting.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What's fainting? When a girl sees blood and collapses.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Why would a girl see blood and collapse? Well not all girls are like you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Well, girls see more blood than boys.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Would you? So I could tear it off you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Or maybe one day I'll take you there.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 After we've taken our land back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Ygritte.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You won't win.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I know your people are brave, no one denies that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - You know nothing-- - Six times in the last thousand years, a King-beyond-the-Wall has attacked the kingdoms.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Six times they failed.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - And how do you know that? Every boy in the North knows it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We grow up learning it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The seventh will be the same.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Mance is different.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - You don't have the discipline.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You don't have the training.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your army is no army.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You don't know how to fight together.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - You don't know that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - I do.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I know it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 If you attack the Wall, you'll die.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 All of you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 All of us.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You're mine as I'm yours.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And if we die, we die.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But first we'll live.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Yes, first we'll live.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work? Hodor.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - That's where we are.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - What are you telling him? - It's all right, Osha.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - It's not all right.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Leave him alone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - He can speak for himself.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't fill his head with anything.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So what do you talk about? What's happening to him and what that means.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Go on, then.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Tell us what it means.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It's not like that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I wish I could tell him all the answers.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It would be much easier.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't want you talking to him anymore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - We're not going to Castle Black.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - What did you say? I told you already.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Jon Snow isn't there.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Oh, no.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'm not going back there.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Your brother is at Castle Black.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 That's where we're going.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Look at me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He wants me to find him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't have my legs anymore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 This is what I have now.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You have a family.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason? Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You don't understand.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You don't know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You don't know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 None of you know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 None of you have been up there.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I had a man once.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 A good man.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Bruni, his name was.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I was his and he was mine.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 But one night Bruni disappears.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 People said he left me, but I knew him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He'd never leave me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Not for long.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I knew he'd come back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And he did.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He came in through the back of the hut.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Only it wasn't Bruni.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Not really.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 His skin was pale like a dead man's.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 His eyes bluer than clear sky.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I don't know how I got the knife.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And he hardly seemed to notice.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I had to burn our hut down with him inside.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I didn't ask the gods what it meant.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I didn't need to.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I already knew.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 It meant the North was no place for men to be.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Not anymore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How is the pain, my lord? What's the purpose of an arm with no hand? Well, we've stymied the corruption.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Yes, we've stymied the corruption.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You're a learned man.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 All the good it's done me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You did well sewing up this mess.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Faint praise, my lord.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many? No, my lord.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 That's not my weakness.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What is? Curiosity.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The only way to treat disease is to understand disease.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You performed experiments on living men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - On dying men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - With their permission? My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Dying paupers, I assume.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Men with no families to complain.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 How many men have you killed, my lord? I don't know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Countless.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Countless has a nice ring to it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And how many lives have you saved? Half a million.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 The population of King's Landing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Did you-- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth? A bird flew off and a bird flew back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - A fair offer.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - A fair offer.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Locke won't take it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Why not? He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 He feels he's being cheated.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 They'd be fools to kill her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 These men have been at war a long time.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Most of them will be dead by winter.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 She'll be their entertainment tonight.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We have to return to Harrenhal.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Why? I've left something behind.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Absolutely not.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And what are those orders? To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 You think you'll get a reward.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I serve Lord Bolton.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Any appreciation your father-- You think you're getting a reward.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Let me explain something to you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I had nothing-- Or I could tell him this man saved my life.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We return to Harrenhal now.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Whoa.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Eyes open, lads.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - Be quiet.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	  The bear, the bear and the maiden fair   From there to here, from here to there   All black and brown and covered in hair   He smelled that girl in the summer air   The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!  Don't spare her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Don't spare her! Well, this is one shameful fucking performance.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Stop running and fight.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 A wooden sword? - I thought you'd gone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - You gave her a wooden sword.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We've only got one bear.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 I'll pay her bloody ransom.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Just get her out of there.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 This makes me happier than all your gold ever could.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 And that makes me happier than all her sapphires.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Ah! - Get behind me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 - I will not.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What the fuck are you doing to my bear? Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Pull her up.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Hold my legs.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Pull him up! The bitch stays.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 We're taking her to King's Landing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Unless you kill me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 She belongs to me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Lord Bolton's orders.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive? Well, we must be on our way.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	 Sorry about the sapphires.
s03e08	Second Sons	Is the Wall as big as they say? Bigger.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - How much longer? - A few more days.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I found something at the Fist of the First Men.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What does it do? I'm not sure that it does anything.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're not supposed to be here.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - If your father knew-- - He said you're a traitor.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I am, child.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You must get bored down here.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I brought you something to read.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My lady, I can't read the words.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I wouldn't know where to start.
s03e08	Second Sons	 At the beginning.
s03e08	Second Sons	 This word is Aegon.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - We can defeat them.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - But they won't meet us on the field.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They have strong walls.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
s03e08	Second Sons	 How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I didn't ask for this marriage.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My feelings for you have not changed.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Listen to me, my lady.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm not your lady.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm your whore.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You will release every slave in Yunkai.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You are mad.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We have powerful friends.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He said he had powerful friends.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Who was he talking about? - I don't know.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - Find out.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? - Your blood is noble.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - I'm just a bastard.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There is power in a king's blood.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're a liar! You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Now-- - Anguy, bring her back.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - Come back, girl! Kick all you like, wolf girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Won't do you no good.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'll give you one try, girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Kill me and you're free.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But if I live, I'll break both your hands.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Go on, hit me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Hit me hard.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Sulk all you want.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The truth is, you're lucky.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You don't want to be alone out here, girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Someone worse than me would find you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There's no one worse than you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ha, you never knew my brother.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He once killed a man for snoring.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There's plenty worse than me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I saved your sister from some of them.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're lying.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ask her, if you ever see her again.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Is that the Blackwater? The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you? Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Fuck Joffrey.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Fuck the queen.
s03e08	Second Sons	 That's the Red Fork.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm taking you to the Twins.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But why? Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why would they be at the Twins? Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.
s03e08	Second Sons	 So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They cannot be trusted.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The Yunkish are paying them well.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You know these men? Only by the broken swords on their banners.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They're called the Second Sons.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, "The Titan's Bastard.
s03e08	Second Sons	" Is he more titan or bastard? He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They all are.
s03e08	Second Sons	 How many? 2,000, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Armored and mounted.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Enough to make a difference? It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I imagine you're right.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He may not agree to meet.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He will.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons-- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and Daario Naharis.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - Mind your tongue.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - Why? I didn't mind hers.
s03e08	Second Sons	 She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You, slave girl, bring wine.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We have no slaves here.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? Under 2,000, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We have more, don't we? 10,000 Unsullied.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have 8,000 Unsullied.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're very young to be a captain.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He's not a captain.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He's a lieutenant.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Or you could fight for me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We've taken the slavers' gold.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We fight for Yunkai.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I would pay you as much and more.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Our contract is our bond.
s03e08	Second Sons	 If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ride with me and you'll never need another contract.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have no ships.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have no siege weapons.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have no cavalry.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A fortnight ago, I had no army.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A year ago, I had no dragons.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have two days to decide.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Show me your cunt.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You seem to be enjoying my wine.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink? - A barrel, then.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - Good.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.
s03e08	Second Sons	 In the Second Sons, we share everything.
s03e08	Second Sons	 After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'll come looking for you when this is over.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Gladly, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Half Robert, half lowborn.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Show the boy to his chambers.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'll come visit you soon.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What do you mean to do with him? You know what I mean to do with him.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Don't torture the boy.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king? No.
s03e08	Second Sons	 If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You've slaughtered many lambs? And none have seen the blade.
s03e08	Second Sons	 "And tho-- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod-- rode Vhagar-- Vhag--" Fuck me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 "Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog-- enough-- enough to swallow a horse whole.
s03e08	Second Sons	" Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They feeding you enough? Two meals a day.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I cannot complain.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You don't belong in a place like this.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Yeah.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm sorry about your son.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Didn't get the chance to tell you before.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Good lad.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Loyal lad.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Melisandre's returned.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I didn't know she'd been gone.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Came back with a bastard boy.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Robert's bastard boy.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why? She says there's power in king's blood.
s03e08	Second Sons	 She's going to kill him.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Sacrifice him.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What of it? We're at war.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night? Because he has your blood in his veins.
s03e08	Second Sons	 So did Renly.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Renly wronged you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He raised an army, stole your bannermen.
s03e08	Second Sons	 This boy has done you no harm.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - He's an innocent.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The night that never ends.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Unless I triumph.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I never asked for this.
s03e08	Second Sons	 No more than I asked to be king.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What's one bastard boy against a kingdom? Your Grace, why did you come to see me today? I came to free you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I swear it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I can't swear never to speak against her.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have little regard for your own life.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Quite little, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Verging on none.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory.
s03e08	Second Sons	 When my son was five he said to me, "I don't ever want to die.
s03e08	Second Sons	" I wanted to say to him, "You won't, child.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You won't ever.
s03e08	Second Sons	" I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I saw a vision in the flames.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A great battle in the snow.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I saw it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And you saw whatever she gave birth to.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real? Little dragon bitch.
s03e08	Second Sons	 She talks too much.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You talk too much.
s03e08	Second Sons	 She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
s03e08	Second Sons	 between her and your cock.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My cock will find a way.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Tell him.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Is there any place that my cock can't reach? She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I like them very much.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I just refuse to pay them.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And I'm no whore, my friend.
s03e08	Second Sons	 She sells her sheath and you sell your blade.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - What's the difference? - I fight for beauty.
s03e08	Second Sons	 For beauty? We fight for gold.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die-- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You'll die young.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There won't be a battle.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We only have to deal with her.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - She's well guarded.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - Tonight's a new moon.
s03e08	Second Sons	 One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Which one of us? Close your eyes, love.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Three coins.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The Braavosi does the deed.
s03e08	Second Sons	 One for each of us, darling.
s03e08	Second Sons	 No peeking.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Do you hear me? Follow my voice.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm right here.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have something for me? Valar morghulis.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Lady Sansa.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You look very handsome, my lord.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Oh, yes.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The husband of your dreams.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But you do look glorious.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Perhaps we could have a moment alone.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden? My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.
s03e08	Second Sons	 No, don't.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You won't be a prisoner after today.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You'll be my wife.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I suppose that's a different kind of prison.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I just wanted to say-- I'm just trying to say very badly-- I just-- just want to say I know how you feel.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I doubt that very much, my lord.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're right.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I have no idea how you feel.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And you have no idea how I feel.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But I promise you one thing, my lady.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I won't ever hurt you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Do you drink wine? When I have to.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Well, today you have to.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You look radiant, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Radiant? Why radiant? It's the word that came to mind.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We're going to be sisters soon.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We should be friends.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ah, but you know the song "The Rains of Castamere"? Of course.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They play it so often here at court.
s03e08	Second Sons	 So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? Not as well as you, I'm sure.
s03e08	Second Sons	 House Reyne was a powerful family.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Very wealthy.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The second wealthiest in Westeros.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung.
s03e08	Second Sons	 If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And finally one day, he rebelled against my father.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Gone.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A gentle word.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My father let them rot up there all summer.
s03e08	Second Sons	 It was a long summer.
s03e08	Second Sons	 "And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.
s03e08	Second Sons	" If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What are you doing? Your father's gone.
s03e08	Second Sons	 As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Could you Thank you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife.
s03e08	Second Sons	 One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Have you ever seen one like it? I've never seen anything like any of this.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Not in my life.
s03e08	Second Sons	 It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And stew is a kind word for it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We knew it wasn't chicken.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Here, taste this.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You think I'm trying to poison you? That's good.
s03e08	Second Sons	 That's really good.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Where do you think it's from? I couldn't even guess.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You only need a tongue to tell the difference.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Go on, have some more.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You still don't trust it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.
s03e08	Second Sons	 That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There are no mistakes.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Not for us.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm a mistake.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We're both a part of His plan.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He wants this for us.
s03e08	Second Sons	 No, He demands this of us.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I don't understand.
s03e08	Second Sons	 This-- this doesn't seem very religious.
s03e08	Second Sons	 According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You only need eyes to see.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Death is coming for everyone and everything.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A darkness that will swallow the dawn.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And we can stop it, you and I.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Let me show you what you have inside you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Come fight death with me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What are you doing? You have to trust me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What--? Get it away.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Get it off me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Don't fight, don't fight.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They won't take much.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why are you doing this? I told you there's power in the blood of kings.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And you have so much blood.
s03e08	Second Sons	 No.
s03e08	Second Sons	 No, no, no, no! Not there.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Not there! You can blame Ser Davos.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He wanted a demonstration.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Please.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Please, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My lord! The usurper Robb Stark.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The usurper Balon Greyjoy.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
s03e08	Second Sons	 So their son will be your nephew.
s03e08	Second Sons	 After you're wed to Cersei, of course.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law.
s03e08	Second Sons	 When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But your brother will become your father-in-law.
s03e08	Second Sons	 That much is beyond dispute.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Will you pardon me, my lord? Of course.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Of course.
s03e08	Second Sons	 En-- enjoy.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I've got a lifetime for that.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Stay.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You seem rather drunk.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Rather less than I plan to be.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding? This isn't about your wedding.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Renly Baratheon had a wedding.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - And? - If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - More than once.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - There you have it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Nothing to worry about.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I am the god of tits and wine.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Well My father once told me-- Nobody cares what your father once told you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Congratulations, my lady.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Thank you, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Well, you've done it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You've married a Lannister.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.
s03e08	Second Sons	 It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Yes, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.
s03e08	Second Sons	 How'd you like that? You wouldn't? That's all right.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Time for the bedding ceremony.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There will be no bedding ceremony.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Get rid of her gown.
s03e08	Second Sons	 She won't be needing it any longer.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ladies, attend to my uncle.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He's not heavy.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There will be no bedding ceremony.
s03e08	Second Sons	 There will be if I command it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What did you say? What did you say?! I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A bad joke, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Mine is so small.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My poor wife won't even know I'm there.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I am.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Guilty.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But-- but it is my wedding night.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Come, wife.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Not proud of it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Put you in the mood.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Is that wise, my lord? Tyrion, Sansa.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My name is Tyrion.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Is that wise, Tyrion? Nothing was ever wiser.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Astoundingly long.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What? Neck.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You have one.
s03e08	Second Sons	 How old are you exactly? Well, talk won't make you any older.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Stop.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I can't.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I could, I won't.
s03e08	Second Sons	 But your father-- If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I won't share your bed.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Not until you want me to.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Yes, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 How can anyone speak 19 languages? It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope-- what do you mean reasonably well? Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.
s03e08	Second Sons	 So guttural and harsh.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Athjahakar.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Athjahaka.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Ath-ja-hakar.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Athjahakar.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.
s03e08	Second Sons	 It is the only proper language for poetry.
s03e08	Second Sons	 No screaming or she dies.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What do you want? You.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Let her go.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Don't scream, lovely girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You were sent here to kill me? So why haven't you? I don't want to.
s03e08	Second Sons	 What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why? We had philosophical differences.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - Over what? - Your beauty.
s03e08	Second Sons	 It meant more to me than it did to them.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You're a strange man.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I only do what I want to do.
s03e08	Second Sons	 And this is supposed to impress me? Yes.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? They ordered me to murder you.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I told them I preferred not to.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They told me I had no choice.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I told them I am Daario Naharis.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I always have a choice.
s03e08	Second Sons	 They drew their swords and I drew mine.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Will you fight for me? Swear to me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.
s03e08	Second Sons	 My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You really ought to knock.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I brought your breakfast.
s03e08	Second Sons	 It's getting dark.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We could stay here for the night.
s03e08	Second Sons	 How hard can it be to build a fire? It doesn't matter.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Come under the furs.
s03e08	Second Sons	 We can keep each other warm.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He winked at me before.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - I doubt it.
s03e08	Second Sons	 - I saw him wink at me.
s03e08	Second Sons	 He blinked.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A what? Well, I mean, there's no real difference.
s03e08	Second Sons	 A wink is on purpose.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me? What? No.
s03e08	Second Sons	 This is just the way I talk.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'll build that fire.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Don't you think he should have a name? I don't know many boys' names.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jon Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Craster.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Uh, yes.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Maybe that's not-- Mormont.
s03e08	Second Sons	 That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Why is it a last name? Well, it's a family name.
s03e08	Second Sons	 For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name.
s03e08	Second Sons	 You see? So my father is also a Tarly.
s03e08	Second Sons	 His name is Samwell Tarly, too? No, Randyll Tarly.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Randyll is a handsome name.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Please don't name him Randyll.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Is your father cruel like mine? Different manner of cruel.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Not Randyll, then.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Don't.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Don't go out there.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'll be back.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I just want to look.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Go inside.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Go back inside.
s03e08	Second Sons	 I'll-- It's come for the baby.
s03e08	Second Sons	 Stay back! You stay back! No, you can't have him! No! No!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	You think I can't hear you every day talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and black magic? I don't want you talking to him till we get to Castle Black.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We're not going to Castle Black.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Jon Snow isn't there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Oh, no, I'm not going back there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You won't win.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You don't have the discipline.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - You don't know how to fight together.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - You don't know that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If you attack the Wall you'll die, all of you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 All of us.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I can't force them to meet us in the field.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Casterly Rock can't run away.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Can you do it? There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Walder Frey.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - You were sent here to kill me? - I don't want to.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Will you fight for me? The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Is that the Blackwater? - Where do you think I'm taking you? - Back to King's Landing.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - That's the Red Fork.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm taking you to the Twins.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your uncle's marrying one of the Frey girls.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That rain will cost us another day.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - He's getting the wedding he wanted.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - He's getting a wedding.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It was a king he wanted.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It's come for the baby.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You stay back! No, you can't have him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 No! Are you sure about this? No.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It's dangerous.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Take his home, take his gold, take his power.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Why are you telling me? You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground, the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 So Casterly Rock I'm asking your advice.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We have enough men? If Walder Frey cooperates.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If Walder Frey cooperates.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before we take the castle we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Or worse.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My honored guests be welcome within my walls and at my table.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It wasn't me you spurned.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It was my girls.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 One of them was supposed to be queen.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Now none of them are.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 This is Arwyen my daughter.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You could have had either.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Could have had both for all I care.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My granddaughter Marianne.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My granddaughter Freya.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My granddaughter Wertha.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Waldra.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Waldina.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - I'm Merry.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Fine.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My ladies.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 All men should keep their word, kings most of all.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The fault is not with you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Very good.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 There she is.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Come closer.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Let me have a look at you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Still can't see you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Old eyes.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Love.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Very honorable.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I call it a pretty face.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Mmm, very pretty.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Very shapely as well.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Been at this a long time.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Doesn't drop an inch.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your king says he betrayed me for love.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And I can respect that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths to get into that without a second thought.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Thank you, my lord.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Well, let's get ready.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Where? There.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 There.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It's a back gate.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your men, but not you? I have no interest in slaves.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 A man cannot make love to property.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 This is where we enter the city.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Very few guards.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They know me.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They let me inside We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I kill the guards.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Then comes the army.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways 'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You have a very suspicious mind.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You command the Unsullied.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 What do you think? You leave tonight.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Very good.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We'll prepare.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Ser Jorah.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You can use an extra sword.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your place is by the queen.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It was the first castle on the Wall.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Too big.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Impossible to maintain.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 No one's used it in centuries most likely.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens, I do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 How do you know all that? I read about it in a very old book.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You know all that from staring at marks on paper? Yes.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're like a wizard.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Here we are.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Alive.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Remember what happens to children who run.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Need a hand? - Need about eight hands.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Oh! Got to get this salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Many thanks.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't! Don't kill him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Dead rats don't squeak.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Killing little boys and old people.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 A real hard man you are.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 More than anyone you know.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're wrong.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I know a killer.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - A real killer.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - That so? You'd be like a kitten to him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He'd kill you with his little finger.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That him? - No.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Good.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't kill him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Please.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Please don't.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're very kind.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Someday it'll get you killed.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Where are we? The Gift, I think.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Brandon the Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Maester Luwin taught me that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It's good land and there's no war up here.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Why leave? Wildlings.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Sorry.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That's what Old Nan said.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 There's a storm coming.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I don't see any It's as good a place to shelter as any.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We can drink some blood while we wait.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I don't need much.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Only one old man and eight good horses.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 What's one old man doing with eight horses? He breeds them for the Watch.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 How's he keep folks from stealing them? The Watch protects him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Not today they don't.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - And proper steel.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Let's carve him up.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We just take the horses and go.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The old man's no threat.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I keep telling you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He's an old man.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I hope so.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Killing crows in their castle is tough.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Spread out.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Surround the hut and move in.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Ygritte! Clear the barn! No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Best part of the animal.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't worry.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They're still there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I know they're still there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm not afraid.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Of course you are.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 No point in trying to hide behind that face.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I know fear when I see it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Seen it a lot.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I knew fear when I saw it in you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're afraid of fire.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And I know why, too.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I heard what your brother did to you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That give you some ideas? Might do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Go ahead, then.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You might get away.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Might even make it there on your own.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They're just over the river.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 How did you get past it? Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Some climb straight up the ice.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Hodor.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Only three are still manned.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Hodor! One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Well, we'll have to open them up again.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - There's a rider out there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Just one? - There's more.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Hodor! Shh.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Shh.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - It's just thunder, sweet giant.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Hodor.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I yield.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - I yield.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Wildlings.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Where's Shaggydog and Summer? Hunting.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Hodor! - Shh, quiet, Hodor.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Hodor! Make him shut up.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If they hear us - Hush, Hodor.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 No no more Hodoring.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Hodor! - Hodor! - Hodor, calm down.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - You need to keep quiet.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - They're gonna hear us.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Hodor, be quiet.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Ah! Hodor! - Hodor, calm down.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Hodor! Hodor! - Hodor, be quiet! What did you do? Nothing.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I don't know.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 What's that? That's a horse dying.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Bring them over here.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That was the last of them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The rest are dead.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I heard shouting up there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Thunder.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Maybe it's ghosts.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That won't help you, grandpa.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Where you riding? Doesn't matter now, does it? No, it doesn't matter now.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You understand.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Let me stand at least.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Let me go with a bit of dignity.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Make the crow kill him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're one of us now.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Prove it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The wolves are out there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I can't do it by choice.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I don't know how.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It happens in my dreams.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're a warg, Bran.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It's in your blood.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I can't.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You just did with him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 A wolf is nothing compared to that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 She looks sharp.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Do it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Do it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I told you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He's still one of them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Go on, boy.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Go on! He's a crow.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He'll always be a crow.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And here's his crow wife guarding him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Kill him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - He's one of them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - No! Do you hear me? You're not gonna die for one of them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Do it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They'll find us if you don't.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You were right the whole time.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Hyah! When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm a great whistler.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The greatest in the land.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Daario Naharis.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That one was quick.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - There may be others.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - I doubt it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That's what you call a few guards? Come on! What do you got, huh? Lord Edmure I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're a delight to me, my lady.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Look upon each other and say the words.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger - I am hers - I am his - and she is mine - and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Is that safe? - They're long gone.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You were right.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Of course you can.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 But you did a lot more than that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You got inside Hodor's mind.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They can't do that north of the Wall? No one can do that anywhere.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 When I was looking through Summer's eyes, - I saw Jon.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Where? He was with the wildlings.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They tried to kill him, but he got away.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That's where we should go.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - If this many wildlings got through - I already told you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm not going north of the Wall.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Everything Jojen told me is true.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You saw what I did to Hodor.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I have to find the three-eyed raven.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Listen to me, little lord.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't worry.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm not asking you to come with me.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It won't be safe for Rickon.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Me? I'm coming with you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 No.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The Umbers are our bannermen.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They'll protect you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm coming with you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm your brother.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I have to protect you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Right now I have to protect you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Would you know how to find the Last Hearth? You southerners build your big castles and you never move.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're easy to find.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We're not southerners.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And I don't want to leave you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Shh, shh.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Come here, little soldier.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You and me, we're gonna have some adventures.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You don't have to do any of this.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Shh.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We'll be fine, you and me.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The Umbers are great warriors.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Even I heard about them growing up.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They'll teach you how to swing a sword.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I know how to swing a sword.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I learned to walk in darkness.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Say your good-byes, little man.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Keep this one safe.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He means the world to me.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We've been waiting a long time.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Haven't we? I don't know, you tell me.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 How long does it take to sack a city? It was just as you said.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They did not believe until it was too late.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And Daario Naharis? The city is yours, my queen.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 They're good, aren't they? They ought to be because they cost enough.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Look at the crowd there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun, and now look at him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The gods love to reward a fool.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - Uncle.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 - What? He's my nephew.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I love him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And he's a damned fool.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't you drink, Lord Bolton? Never do, my lady.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Dulls the senses.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That's the point.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls? Aye.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 So I have a fat young bride.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I hope she makes you very happy.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Well, she's made me very rich.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Pardon, my lord, my lady.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I need to find a tree to piss on.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My mother's alone with Roose Bolton.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I should rescue her.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Be kind.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 She's finally starting to like you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And I like her.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Striking your king is an act of treason.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 No, don't.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't insult them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your Grace.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said, and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 But they are not yet man and wife.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 A sword needs a sheath.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 And a wedding needs a bedding.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 What does my sire say? To bed! To bed! To bed! If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 To bed! To bed! To bed! Go on! Oh! Careful now, ladies.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 To bed! To bed! To bed! Poor girl.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Every bride suffers the same.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Oh, Ned forbade it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 That is a very strange custom.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 It seems normal to you? It's a tradition.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 But there are other ways of providing proof.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Boy or girl? I don't know.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Eddard.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses? I do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Go on, line 'em up! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Where are you going? Got salt pork for the feast.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The feast is over.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Doesn't sound like it's over.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 If I tell you it's over, it's over.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Got pig's feet, too.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Your Grace.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I've given you meat and wine and music, but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Robb! You ready to head home to Winterfell, right? Feast over yet, is it? Aye, it's over.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Follow him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Aim! It's too late.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The King in the North arises.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 He is my son.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 My first son.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Let him go and I swear that we will forget this.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I swear it by the old gods and new.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 We will take no vengeance.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 You swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter! Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Robb, get up.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Get up and walk out.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Please! Please! And why would I let him do that? On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 I'll find another.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 Mother.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	 The Lannisters send their regards.
s03e10	Mhysa	You will release every slave in Yunkai.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Reject this gift and I shall show you no mercy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - You are mad.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - It was just as you said.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - The bitch stays.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - I'm taking her to King's Landing.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Unless you kill me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Well, we must be on our way.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Please.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - I'm not killing you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Just making a few alterations.
s03e10	Mhysa	 No! Don't! The Nightfort's closest to Castle Black.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Stop.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - But your father-- I won't share your bed.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Not until you want me to.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's a crow.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Kill him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The wolves are out there.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're a warg, Bran.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Do it.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm going beyond the Wall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It won't be safe for Rickon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm coming with you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - She's just going to kill him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Sacrifice him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The boy's your nephew.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The usurper Robb Stark She says there's power in king's blood.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Got salt pork for the feast.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - The feast is over.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Robb! Mother.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The Lannisters send their regards.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It's too late.
s03e10	Mhysa	  Yah! Yah! - Go, move out! - The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! Here comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! Here comes Hmm.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What are you doing? I have a list.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A list of people you mean to kill? For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Fear of death, on the other hand You should learn to ignore them.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're a Lannister.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We're perfect for each other.
s03e10	Mhysa	 So how should we punish them? Who? Whom? Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Ah.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I hear that you're a pervert.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I am the Imp.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I have certain standards to maintain.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.
s03e10	Mhysa	 His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Lady Sansa! My sister used to do that when she was angry with me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And she was always angry with me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Why sheep shift? That's the vulgar word for dung.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My lady Well, you asked me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Oh! That's him! My lord, my lady.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Your father has called a meeting of the small council.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Killed a few puppies today? Show him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Come on, show him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Oh, apologies, my lord.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Old fingers.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "Roslin caught a fine fat trout.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Signed Walder Frey.
s03e10	Mhysa	" Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something? Robb Stark is dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And his bitch mother.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Write back to Lord Frey.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A joke.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Joffrey did not mean it.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Yes, I did.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
s03e10	Mhysa	 No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 She is no longer yours to torment.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Everyone is mine to torment.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Oh, I'm a monster.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I could have your tongue out for saying that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Let him make his threats.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I am the king! I will punish you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Any man who must say, "I am the king" is no true king.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My father won the real war.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He killed Prince Rhaegar.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock! The king is tired.
s03e10	Mhysa	 See him to his chambers.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Come along.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - I'm not tired.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We have so much to celebrate.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A wedding to plan.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You must rest.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm not tired! Come.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Not you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A treasonous statement.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Joffrey is king.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You really think a crown gives you power? No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I think armies give you power.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Mm-hmm.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Mm-hmm.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Oh, I know.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Walder Frey gets all the credit.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Which he got from me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Do you disapprove? I'm all for cheating.
s03e10	Mhysa	 This is war.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But to slaughter them at a wedding Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
s03e10	Mhysa	 So that's why you did it? To save lives? To end the war.
s03e10	Mhysa	 To protect the family.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The northerners will never forget.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Good.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Let them remember what happens when they march on the south.
s03e10	Mhysa	 All the Stark men are dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Winterfell is a ruin.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother? One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I will not rape her.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works? Use small words.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm not as bright as you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Does that amuse you? No, it's a very good lesson.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Easy for me, is it? When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family? The day that you were born.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Instead, I let you live.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And I brought you as my son.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Because you're a Lannister.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Sansa.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It's empty.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Let's find a place to sleep.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Don't, Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Maybe we shouldn't stay.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You'd rather be out there? There are a lot of stories about this place.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Horrible stories.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I always quite liked the horrible stories.
s03e10	Mhysa	 So did I.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Once.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You ever heard about the Rat Cook? No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Who's he? Just a cook in the Night's Watch.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember.
s03e10	Mhysa	 When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 That night he served the pie to the king.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-- It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He killed a guest beneath his roof.
s03e10	Mhysa	 That's something the gods can't forgive.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "The late Walder Frey," old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He thought he was witty.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Look at us now, Tully.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The Blackfish escaped.
s03e10	Mhysa	 An old man on the run with no allies.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I have Tywin Lannister backing me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Who does he have? - As you say.
s03e10	Mhysa	 They all laughed at me, all those high lords.
s03e10	Mhysa	 They all thought they were better than me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.
s03e10	Mhysa	 People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch? You'll be needing a new young girl.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Yeah.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Got that to look forward to.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And you, the Warden of the North.
s03e10	Mhysa	 No more Starks to bow and scrape to.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He ignored my advice at every turn.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If he'd been a trifle less arrogant Calling himself the Young Wolf.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How's that for pomposity? Well, here's to the Young Wolf! Forever young.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over? At some point perhaps.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But Winterfell's in ruins.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Yeah.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I heard he killed all the ravens.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And after that, nothing.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Oh.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And? Ramsay delivered the terms.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would.
s03e10	Mhysa	 They handed him over trussed and hooded.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But Ramsay-- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Well, the girls weren't lying.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You had a good-sized cock.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What? No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Pork sausage.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You think I'm some sort of savage? People talk about phantom limbs.
s03e10	Mhysa	 An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.
s03e10	Mhysa	 So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock? Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch? Sorry.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I shouldn't make jokes.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But my father taught me to aim for their head.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Kill me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Sorry, what? Kill me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A little louder.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Kill me! You're no good to me dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We need you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.
s03e10	Mhysa	 That's a name for a lord.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Stinking meat.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You reek.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Reek! That's a good name for you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What's your name? Theon Greyjoy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What's your name? Th-- Theon Greyjoy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Please.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What is your name?! Reek.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My name is Reek.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Don't kill me! - Who are you? - Sam! Sam! - Who are you?! Gilly.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Don't hurt us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Where are you going? To Castle Black.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - My brother, he's in the Night's-- - Shush.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Who's your brother? - Doesn't matter.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're Jon's brother.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The one who fell from the window.
s03e10	Mhysa	 No, I'm not.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And I've heard all about Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If you're his brother, you're my brother, too.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And anything I can do to help you, I will.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Take us north of the Wall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What? Why in the world would you want to go-- I don't want to.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I have to.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How did you get through the Wall? Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here? Come with us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Hodor can carry you to the top.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Come with us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 There's nothing north but death.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It's the safest place for you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 There's nowhere safe any longer.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You know that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What I know is what I saw.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How do you know all that? The Night's Watch can't stop them.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But you're going to stop them? Please, Sam.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I have to go north.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I have to.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home.
s03e10	Mhysa	 On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
s03e10	Mhysa	 In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He cried when I took it away from him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.
s03e10	Mhysa	" Get that out of my sight.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Theon disobeyed my orders.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The boy is a fool.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He cannot further the Greyjoy line.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Get this away from me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's your son.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Son? He's not a man anymore.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's your son.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's my brother.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's a Greyjoy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Watch yourself.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I've made my decision.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And I've made mine.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Get those ropes! I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What is it? Dragonglass.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We found them at the Fist.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Someone buried them a long time ago.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Someone wanted us to find them.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Why? What are they for? Killing white walkers.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How do you know that? The walker came for my baby.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And Sam But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Take it, Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And the archer.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I got lucky with one of them.
s03e10	Mhysa	 There are more.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Many more.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I wish you'd come with us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I wish I could.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I really do.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How are you keeping? Great.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Never better.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It was just a bit of blood.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I should have known.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - I'm not a highborn.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - She called you Ser.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I heard it.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A recent state of affairs.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Sure, you were.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're my friend.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're here to help.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I lived below the Street of Flour.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you? The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door - on Gin Alley.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Gin Alley.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You lived in the fancy part of town.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And here we are now.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Yeah, we've come a long way.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We're all the same, really.
s03e10	Mhysa	 She went to great pains to point that out to me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her? You're me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Never been with a woman.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Never talked to a woman, really.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And then she comes at you-- big words, no clothes.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What would you have done? She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 So how'd you become a lord? Oh, that's a long story.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Better not, then.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm a bit busy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He rewarded me with a lordship.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And this.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You see? Highborns.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I didn't want to be a lord.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I nearly didn't accept.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Why did you? I did it for my son.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I wanted him to have a better life.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Does he? He's dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How'd he die? Following me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 When did you come to this strange country? When I was 13.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You were only a child.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I stopped being a child when I was nine.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My mother made sure of that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Now it's just the drinking.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And now I'm his wife's servant.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
s03e10	Mhysa	 She is a sweet young thing.
s03e10	Mhysa	 None of this is her fault.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I love that girl.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I would kill for her.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Do you think that makes it easier for me? No, I expect not.
s03e10	Mhysa	 She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-- - I have a name.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - You have one name.
s03e10	Mhysa	 As do I.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Here only the family name matters.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What do you want from me, Lord Varys? Diamonds.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Get on one of those ships.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Hire servants.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Start a new life, a good life, far from here.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The mysterious foreign beauty.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You'll have suitors lining up.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Why do you want me to leave? Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And you-- you are a complication.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I know you love him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm not asking you to leave him for money.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 This will never be your home, my lady.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Lord Varys.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Keep up.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I don't think I can, my lord.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It's not easy being drunk all the time.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Everyone would do it if it were easy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Leave.
s03e10	Mhysa	 So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.
s03e10	Mhysa	 She doesn't deserve this.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Deserve? Be careful with that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
s03e10	Mhysa	 There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit? I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're not me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
s03e10	Mhysa	 So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it? So she can have some happiness in her life.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You have children.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How happy would you say you are? Not very.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.
s03e10	Mhysa	 They're the reason I'm alive.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Even Joffrey? Even Joffrey.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He was all I had once.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Before Myrcella was born.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I used to spend hours looking at him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 His wisps of hair.
s03e10	Mhysa	 His tiny little hands and feet.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He was such a jolly little fellow.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "We should have known.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Even then we should have known.
s03e10	Mhysa	" It's nonsense.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Whenever he was with me, he was happy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey-- how it feels to have someone.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Someone of your own.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How long does it go on? Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'm telling you, that's what she did.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Sounded like a cow in heat.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Aye, not for long.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - That's right.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Black Walder shut her up right quick.
s03e10	Mhysa	 None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'll tell you what, though.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - You sewed it on? - I did.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It was me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And Malcolm and Talbott.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Took the skin right with it.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Give it a nice firm mooring and-- What do you want? - Mind if I keep warm? - Fuck off.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But I'm hungry.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Does fuck off mean something different where you're from? I've got money.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What kind of coin is that? It's worth a lot.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Sorry.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Little shit.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Fool! Where did you get the knife? From you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Is that the first man you've killed? The first man.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Valar morghulis.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You always knew who I was, what I am.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I have to go home now.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I know you won't hurt me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I do know some things.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I know I love you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I know you love me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But I have to go home now.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I know how this must look.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - What I meant was-- - I swear to you, my lord-- I'm not a lord, my dear.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Not for many, many years.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Among other things.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What is your name? Gilly.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Ah, for the gillyflower.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Lovely.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Yes, my-- Maester.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Master.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Maester.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And the child? She hasn't chosen a name yet.
s03e10	Mhysa	 His name is Sam.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order? He's not my child, Maester Aemon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 She's one of Craster's wives.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I remember every word of the oath.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Night gathers and my watch begins.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The realms of men.
s03e10	Mhysa	 That means her as well as us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We didn't build The night is gathering, Maester Aemon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I've seen it.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It's coming for all of us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Thank you Maester.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I can cook and clean and I can-- Good.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Miles better.
s03e10	Mhysa	 We had 44 ravens at last count.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Make sure they're all fed.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Every one of them flies tonight.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Invaded-- inv-- invit-- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit--" Night.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "First night of the full moon.
s03e10	Mhysa	" Why is there a G in night? I don't know.
s03e10	Mhysa	 There just is.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Well, your father's not going to go to that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My books are better than these boring scrolls.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You could read about Balerion the Dread.
s03e10	Mhysa	 They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'd like to see that someday.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "His fangs were as long as bastard swords.
s03e10	Mhysa	" Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The king does not have time for this drudgery.
s03e10	Mhysa	 "To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.
s03e10	Mhysa	" - Noblemen.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - "Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig-- the Night's Watch implores" What is it? Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked? Stay here.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Bar the door.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The usurper Robb Stark is dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Betrayed by his bannerman.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire? I take no credit.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Your Grace, the world has got so far bent.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It is evil.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And you are not an evil man.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos? Aegon Targaryen.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros? On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.
s03e10	Mhysa	 My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I will not forget that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I will not forgive that.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You do not need to burn the boy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-- And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
s03e10	Mhysa	 His name is Gendry.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's a good lad.
s03e10	Mhysa	 A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom? Everything.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The boy must die.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - What are you doing? - You're leaving.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Is this some kind of trick? Yes, but not on you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Aim for that star.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Don't stop.
s03e10	Mhysa	 There's bread and water.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Go slow with it.
s03e10	Mhysa	 If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I know not to drink seawater.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You'll want to stop there.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Don't.
s03e10	Mhysa	 She'll find you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Where should I go? You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The gold cloaks are looking for me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 They were looking for me for 20 years.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Do they know your face? - No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The other way.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You ever been in a boat before? No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You know how to swim? No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Don't fall out.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Go on.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Why are you doing this? Because it's right.
s03e10	Mhysa	 And because I'm a slow learner.
s03e10	Mhysa	 When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Horse approaching! Halt! Halt! Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I don't think he can see us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Pyp? Sam? Hush, now.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're home.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Carry him inside.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Gently.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Out of the way.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Step aside, country boy.
s03e10	Mhysa	 People working here.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Cersei.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You don't deny it? No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I let him go.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Your mercy saved the boy's life.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You feel good about that? Aye, I do.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You saved one innocent.
s03e10	Mhysa	 How many tens of thousands have you doomed? There has got to be another way.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I don't know, Your Grace.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I can't see the future in the fire.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, - sentence you to die.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - I understand.
s03e10	Mhysa	 But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - You're gonna need me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Take him away.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Why am I gonna need you? My king.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Their Lord Commander is dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Took a ranging party north and never made it back.
s03e10	Mhysa	 One lad did, though.
s03e10	Mhysa	 What he saw beyond the Wall-- it's coming for all of us.
s03e10	Mhysa	 When did you learn to read? Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
s03e10	Mhysa	 This War of Five Kings means nothing.
s03e10	Mhysa	 The true war lies to the north, my king.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Death marches on the Wall.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Only you can stop him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You can't stop him alone.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.
s03e10	Mhysa	 I've made my decision.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He's right.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You need him.
s03e10	Mhysa	 He has a part to play in the war to come.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You're in his army now.
s03e10	Mhysa	 They will come, Your Grace.
s03e10	Mhysa	 When they're ready.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You didn't conquer them.
s03e10	Mhysa	 You liberated them.
s03e10	Mhysa	 People learn to love their chains.
s03e10	Mhysa	 _ _ _ _ _ No.
s03e10	Mhysa	 - Mhysa! - Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! What does it mean? It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi.
s03e10	Mhysa	 It means "mother.
s03e10	Mhysa	" It's all right.
s03e10	Mhysa	 These people won't hurt me.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Mhysa! Mhysa! _ Mhysa.
s03e10	Mhysa	 Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
s04e01	Two Swords	I want you to tell me the truth about Joffrey.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He's a monster.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The Tyrells beside us, no one will think of rebelling for another century.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Dontos of House Hollard.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You'll be my new fool! Thank you, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Do you know what it takes to unite 19 clans? I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Let us go, and my father will pay you whatever you want.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Enough to buy me a new hand? _ _ We need to find Sansa Stark a husband.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Tyrion'll do as he's bid, you'll marry Ser Loras.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - I am not some brood mare - You're my daughter! My feelings for you have not changed.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'm not your lady, I'm your whore.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He's a crow, he'll stab us in the back.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Kill him! That's a fine little blade.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - No! - Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Something wrong with your leg, boy? - You've got to carry me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Robb! The Lannisters send their regards! It's too late! - You know I didn't have a choice - You know nothing, Jon Snow! You're home.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( fire crackling ) ( "Rains of Castamere" playing ) ( footsteps approach ) ( hammering echoes ) ( theme music playing ) - Magnificent.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Mm-hmm.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Looks fresh-forged.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It is.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
s04e01	Two Swords	 There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The finest of them was in Volantis.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Where did you get this much Valyrian steel? From someone who no longer had need of it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - And now we have two.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Two? The original weapon was absurdly large.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Plenty of steel for two swords.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Well, thank you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It's glorious.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You'll have to train your left hand.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You'll never be as good.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Where's that written? I can and I will.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The Kingsguard oath is for life.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The war is over.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The king is safe.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The king is never safe.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike? Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They will continue to do so when you go home.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Home? - You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I am the King's Hand.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My place is here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You know what they call me? Kingslayer.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Oathbreaker.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Man without honor.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You won't be breaking anything.
s04e01	Two Swords	 There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The king will exercise that prerogative.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - No.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - No? No.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't believe I asked you a question.
s04e01	Two Swords	 There's my answer.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If you think your bloody honor comes before-- My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't want Casterly Rock.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't want a wife.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't want children.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What do you want? Supper would be nice.
s04e01	Two Swords	 For 40 years I've tried to teach you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If you haven't learned by now, you never will.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Go.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I suppose you want the sword back.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Keep it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( goats bleat ) How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat? Please don't.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Bronn: Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern.
s04e01	Two Swords	 That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.
s04e01	Two Swords	 This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him? There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Has been for years.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, - it may as well be yours, eh? - No need for cynicism.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Oh.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ah, here we are.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( claps ) Can you read the sigils? Yellow balls? Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House Blackmont.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I need a sigil.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear? I don't see it, my lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Well met, my lords.
s04e01	Two Swords	 His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Forgive me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't see Prince Doran in your company.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Will he? And where is Prince Oberyn? Arrived before dawn.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Very well.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You must be weary after such a long journey.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Some accomplished diplomacy that was.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Now where? We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big? You're famous for fucking half of Westeros.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go? I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Look at this one.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How lovely is she? Beautiful.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But pale.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They like them pale in the capital.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Shows they don't work the fields.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Do I frighten you? You like? Timid.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Timid bores me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're a bit of mischief, aren't you? I think she likes you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She has good taste.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're not timid, are you? ( laughs ) Not timid.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Do you like women? When they look like her, my lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	 This one will do nicely.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Olyvar: Very good, my lady.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Oh, I'm not a lady.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A term of courtesy in this establishment.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A lie anywhere.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She is a whore.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And you're what? A procurer.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Any of the others? The two girls can leave.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - ( snaps fingers ) - You stay.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Take off your clothes.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We'll be here a while.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - My lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - I am a prince, boy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Have you ever been with a prince? Can't say I have.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'm wildly expensive.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Take off your clothes.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Which way do you like it? - ( gasps ) - My way.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Man:  And so he spoke and so he spoke   That Lord of Castamere  -  And now the rains  - Oberyn.
s04e01	Two Swords	 -  Weep o'er his hall  - Oberyn, don't.
s04e01	Two Swords	  With no one there to hear   Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall   And not a soul to hear.
s04e01	Two Swords	  You lost, friend? Forgive me for staring.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We don't like the smell.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( laughs ) - Come with me, lover.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Gods, look at this one.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( laughs ) Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister? You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone.
s04e01	Two Swords	 May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( screams ) Longsword is a bad option in close quarters.
s04e01	Two Swords	 When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So many veins in the wrist.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( groans ) He'll live if you get him help straightaway.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So, decisions.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - We heard there might be - ( screams ) trouble.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Apologies, my love.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ellaria Sand, my paramour.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The king's own Uncle Imp.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If there's anything I can do to make your stay-- What are you? His hired killer? It started that way, aye.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Now I'm a knight.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How did that come to pass? Killed the right people, I suppose.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( laughs ) We'll need a few more girls.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Girls, yes? You don't partake? Oh, I partook.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Now I'm married.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private? Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Oh, they take all kinds.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Even Dornishmen.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Let us speak truth here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Joffrey is insulted.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I am only the second son after all.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( chuckles ) Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn? I was invited to the royal wedding.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I thought we were speaking truth.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The last time I was in the capital was many years ago.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Another wedding.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My sister loved him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She bore his children.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman.
s04e01	Two Swords	 That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city I wasn't actually present.
s04e01	Two Swords	 and butchered those children.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My nephew and niece.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And my sister, you know what they did to her? I'm asking you a question.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I've heard rumors.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( chuckles ) So have I.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I wasn't there.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't know what happened.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Tell your father I'm here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( dragons screeching ) ( growls ) ( screeching ) - ( growls ) - ( chuckles ) - ( screeches ) - Shh.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( screeching ) ( gasps ) Shh.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Shh.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - ( roars ) - ( gasps ) ( roars ) They're dragons, Khaleesi.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They can never be tamed.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Not even by their mother.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Ser Barristan.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm? Gambling, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Gambling? Crowd: Mhysa.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Mhysa.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Mhysa How long have they been at it? Since midnight, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What's the prize to winning this stupid contest? The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
s04e01	Two Swords	 That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( Daario groans ) _ _ _ _ _ You need to eat something.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Pigeon pie.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No, thank you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Lemon cakes? No, thank you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You love lemon cakes.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Tell her she needs to eat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lady, you do need to eat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't need to eat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She needs to eat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I can't let you starve.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I swore to protect you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lady, I am your husband.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Let me help you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How can you help me? I don't know, but I can try.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What happened to your family was a terrible crime.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I didn't know your brother.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She was a strong woman.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Sansa.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Your mother would want you to carry on.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You know it's true.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Of course.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Of course.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Prayer can be helpful, I hear.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't pray anymore.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lion.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I know.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I know.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We have come to a dangerous place.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been? Of course I haven't forgotten.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I want you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Don't you want me? Things are a bit tense right now.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What things? My nephew the king wants to murder me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My wife hates me because my father murdered her family.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You need to relax.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Don't you want to relax? - What's wrong? - I told you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - It's not a good time.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - It's never a good time.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - You have your child bride now.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Shae.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Do you love her? - Love her? I barely know her.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She's a child.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - She despises me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - That's not an answer.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Of course I don't love her.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You tried to ship me away.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ship you away? Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What in the world are you talking about? If you want me to leave, just say it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Say it! - Shh.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't know what you're talking about.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You want me to stay? ( groans ) A work of art, really.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The craftsmanship is excellent.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Such an ingrate.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Days? Better part of an afternoon.
s04e01	Two Swords	 There, how does that feel? Uh a hook would be more practical.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Elegant, I think.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Thank you for your help with the other matter.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - The symptoms have abated? - Gone completely.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Odd little man.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - I've grown rather fond of him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - ( door closes ) He's quite talented, you know? What symptoms? Symptoms that are not your concern.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You let him touch you? You jealous? I'm surprised.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You never let Pycelle near you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( laughs ) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Well, they smell like Pycelle.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You drink more than you used to.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Yes.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Why? Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It must have been traumatic for you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We suffered through a siege.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A rather short siege.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So Father disowned me today.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He can't disown you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're all he's got.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're forgetting Tyrion.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you? Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Not now.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - I want-- Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Something's changed.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Everything's changed.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same? What do you want me to apologize for? For leaving me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You think I wanted to be taken prisoner? Don't know what you wanted.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You weren't here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You left me alone.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Every day.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I murdered people so I could be here with you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - You took too long.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - I - What are you saying? - I'm saying you took too long.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( knocking ) - Come in.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Jaime: Go away.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Forgive me, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You told me to come at once if there was anything important.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You plan on killing all the crows yourself? Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter? We wait for Mance's orders.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Yeah, well, he's a liar.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He is? Shouldn't it be "he was"? You said you put three arrows in him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I did.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( whistles ) Thenns.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I fucking hate Thenns.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Mance sent you? - ( grunts ) - How did you find us? You came from the south, not the north.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Took a detour.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Got some supper from a village down that way.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall? Help yourself.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( chuckles ) Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Fat and lazy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Easier for us, hmm? You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too? I'll answer to Mance.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I won't answer to you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 She yours? I'm not anybody's.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Too scrawny.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Not like those crows at Castle Black.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Officer: Draw.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Loose.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Jon: Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He said, "Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
s04e01	Two Swords	" I was jealous of Robb my whole life.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( winces ) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He was better than me at everything-- fighting and hunting and riding and girls.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Gods, the girls loved him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I wanted to hate him, but I never could.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Sometimes I want to hate you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Well, you're better than me at everything.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Except reading.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They're-- they're ready for you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He's wanted to hang me for a while.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Now's his chance.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No one's going to hang you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You've done nothing wrong.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I've done plenty wrong.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand? Jon: I didn't murder him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What do you call that? He wanted me to kill him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A bastard son of a traitor.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What would you expect? The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He was my brother.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him Slynt: The free folk? Listen to him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He even talks like a wildling now.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Aye, I talk like a wildling.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I ate with the wildlings.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I climbed the Wall with the wildlings.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I-- I laid with a wildling girl.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You admit to breaking your vows, then? I do.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The law is the law.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The boy must die.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.
s04e01	Two Swords	 There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Impossible.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You can't get before they start killing each other.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He has giants fighting for him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( laughs ) Giants? Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser? I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And now you're here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You must not have been very good at your job.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How dare you?! There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I killed their warg and three others.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They shot me full of arrows.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen.
s04e01	Two Swords	 That's the truth.
s04e01	Two Swords	 All the truth.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go? None of us are free.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We are men of the Night's Watch.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Go on.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Yes, you are.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And I don't trust the bastard.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He told the truth.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power? I grew up in King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Olenna: No.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're a queen, not an ox.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You can't say no to everything.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Nonsense.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My little dears.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( girls laughing ) The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You watch that.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Even here, even with me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( footsteps approaching ) My word.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lady.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lady.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Please pardon me for interrupting.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My name is Brienne of Tarth.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We know who you are.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We've heard all about you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But hearing is one thing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You dare not refuse.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A shadow? A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared.
s04e01	Two Swords	 One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Joffrey is our king now.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I meant no offense.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And you've given none.
s04e01	Two Swords	 All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Boros will be stationed here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Your Grace? Yes, yes, one guard at the-- the thing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Go on.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I've always guarded the king himself, my lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ever since your absence.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn.
s04e01	Two Swords	 All very good.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't expect any trouble.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The people love their king.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They know who keeps them fed.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.
s04e01	Two Swords	 By my leave.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They know I saved the city.
s04e01	Two Swords	 They know I won the war.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The war's not won.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Not while Stannis lives.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My apologies, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I was rather busy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Busy getting captured.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So this is the famous "Book of Brothers"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Arthur Dayne.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The Sword of the Morning.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( chuckles ) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Duncan the Tall.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( laughs ) Four pages for Ser Duncan.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He must have been quite a man.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So they say.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ser Jaime Lannister.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( chuckles ) Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - There's still time.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that? I use my left hand now, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Makes for more of a contest.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Daenerys: Have you ever been to Meereen? Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And? They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You think the Great Masters are worried? If they're smart, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You were told to ride at the back of the train.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Yes, my queen.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But I need to speak to you about something important.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A matter of strategy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 All right, what is this matter of strategy? A dusk rose.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding? And this one's called lady's lace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Would you like to walk without shoes? You have to know a land to rule it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its people.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Dusk rose tea eases fever.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Everyone in Meereen knows that.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Especially the slaves who have to make the tea.
s04e01	Two Swords	 If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Strategy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Harpy's Gold.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No tea from this one.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Beautiful but poisonous.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You are a gambler, aren't you? Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( man shouts in Valyrian ) There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
s04e01	Two Swords	 How many miles are there between here and Meereen? Barristan: I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You don't need to see this.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You will do no such thing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I will see each and every one of their faces.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Remove her collar before you bury her.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Brienne: There she is.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Jaime: Yes, there she is.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - And? - You made a promise.
s04e01	Two Swords	 To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
s04e01	Two Swords	 To keep them safe.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Where do you think she is? My money's on dead.
s04e01	Two Swords	 There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Bit of a complication.
s04e01	Two Swords	 A complication does not release you from a vow.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here? Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Maybe you're a Lannister, too.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You've got the hair for it if not the looks.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( footsteps ) ( footsteps stop ) ( gasps ) - ( gasps ) - It's all right.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It's all right.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It's all right.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - You're drunk.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Yes.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I have good reason to be.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Once I was a knight.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Now I'm only a fool.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Don't you know me? Ser Dontos.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The king's nameday celebration.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'm sorry.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I should have remembered.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I can't accept your apology.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Anyone would have done the same.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But only you did.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I can never repay you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You gave me my life.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But this, this is worth more than my life.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It belonged to my mother and her mother before her.
s04e01	Two Swords	 House Hollard was strong once.
s04e01	Two Swords	 House on the rise.
s04e01	Two Swords	 That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I can't take it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't have anything else left.
s04e01	Two Swords	 That's all.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Take it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Wear it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Yeah.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( flies buzzing ) Arya: When am I going to get a horse of my own? The little lady wants a pony.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The little lady wants away from your stench.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Horses aren't easy to come by.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away? Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left? No.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're not very smart, are you? I'm not a thief.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you? A man's got to have a code.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My family's gone.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I've got no one.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You've got an aunt in the Vale.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Your rich Aunt Lysa.
s04e01	Two Swords	 After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Arya: I'm hungry.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're hungry.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Five horses, five men.
s04e01	Two Swords	 More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I know him.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The small one.
s04e01	Two Swords	 His name is Polliver.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( urinating ) He killed Lommy.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What the fuck's a Lommy? He was my friend.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He's still got it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Hound: Got what? My sword Needle.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Needle? Of course you named your sword.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Lots of people name their swords.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Lots of cunts.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What are you-- get back here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 My brother gave me that sword.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Get back here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - He killed my friend.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I don't care if he ate your friend.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We're not going in there.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - ( man laughing ) - Man: Come on, give it up.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( woman whimpering ) - Come here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - ( whimpering ) - Let's have a feel there.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Leave it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - ( laughing ) - Come here.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Please, she's a good girl.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I know you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're the Hound.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Pour our new friend some ale.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What brings you so far north? I could ask the same of you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 What are you doing up here? Just keeping the king's peace.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No need.
s04e01	Two Swords	 The war's over.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So I've heard.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Robb Stark killed at the Twins.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Meaning no offense.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - None taken.
s04e01	Two Swords	 He's good, the Mountain is.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Best at what he does.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But torture, torture, torture, torture.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Drains the fun right out of it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And what's life without a little fun? ( chuckles ) But I don't need to tell you that, eh? She's all right.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I've had better.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( laughs ) You know what? You should come with us.
s04e01	Two Swords	 His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Gold, silver, more daughters.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Always something if you know how to make them talk.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You could do well for yourself.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We certainly have been.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'm not going to King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Think about it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We could do whatever we like wherever we go.
s04e01	Two Swords	 These are the king's colors.
s04e01	Two Swords	 No one's standing in his way now.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Which means no one's standing in ours.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Fuck the king.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( chatter stops ) When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - But here you are.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - Here I am.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Bring me one of those chickens.
s04e01	Two Swords	 - You got money to pay for it? - You paid for it? ( laughs ) No.
s04e01	Two Swords	 But we're the king's men.
s04e01	Two Swords	 So, you got money? Not a penny.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I'll still take that chicken.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Tell you what.
s04e01	Two Swords	 We'll trade you.
s04e01	Two Swords	 One of our little chickens for one of yours.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Give us a go at your friend.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( men chuckle ) You're a talker.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Ah.
s04e01	Two Swords	 And hungry.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Think I'll take two chickens.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You don't seem to understand the situation.
s04e01	Two Swords	 I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You lived your life for the king.
s04e01	Two Swords	 You're gonna die for some chickens? Someone is.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( shouts ) ( whimpering ) ( grunting ) ( groans ) ( screams ) ( screaming ) ( gasping ) ( grunts ) ( groans ) ( screams ) ( groans ) Something wrong with your leg, boy? What? What do you mean? Can you walk? I've got to carry you? Carry me? Fine little blade.
s04e01	Two Swords	 Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
s04e01	Two Swords	 ( gasps ) ( gurgling )
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! There you are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I can't see her, Ramsay.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Tansy! If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run! - Tansy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Where is she?  Tansy, Tansy, Tansy! Good girls.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Down, girls.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Well done.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You, too.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - I only wounded her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - You brought her down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 That's what matters.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A fine shot.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Wasn't it, Reek? A fine shot, master.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Please, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It hurts.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Oh, sweet.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Don't cry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It will be over soon.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She thinks she's pretty.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Let me put one through her face.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We have to reward the hounds, love.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 They did all the hard work.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Why? I did whatever you asked.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But you made Myranda feel jealous.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Me jealous of her? -  My lord, please.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Rip her! Rip her! Rip her! Not so pretty now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Wouldn't you agree, Pod? Is it solid gold? Gilded steel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're not eating.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - I'm not hungry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - You lost a hand, not a stomach.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Try the boar.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A toast.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 To the proud Lannister children.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Oh! - I'll clean it up.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No, I'll do it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Leave us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It's only wine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I can't fight anymore.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What about your left? I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass? You're the Lord Commander now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Command.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Let others do the fighting.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 When was the last time Father used a sword? I'm not Father.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm the Kingslayer.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 When people find out I can't slay a pigeon Train, then.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Learn to fight with your other hand.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 With whom? You? Men talk.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You need a proper, discreet swordsman.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 As it happens, I have just the one.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Unusual talent for a sellsword.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Is this place safe? There's this knight, Leygood, - got thunderbolts on his shield.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Uh-huh.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Right here is where I fuck his wife.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She's a screamer, that one.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I've never seen Valyrian steel before.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She's a beauty.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Best time to attack a man.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Mind yourself.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - If I still had my right hand - Plan on growing it back? Come on, then.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Open the gates! Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to! Father.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Welcome home.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A pleasure, Mother.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Hello.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And take Lady Walda to her chambers.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 This way, my lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Where is your prize? With the hounds.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'll have a look at him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Word travels.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How he screamed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You would have loved it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Father.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What did you do to him? I trained him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He was a slow learner, but he learned.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You flayed him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Peeled a few bits.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Removed a few others.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We've been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The flayed man is on our banners.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My banners, not yours.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're not a Bolton.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're a Snow.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Tywin Lannister has given me the North.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But he won't lift a finger to help me take it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I already asked.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lord Greyjoy refused.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Savages have no-- You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent? You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I acted.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I needed Theon.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I needed him whole.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Theon was our enemy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But Reek, Reek will never betray us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I placed far too much trust in you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? -  It's disrespectful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - I'm sorry, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Give him the razor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter? Go on, Reek.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A nice close shave.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark? I don't know, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	  Reek, did you murder the Stark boys? No, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Just two farm boys.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And crisped them so no one would know.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Yes, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The Starks have always ruled the North.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Oh, that's right, Reek.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Robb Stark is dead.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Sorry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I know he was like a brother to you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But my father put a knife through his heart.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How do you feel about that? - You ready for a hunt? - Always.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Find those boys and I'll give you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell? Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Who the fuck is Jon Snow? Their bastard brother.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He could be sheltering them.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He may know where they are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Could be a threat.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Bring this creature of yours.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Maybe he'll be of some use.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lord Varys.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Breakfasting with the king? I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Oh, to be foreign.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Ahem.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Shae has been noticed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Sansa's maid saw you with her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She already told your sister.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No, I will not.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No legendary brother to avenge me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Only little birds who whisper in my ear.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No one weeps for spiders or whores.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I have friends across the sea who could help her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She won't leave.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat? From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A handsome goblet, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Or shall I call you Father? I shall be honored, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She's the whore I told you about.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The dark-haired one.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A book? "The Lives of Four Kings.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A book every king should read.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Thank you, Uncle.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Careful, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 So they say.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Such a great sword should have a name.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - What shall I call her? -  Stormbringer.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Terminus.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Widow's Wail.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Wolfsbane.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Widow's Wail.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I like that.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Don't.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You want me on the desk? -  What's wrong, my lion? - Don't call me that.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What should I call you? I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Our friendship? There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What? You'll have your own cabin, of course, and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What is this? I'm a married man.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I need to uphold my vows.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She doesn't want you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 -  I need to do right by her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - You don't want her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 By our children.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - What are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You are afraid of your father and your sister.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - You're going to run from them all your life? - I need you to leave.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm not afraid of them.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm not going to run.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Shae.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - We will fight them together.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I can't be in love with a whore.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I can't have children with a whore.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How many men have you been with? How many whores have you been with? I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But now that time is over.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Bronn will escort you to your ship.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Hear us now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Sire, I served you well.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lord of Light, show us the way Selyse, you're my sister! Yours are the stars that guide us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Tell him! Tell him! Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Did you see? Their souls.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It was their souls.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Our lord took them.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Did you see? Lord Florent was your brother by law.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He was an infidel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 They were the gods of your fathers, too.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I ordered him to tear down his idols.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He disobeyed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How many ships did he bring to your cause? How many men? A good deal more than you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Their sins all burned away.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Did you see? I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Meat's off.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Our larders are almost empty.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Serve fish, then.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We're on an island.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You hate fish.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The binding glue is made from horses.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Do you remember? - Of course I remember.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Have you ever known true hunger, my lady? It's all I knew when I was a child.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Until you found the Lord of Light? Until he found me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I fear for our daughter's soul.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Every mother should fear for her child's soul.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - She's a stubborn little beast.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - She's a child.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You barely know her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 She's my daughter.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You will not strike her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 As you command.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Come in.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Were you sleeping, Princess? Did you watch the ceremony on the beach? I heard it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And it frightened you? Ser Axel was my uncle.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He was always kind to me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 They're in a better place now, Princess.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But they screamed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Women scream when they give birth.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Afterward they are filled with joy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I was much like you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Only I wasn't a princess.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And you didn't have this.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What do you know of the gods? I read "The Seven-Pointed Star.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	" Lies and fables.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Septons speak of seven gods.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 There are but two-- a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Eternally at war.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 There are no seven heavens and no seven hells? There's only one hell, Princess.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The one we live in now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	  Hodor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Why did you wake me? You've been gone for hours.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I was hungry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We're all hungry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I was just eating.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Summer was eating.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're not a direwolf, Bran.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Must be glorious, though.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 To run, to leap, to hunt.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 To be whole.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You'd forget us, Bran.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You'd forget your mother and father.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You'd forget your brothers and sisters.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You'd forget Winterfell.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You'd forget you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And if we lose you, we lose everything.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Hodor, take me to the tree.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Look for me beneath the tree.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	  He saw us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 North.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I know where we have to go.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 With this kiss, I pledge my love.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We have a new queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Better her than you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Bit much, wouldn't you say? - It feels proportionate.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Proportionate to what? - The expected extravagance.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You ought to try enjoying something before you die.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You might find it suits you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Not now, Mace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lord Tywin and I are speaking.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm paying my share.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity? No, your heartfelt thank-you is its own reward.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Wars are rather expensive.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 "The Iron Bank will have its due.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	" How they love to remind everyone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We both know you're smarter than that.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 All taken care of.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - You saw her board the ship? - Aye, she's on it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You saw the ship sail away? No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How do you know? Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 There's someone following you? She's gone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I know you don't want to believe it, but she is.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Hello.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Hello.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Not you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You look exquisite, child.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The wind has been at you, though.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You must excuse me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	  A coat of gold   Or a coat of red   A lion still has claws   And mine, my lord  Very good.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Very good.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Off you go.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My love, why don't we make the announcement? Everyone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The queen would like to say a few words.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Not all among us are so lucky.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're an example to us all.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Ser Loras, it's quite all right.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your sister looks very beautiful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 As does yours.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 So, looking forward to your wedding? Yes, very much.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 They certainly are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Perhaps they should get married.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And neither will you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - My queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Lady Brienne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 So good of you to come.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm no lady, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Did you just bow? Apologies, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I never did master the curtsy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 That's not true, my love.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Brienne had nothing to do with it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A shame.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The country has been at war too long.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Yes, yes.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Thank you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I hope we see more of you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lady Brienne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 As you say, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I owe you my gratitude.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 More than once.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm sure you have many fascinating stories.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Sworn to Renly Baratheon.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Sworn to Catelyn Stark.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 And now my brother.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But you love him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - She'll do no such thing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Oh, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice-- You should see Qyburn.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He's quite good.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Qyburn? Deplorable man.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs? Your Grace, I am a man of learning.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me? I never meant to annoy anyone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 But you are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You annoy me right now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 So here's what I want you to do.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I want you to leave my presence.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Leave this wedding right now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your Grace, Queen Margaery-- The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're in rather a good mood.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - I suppose I am.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - I won't ask why.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Small pleasures.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lord Tywin.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Prince Oberyn.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I don't believe you have met Ellaria.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, - Ellaria Sand.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - My lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Charmed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We are everywhere in Dorne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No? How tolerant of you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Please give him our regards.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 They call it the rich man's disease.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A wonder you don't have it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 People everywhere have their differences.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 There's been too much amusement here today.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A royal wedding is not an amusement.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A royal wedding is history.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My lords my ladies I give you King Joffrey Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 The War of the Five Kings.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm the rightful king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - King in the North! - Yes!  Traitor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 You're a traitor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 For the Seven Kingdoms! Let the war begin.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Renly, you're no king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Away, degenerate.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Away.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Away.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Ooh, careful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Go on.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - I want you to be my prince.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Stannis! Who's got the gold now, Stark? I am the rightful king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Challenge me, ruffian.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Take that.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - I'm drowning.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I'm drowning.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I am the King in the North! Not wildfire! Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Yes, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Charge! Ready, again.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I am the King in the North! - Charge! - Charge! Yes!  Your head! Fine gentlemen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Well fought.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Well fought.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Here you are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Champion's purse.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Uncle.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I would like to keep what remains of my face.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I think you should fight him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I speak as a firsthand witness.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Be careful, though.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 This one is clearly mad with lust.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 A fine vintage.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Shame that it spilled.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It did not spill.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My love, come back to me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It's time for my father's toast.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Your Grace does me a great honor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 It's not meant as an honor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Bring me my goblet.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Kneel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Kneel before your king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Kneel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 I said kneel! Look, the pie.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Wonderful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Wonderful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 My hero.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Can we leave now? - Let's find out.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Uncle.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember? I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No, no, no.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No, you're perfect the way you are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Serve me my wine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Well, hurry up.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 This pie is dry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Mm, good.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Needs washing down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 No, you'll wait here un-- Your Grace? It's nothing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - He's choking! - Help the poor boy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Idiots, help your king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 - Move away! - Joffrey! Joffrey! - Help him! - Someone help him! - Joffrey! - Come with me now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 -  Joffrey! Joffrey! If you want to live, we have to leave.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Don't touch him! Joffrey.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Please, Joffrey.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Joffrey, what is it? Help him! My son.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	  He's gone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Our king is gone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He did this.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 He poisoned my son, your king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Take him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	 Take him! Take him! Take him!  In a coat of gold   Or a coat of red   A lion still has claws   And mine are long   And sharp, my lord   As long and sharp as yours   And so he spoke and so he spoke   That Lord of Castamere   And now the rains   Weep o'er his hall   With no one there to hear   Yes, now the rains   Weep o'er his hall   And not a soul to hear.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	You did this.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You did this! - We have to leave.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Take him! Take him! Where is his wife? Where's Sansa? Find her.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Bar the gates of the city.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Seize every ship in the harbor.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Where is she?! - No one leaves the capital! No one! - Get in.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Where are we going? Somewhere safe.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Up you go, my lady.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You'll be fine.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're stronger than you know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Lord Baelish? - Petyr.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Are you hurt, my lady? Good.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Good.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Rest easy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - The worst is past.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Lord Baelish.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I promised I'd get her to you safely.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Softly, my friend.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Voices carry over water.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 First you'll want your pay.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - 10,000 was it? - 10,000.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Wait! Shh.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You don't want the queen to hear, do you? are searching for you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king? - I didn't murder anyone.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But you must admit it looks suspicious.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Why did you kill him? Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He saved me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Every one of them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And he did it all for gold.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Money buys a man's silence for a time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A bolt in the heart buys it forever.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He was helping me because I saved his life.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The last legacy of House Hollard.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I had it made a few weeks ago.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What did I once tell you about the capital? We're all liars here.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Come, my lady.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I know you've had a difficult day.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But you're safe now.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I promise you that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're safe with me and sailing home.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 So am I the queen? More than you were with Renly.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make it stop-- it was horrible.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The world is overflowing with horrible things.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But they're all a tray of cakes next to death.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What was it like? They took me to the Great Hall and there he was.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The man I'd married and suffered to father my children.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There he was lying on a table.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I must be cursed.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Nonsense.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your circumstances have improved markedly.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But I would have been the queen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You did wonderful work on Joffrey.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The next one should be easier.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your brother is dead.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Do you know what that means? I'm not trying to trick you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It means I'll become king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yes, you will become king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What kind of king do you think you'll be? A good king? Mm, I think so as well.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You've got the right temperament for it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality? This is hardly the place or the time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Holiness? Hmm.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Baelor the Blessed was holy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And pious.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He built this sept.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Justice.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yeah.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A good king must be just.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Orys I was just.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Everyone applauded his reforms.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Nobles and commoners alike.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But he wasn't just for long.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize? - No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - What about strength? - Yes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Strength.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 King Robert was strong.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What do they all lack? - Wisdom.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Yes! Wisdom is what makes a good king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers? - No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Of course not.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're young.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your brother was not a wise king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your brother was not a good king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Now, as the king, you will have to marry.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Do you understand why? A king needs a queen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yes, but why? To further the family line.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Do you know how that happens? - Yes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you? I don't think so.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's all relatively straightforward.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - How are you? - I'm all right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You are.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You will be.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'll see to that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Yes, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - All of you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It was Tyrion.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He killed him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He told me he would.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 "A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	" That's what he said to me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You saw it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You saw Joff point at him just before he-- I don't know what I saw.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Avenge him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Avenge our son.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Kill Tyrion.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Tyrion's my brother.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Our brother.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There'll be a trial.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We'll get to the truth of what happened.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I don't want a trial.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I want him dead.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Please, Jaime.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You have to.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He was our son.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Our baby boy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're a hateful woman.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman? Jaime, not here, please.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Please.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Stop it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Stop it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Stop.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Stop it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Stop.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Stop.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Stop.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's not right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's not right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's not right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I don't care.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Don't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I don't care.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Don't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Jaime, don't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I don't care.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Gonna rain soon.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Where are we? Near Fairmarket, I think.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You think? You don't have a map? - No, I don't have a map.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Maybe we should get one.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 How far is it to the Eyrie? Far.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And you're sure we're going the right way? Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Get my gold, be on my way.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - On your way where? - Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Fight as a sellsword.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Second Sons, could be.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Seems like a good fit for me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'd like to see Braavos one day.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Why Braavos? I have friends there.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I doubt it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Seven blessings to you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What do you want? What do I want? This is my land.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 If I'm standing on it, it's my land.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We were just watering the horses.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We'll be on our way.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Forgive my father.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He was wounded fighting in the war.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He's never been the same.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Which house did he fight for? The Tullys of Riverrun.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There's a storm coming.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You'll be wanting a roof tonight.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There's fresh hay in the barn.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You got to do all seven of the fuckers? Father! We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm so sorry.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Really good.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Did you fight at the Twins? - Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The Red Wedding they're calling it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He offered them guest right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Guest right don't mean much anymore.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It means something to me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The gods will have their vengeance.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We had good years and bad years, same as anyone.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But we were safe.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The whole country's gone sour.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You got any ale? Afraid not.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 How can a man not keep ale in his home? You look like you could really swing that sword.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A real warrior with proper training.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Meaning no offense.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What'll you pay? I don't have much.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Fair wages for fair work? Fair wages for fair work.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - What did you do?! - Get your horse saddled.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - You told me you weren't a thief.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I wasn't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He took us in.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He fed us and you-- Aye, he took us in.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And they'll both be dead come winter.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - You don't know that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I do know it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He's weak.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He can't protect himself.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They'll both be dead come winter.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Dead men don't need silver.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There's plenty worse than me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I just understand the way things are.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out? Raper.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Raper.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Horse thief.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Ninth born son.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Raper.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Thief.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Thief and raper.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There he is, Sam the Slayer.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Going to visit your wildling whore? - She's not a whore.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They all think I'm lying.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 About what? Killing the white walker.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're not lying.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'll never forget the way it screamed.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But you're the only one that saw it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And they all think you're just a-- A what? Well, a wildling.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 My father hated that word.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's not a very nice word, I suppose.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I don't know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it? So are you all right? No one bothering you? I get a lot of looks.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I hear them making their jokes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I worry about it sometimes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 All the time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Why do you worry about it? They've got other things to think about.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 That's the only thing they think about.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - You're being silly.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I'm not being silly.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What about you? What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Thank you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 For what? For worrying about me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I don't know if you're safe here.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Some of them were rapers.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You saw what they did at your father's keep.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 So what are you saying? Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Are you bored of me? Bored of you? I I want to protect you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'll get these to Hobb.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Keep an eye on little Sam.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your Grace.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're a literary man now.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What do you make of that? - Joffrey? - The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A leech filled with bastard blood.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A bastard you set free.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I will find you an army, Your Grace.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I've been working day and night-- - What progress have you made? I've rallied House Peasebury to your cause.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 House Peasebury.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - House Musgood.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - House Musgood.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - And House Haigh.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - House Haigh.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Westeros is not the world, Your Grace.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We need to look east for ships and men.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 fight for the Golden Company.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - The Golden Company? - They've never broken a contract.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They're sellswords.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Soldiers win wars.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Soldiers on the ground.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's dirty on the ground.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We don't have any gold.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Not yet.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I will not become a page in someone else's history book.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm running out of time, Ser Davos.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Which means you're running out of time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're late.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm sorry, Princess.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I thought you weren't coming.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say "ka-nigit.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	" That happened once, weeks ago.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're your father's daughter, no mistake.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Bloody relentless, the both of you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's a new one today.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Lots of tricky words.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But I think you can manage.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You'll never read well if you move your lips.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 That's how children do it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 "The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas First Sword of Braavos.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	" Thank you very much.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I like this one.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's full of sword fights and pirates.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You were a pirate once.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 No, I was never a pirate.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I was a smuggler.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What's the difference? Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 My father says a criminal is a criminal.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 So do the Braavosi.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - You've sailed to Braavos? - Of course.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction-- - What was that for? - I need you to write a message.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You should write it yourself.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's good practice.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's too important for me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I need a smart person to do it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Go on.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But that's not you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I need to get their attention.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Go on.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Write.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He's seen some adventures, hasn't he? - Precious little thing.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Thank you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - What's his name? - Sam.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Lovely.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 That the daddy? No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Where's the daddy? He's dead.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Oh.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Where you from? North of here.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 North of here? You a fucking wildling? - Only room and board? - That's right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Could find other work for her, too.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - No other work.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - There'd be money.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Give you a piece of it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 No other work.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I promise to come back and visit whenever I can.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You'll be safer here.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me? You protected me north of the Wall.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 This is different.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You have to trust me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's for the best.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Best for you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Oh, Gilly.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Please don't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Greedy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 No? I'm sorry.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're calling my beauty an acquired taste? That's quite all right, lover.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 It's more for you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your loss.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You like them both the same? - Boys and girls? - Does that surprise you? Everyone has a preference.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The gods made that and it delights me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The gods made this and it delights me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What are you, 25? Children.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 That pretty ass of yours will sag.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 No one will want you anymore.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Did you? He is a prince of Dorne.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They will all have to line up behind you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Prince Oberyn.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Lord Tywin.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 May we have the room? Call my name if you need me, lover.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Would you like to sit? No, thank you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Some wine? No, thank you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - I'm sorry about your grandson.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Are you? I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Or his grandfather.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 An awful way to die.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Which way is that? Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin? Some believe the king choked.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The king was poisoned.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I did.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 This is why I know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Your hatred for my family is rather well known.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Rather suspicious.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon? You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What did you discuss? You think we conspired together? What did you discuss? The death of my sister.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 For which you blame me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 She was raped and murdered by the Mountain.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The Mountain follows your orders.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Of course I blame you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Should I be concerned? You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I am a man of reason.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 So you deny involvement in Elia's murder? Categorically.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I would like to speak with the Mountain.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I could arrange for this meeting.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But you want something in return.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There will be a trial for my son.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I will preside.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I would like you to be the third.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Why? Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Declared themselves enemies of the throne.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Now they are our strongest allies.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The king is dead.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A wildling army marches on the Wall.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We need each other.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Podrick.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Apologies for the stench.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A noble effort.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They didn't find the candles, though.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're a good lad.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Any word of Shae? I've heard nothing, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I suppose that's a good thing.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What are they saying about me out there? You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Do you believe I murdered Joffrey? No, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You didn't? No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Gods, no.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Trial in a fortnight.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Have they announced the judges yet? - Your father.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Of course.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Mace Tyrell.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Oberyn? Give it to my father.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Anyone who might testify on your behalf.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Very well, my wife.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Sansa.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 My lord, she's gone.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Gone? No one's seen her since the wedding.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You don't think she No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Podrick.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Yes, my lord? - They'll be following you now.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Who will? I don't know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The ominous they.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 The man pulling the strings.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Or woman.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 My father.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Any other witnesses, my lord? Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Of course.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Fetch Bronn.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I have a job for him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I've already asked, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - They won't let him see you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Why not? They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He's under investigation himself.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime? I'll ask, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There's something else, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What did you tell him? I didn't tell them anything, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Are you going to accept their offer? My lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You've been good to me, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They'll want an answer before that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I already gave them an answer, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I will not have you dying on my behalf.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - My lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Pod, I am giving you an order.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Go and find my brother.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Tell him I need him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Pod! This is farewell.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Farewell, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Pod.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There has never lived a more loyal squire.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Mother says it's time to eat.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What's she got boiling? Wait.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Wait.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Let me guess.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Potatoes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Potatoes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Has she got-- The wildlings! Guymon! Hide.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Hide! You know how to get to Castle Black? Yes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Those your parents? Open your eyes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm going to eat them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Aye! Aye! Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Seems like that would be a good lesson.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Aye! If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We have just over And that's including stewards and builders.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We can't afford to lose a single man.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We must remember our first responsibility.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We are the watchers on the Wall.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 There's got to be a way to protect them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition? Mance Rayder is coming.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 miles before they reach an army that can stop them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 That is our job.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Rangers returning.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Help him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What took you so long? - We were held up.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - By what? Chains.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - And the mutineers stayed? - They're not going anywhere.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They've got Craster's food and his wives.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Poor girls.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Never thought they'd miss their daddy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Karl's running things now.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We need to ride north and kill them all.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 We just went over this, boy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - Justice can wait.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 - It's not about justice.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I told the wildlings we had over Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Then he'll throw his full strength at us.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Are they attacking? A single rider.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 A champion of Meereen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They want you to send your own champion against him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 What is he doing? I believe he means to He says that we're an army of men without man parts.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who hides his cock in his own asshole.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Ignore him, Your Grace.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 These are meaningless words.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I have something to say to the people of Meereen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 First, I will need this one to be quiet.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Do I have a champion? Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Which is why you must remain by my side.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Let me stand for you today as well.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I will not gamble with your life.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I was the last to join your army.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 My mother was a whore.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 I come from nothing.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 And before long, I will return to nothing.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Let me kill this man for you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Very well.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You have quite an audience.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Make it worth their while.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 He is very brave, Your Grace.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 You sure you don't want a horse? Why would I want a horse? Horses are faster than men.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	 Horses are dumber than men.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	My name is Grey Worm.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I come from the Summer "Ills.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	" Isles.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Summer Isles.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Summer Isles.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I am from an island called Naath.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 When they took you? "When did they take me?" I was five years old.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You remember your home? I remember when they rowed us away from shore.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 How white the beaches were.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 How tall the trees.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And I remember my village burning.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Smoke rising into the sky.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Do you remember your home? Unsullied.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Always Unsullied.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Before Unsullied, nothing.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 That's not true.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I don't want return.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Kill the masters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Kill the masters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 How are the lessons coming? Very well, Your Grace.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Missandei is teacher good, my queen.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You'll have to continue later.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's time.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts? Yes, that was it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 All these people, they're your subjects now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I will answer injustice with justice.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What the hell was that? That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You're a rare talent.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 When you're fighting cripples, anyway.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You learned to fight like a good little boy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You want to fight pretty or you want to win? You talk to my brother this way? All the time.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He got used to it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Do you think he did it? No.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But who didn't? And poison's not his style.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Or murder, for that matter.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him? You haven't been to see him yet, eh? We're done for today.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service? You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Aye.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You were his first choice.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You gonna fight for him now? To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Four walls.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A pot to piss in.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Is that supposed to make me feel better? Maybe a bit.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's complicated, yes.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - So how is our sister? - How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Her son? Don't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You know what's coming? My trial for regicide.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Yes, I know.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And that judge is my father.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Now that you mention it, she did ask.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 So, should I turn around and close my eyes? Depends.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Did you do it? The Kingslayer brothers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You like it? I like it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You're really asking if I killed your son? Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you? Well, you could set me free.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You know I can't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Then there's really nothing else to say.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Sorry, I'd forgotten.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Freeing you is treason.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Except I didn't do it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Which is why we're having a trial.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A trial.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 She won't rest until my head's on a spike.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Not just yours.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Sansa couldn't have done this.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died? No, but Sansa's not a killer.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Not yet, anyway.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Where are you taking me? I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 She's waiting for us at the Eyrie.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You'll be safe there.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Did you kill Joffrey? Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I know it was you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And who helped me with this conspiracy? Well, there was Ser Dontos.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Why not? - Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Then perhaps it was your husband.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 No.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 How do you know? I just do.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You're right.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But you were.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The poison.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I don't understand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A man with no motive is a man no one suspects.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Always keep your foes confused.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I don't believe you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You'd risk that just to confuse them? So many men, they risk so little.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They spend their lives avoiding danger.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And then they die.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'd risk everything to get what I want.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And what do you want? Everything.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 My friendship with the Lannisters was productive.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And who could trust a friend like that? Who could trust you? I don't want friends like me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 My new friends are predictable.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Very reasonable people.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I can't believe you're going.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Leaving me alone here with these people.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The time has come, my dear.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 There's nothing more tedious than a trial.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Except perhaps these gardens.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Have you been to see Tommen yet? No.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - How absentminded of me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Mm-hmm.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was good.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was very, very good.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You are even better.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But you need to act quickly.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And by the time you're married, it'll be too late.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Well, he could have done.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He could have done, but he didn't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - You don't know, Grandmother.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - But I do know.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you? What? I don't understand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Shh.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Don't you worry yourself about all that.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You just do what needs to be done.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Bring it through! And again.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Very nice.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Good.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Let's see what you can do.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Olly, you just watch for now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I can fight.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Have you ever held a sword before? I was the best archer in our hamlet.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was! I believe you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Right now, watch and learn.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You two.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Take it slow, try and disarm each other.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You know how to fight.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You could have gone easier on him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Lord Snow.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What do you think you're doing? Grenn and I were helping them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Grenn's a ranger.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You're a steward.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Someone has to train them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And that someone isn't you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Go find a chamber pot to empty.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Go on.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Do it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You traitor's bastard.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Give me an excuse.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Mormont's not here to protect you now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Get back to work.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Now! I said now! The bastard's well-liked.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You're not.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 For now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But you can't be acting commander forever.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 There will be a choosing.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The old maester will insist on it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You might reconsider his request to march on Craster's.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Let the mutineers take care of Snow.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 My father was highborn.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 My mother wasn't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Name's Locke.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Jon Snow.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You fight well.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What brought you up here? A sense of duty.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was a game warden in the Stormlands.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was stupid enough to get caught.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Chose the Wall over losing my hand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Come on, get on with it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What are you waiting for? Summer? Guess I was wrong.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You sent for me, Your Grace? Your Grace.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 How formal of you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door? Ser Boros is on duty tonight.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Tomorrow I believe-- -  So one? You have one man guarding the future king? I promise you Tommen's safe.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 We're protecting him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free? - What? - I've been wondering for months.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Why did she set you free? You know why.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 She hoped or did you promise? I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I wanted to get back to you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Should I have told her to fuck off? You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark? Catelyn Stark's dead.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it? I know you went to see Tyrion.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 That creature who murdered our son.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I had to see him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I had to know for myself.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And? He didn't do it, Cersei.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You've always pitied him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Our poor little brother.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Abused by the world.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Despised by his father and sister.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He'd kill us all if he could.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I want four men at Tommen's door day and night.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 That will be all, Lord Commander.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Ser Pounce? How did you get past the Kingsguard? Kingsguard.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I don't think you're supposed to be here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Word has it I'm to be your bride.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Don't you think? Yes.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But if my mother found out-- It can be our secret.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 So, Your Grace Yes? Tell me a secret.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Hello.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Aren't you a proper fellow? That's Ser Pounce.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Very handsome.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Joffrey didn't like him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 That's very cruel.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You don't strike me as cruel.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 No.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I don't think I am.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 That's a relief.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Because you know what happens when we marry? We say our vows in front of the high septon.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And after the ceremony, there's a feast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 When we marry, I become yours.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Forever.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's getting late.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I should go.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 May I come and visit you again? All right, then.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Remember, our little secret.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 "Ser Jaime Lannister.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Thereafter known as the Kingslayer.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	" It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And there's still room left on mine.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Valyrian steel.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Mmm.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's yours.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I can't accept this.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Lady Stark's dead.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I've got something else for you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I hope I got your measurements right.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'll find her.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 For Lady Catelyn.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And for you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I almost forgot.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I have one more gift.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I don't need a squire.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Of course you do.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He'll slow me down.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 My brother owes him a debt.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He's not safe here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You're keeping him from harm.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's chivalry.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I won't slow you down, ser-- my lady.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I promise I'll serve you well.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 See? He's a good lad.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You'll get along.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Compliments of Lord Tyrion.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 His axe from the Blackwater.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They say the best swords have names.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Any ideas? Oathkeeper.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Good-bye, Brienne.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Come on, move.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I should never have taken her away.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - She wasn't safe here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - She's not safe out there.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I should have known.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Castle Black could be next.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - I should go back for Gilly.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 We have orders.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 No one's to leave the castle.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And I remember who came after me and brought me home.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I tried.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Really, I did.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton? I don't know.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They'd pass wildling villages.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They could try to find shelter at one of them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The wildlings have joined up with Mance.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Every village or sheltered place will be deserted.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Except Craster's? You think Bran might have found-- Snow.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I don't mean to interrupt.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Thorne wants to see you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But I won't order anyone to go with you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Volunteers only.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Thank you, Ser Alliser.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Ahem, brothers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm going beyond the Wall to Craster's Keep.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They know the Wall.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They know our defenses.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If Mance learns what they know, we're lost.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But if that's not enough, then consider this.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Stabbed in the back by cowards.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 He deserved far better.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 All we can give him now is justice.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Who will join me? I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Then let me say my vows.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Thank you, brothers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 No, don't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Don't, please.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Please don't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Ow! You're hurting me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?  Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Rast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Go outside and feed the beast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 We should kill that thing.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You should shut your fucking hole, ugly little cunt.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You look like a fucking ballsack.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Ugly.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Look at your stupid cunt face.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I could piss in any gutter and soak five of you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 None of them cocksuckers got away from me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Haven't lost a fight since I was nine.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Maybe it's time.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What do you think, eh? Maybe you're the man.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Eh, cunt? I wouldn't stand a chance.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 None of us would.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A fucking legend! I would take any knight-- any knight, any time.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Fucking cunts in steel plate.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Fucking cowards.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What the fuck is that? Craster's last child.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A boy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Don't need another mouth to feed.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Hand him over.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - He didn't kill them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - He offered them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - To who? To the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 The white walkers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Shut up! So if it worked for him Let's give the walkers what they want.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Rast is headed that way.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Pink-eyed fuck.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You thirsty? Fuck! Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Do you hear that? Is that a baby? It's coming.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm going out there.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 No, we need to stay together.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm going.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Bran.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Bran.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Bran, what happened? Summer, he's hurt.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They've caught him in a trap.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Who? I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They have Ghost.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 They're Night's Watch.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Look.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Jon might be here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage? They might have been Night's Watch once, not anymore.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 We're not safe here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 We need to go.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 No.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Bran, we need to go now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm not leaving without Summer.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Can you remember where the cage was? The east side of the keep.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If I'm not back soon, we'll meet-- Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Help him up.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 This is nice.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Fine leather.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 You're no wildling.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Important.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Highborn.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Who are you? You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Isn't that a bit odd? I like your curly hair.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 My mom had curls like that.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Beautiful brown curls.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here? See you haven't played this game before.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 A highborn hostage, that's valuable.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - What the fuck's wrong with him? - Come here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 No, please.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Please.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 Please, let me help him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Who are you? - Please.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 - Who are you? - I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's Jon Snow's brother.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's Meera.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 It's Meera.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm right here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 And I thought this was gonna be another boring day.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	 I'm right here.
s04e05	First of His Name	May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times.
s04e05	First of His Name	 May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead.
s04e05	First of His Name	 In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Long may he reign! Long may he reign! Special day.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	 There he is.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Long may he reign.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Long may he reign.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He sits the throne like he was born to it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Yes.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He wasn't, though, was he? No, he wasn't.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You still mourn for Joffrey? He was my husband.
s04e05	First of His Name	 My king.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He would have been your nightmare.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your Grace, I feel-- You knew exactly what he was.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I did, too.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Doesn't matter what they do.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And what he did, it shocked me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Do you think I'm easily shocked? No.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The things he did shocked me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He's only a boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A good boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A decent boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He always has been.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He will need help if he's going to rule well.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He has you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A mother is not enough.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You're still interested in being queen, I take it? Oh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 After all that's happened-- it sounds strange, I know, but I am-- I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It would be a great honor, of course.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But I will have to speak to my father about it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Yes, speak to your father.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'll speak to mine.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I won't even know what to call you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
s04e05	First of His Name	 King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Murdered at his own wedding.
s04e05	First of His Name	  And we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Second Sons took the Meereenese navy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Who told you to take the navy? No one.
s04e05	First of His Name	 So why did you do it? I heard you liked ships.
s04e05	First of His Name	 How many ships? How many men can they carry? Would that be enough to take King's Landing? The Lannisters have more.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They're tired, dispersed.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And now their king is dead.
s04e05	First of His Name	 sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's hard to say.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It could be enough.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 can't conquer Westeros.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.
s04e05	First of His Name	 There's other news.
s04e05	First of His Name	 From Yunkai.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty.
s04e05	First of His Name	" Please leave me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Not you, Jorah.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A boy sits on the Iron Throne.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They've never been more vulnerable.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I didn't listen.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That all worked out well.
s04e05	First of His Name	 How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me? You're a Targaryen.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You're the Mother of Dragons.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I need to be more than that.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I will not sail for Westeros.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What, then? I will do what queens do.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I will rule.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Pull up your hood.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A memorable shade.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But how would they know? You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Is this the only way into the Eyrie? The mountains are impassable.
s04e05	First of His Name	 If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Not once in 1,000 years.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Who would pass the Bloody Gate? Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Stand to.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Stand to! - Stand to! Welcome back, Lord Baelish.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Uncle Petyr! My lord.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Oh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I have brought you a gift.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Lord Baelish.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - My lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.
s04e05	First of His Name	 My name is Al-- Oh, do take down that hood, child.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 My flesh and blood.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Of course.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I understand.
s04e05	First of His Name	 No one can know you're here.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It would put us in a very precarious position.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I would never say a thing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Lannisters want to destroy us.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They've been trying for years.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Now they know what it feels like.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They did, and my father's.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They killed my father, too, with poison.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Make him fly? Through the Moon Door.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They did.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They made us both.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I don't believe that for a moment.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Did he force himself on you? No.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - We never--  Good.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Take the back stairs.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Go.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We'll speak soon.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What took you so long? Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.
s04e05	First of His Name	 She's here.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Let's get married tonight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Ought we not inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony? There's only one Lord of the Vale.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The others can all hang.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I do think that we could wait until-- I'm done waiting, Petyr.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We had our wedding night many years ago.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Or don't you remember? Like it was yesterday.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine-- when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters-- The deed is done.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Faded into nothing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Only speaking of it can make it real.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Tonight it is, then.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm warning you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
s04e05	First of His Name	 When will the wedding take place in your mind? As soon as decency permits.
s04e05	First of His Name	 After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - A fortnight? - That seems reasonable.
s04e05	First of His Name	 No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And your wedding to Loras? Shortly after Tommen's.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Shortly? - A fortnight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I know you don't like them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I didn't like your husband.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Used to pat me on the back a lot.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I didn't trust him.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We had that in common.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Then whom can we trust? Ourselves alone.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Robert wasn't particularly rich.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Robert had me funding him.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year? Haven't a clue.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Go on, your best guess.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Pounds, tons, ounces? Doesn't matter.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The answer is the same.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That can't be.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Then how do we pay for anything? The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
s04e05	First of His Name	 How much? A tremendous amount.
s04e05	First of His Name	 There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.
s04e05	First of His Name	 There is no someone.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Someone does work there.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It is comprised of people.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And a temple is comprised of stones.
s04e05	First of His Name	 One stone crumbles and another takes its place.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That's what the Iron Bank is-- a temple.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You can't run from them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You can't cheat them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You can't sway them with excuses.
s04e05	First of His Name	 If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's for the good of the family, I understand that.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm not sure my brothers do.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And as a mother, that is your right.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I respect that.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We don't need to discuss it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You've started wars to protect this family.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire? Joffrey.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Cersei.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Walder Frey.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Meryn Trant.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Tywin Lannister.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Red Woman.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Beric Dondarrion.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Thoros of Myr.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Ilyn Payne.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Mountain.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Would you shut up? I can't sleep until I say the names.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The names of every fucking person in Westeros? Only the ones I'm going to kill.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Better than most.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
s04e05	First of His Name	 If he were here right now, what would you do? I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm almost done.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Only one name left.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Go on.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The Hound.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Thank you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know? - Really? - Oh, yes.
s04e05	First of His Name	 At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Anything sweet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.
s04e05	First of His Name	 My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
s04e05	First of His Name	 This is before she married your father and moved to the North.
s04e05	First of His Name	 By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Marriage changes people.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I didn't mean for you to stop.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Go on, enjoy them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 How do you like them? They're delicious.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Oh, gods, no.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He knew you liked lemon cakes.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He's so kind.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He really cares for you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Think where you'd be without him.
s04e05	First of His Name	 In their clutches and tried for murder.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Yes.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm very lucky.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He feels responsible for you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Oh, I know he does.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm so grateful.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Why? Why does he feel responsible for you? Well, I'm half Tully.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - He loved your family so much.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Loved your mother.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - No.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - That's what you wanted to say.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He's married to you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your mother never loved him.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Never.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The most obvious thing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your Uncle Brandon.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He almost killed Petyr in a duel.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And your mother loved him anyway.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Has he told you about them? - No.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies? -  No, never.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Are you pregnant? What? No, I told you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Lord Tyrion and I never-- I wasn't asking about Tyrion.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What have you let Petyr do with your body? - Aunt Lysa, no, I-- - Your young, pretty body.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Nothing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm a virgin.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Don't lie to me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You're hurting me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'll know if you lie.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm a virgin, I swear it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
s04e05	First of His Name	 All he says is that I'm stupid.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And I swear to you that he has never touched me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Not once, not ever.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Shh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Shh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Shh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's all right.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It will all be all right.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You'll be a widow soon.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You'll be the Lady of the Vale.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hmm.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse? Yes, my lady, when I was young.
s04e05	First of His Name	 There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He preferred litters.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Perhaps you should have stayed with him.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That's a long way off.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black.
s04e05	First of His Name	 If I were her, that's where I'd go.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Feel free to stop at any point.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Never, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm your squire.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I've made it this far in the world without a squire.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I don't see why I need one now.
s04e05	First of His Name	 All knights have squires, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm not a knight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And I'm not a slaver, either.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I don't own you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I swore an oath, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I am releasing you from that oath.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That means you could leave.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I know.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What do you think will happen if you leave? They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - The hell you doing? - Practicing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - What, ways to die? - No one's going to kill me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They will if you nance around like that.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That's no way to fight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's not fighting.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It's water dancing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Who taught you that shite? The greatest swordsman who ever lived.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Braavos.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They all are.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What do you know about anything? I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - It was not.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Was? He dead? - Yes.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - How? - He was killed.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Who by? Meryn Trant.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That's why Ser Meryn-- Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant? - He was outnumbered.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Syrio didn't have a sword.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Or armor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Just a stick.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You have a sword.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Let's see what he taught you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Dead like all the rest of your friends.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Prince Oberyn.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Writing letters? A poem, actually.
s04e05	First of His Name	 May I show you the gardens? I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
s04e05	First of His Name	 No, you couldn't.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I didn't realize you were a poet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Not a very good one.
s04e05	First of His Name	 For your paramour? For one of my daughters.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You have several, don't you? Eight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Eight? Eight daughters? The fifth is difficult.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I named her after my sister Elia.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Beautiful name.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Yes.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But I can't say it without turning sad.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And after I turn sad, I grow angry.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Perhaps that's why she's difficult.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they? Which joke is that? You're a prince of Dorne.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A legendary fighter.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But you could not save your sister.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'm a Lannister.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Queen for 19 years.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Daughter of the most powerful man alive.
s04e05	First of His Name	 But I could not save my son.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love? We can avenge them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Yes, we can avenge them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You really believe Tyrion murdered your son? I know he did.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We'll have a trial, anyway.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Laughing in the sun.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I want to believe that.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I want to believe she's happy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You have my word.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I don't know when I'll see her again.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Anything at all.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Myrcella loves the open water.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Please tell her her mother misses her very much.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Oh, no, no, no.
s04e05	First of His Name	 No, no, no, no.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hells.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Gods.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Did you remove the skin? No, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Have you ever cooked a rabbit before? No, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion? No, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That was the cooks.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What are you doing? I'm helping you with your armor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion? I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I kept his clothing and linens clean.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Carried his messages and returned the replies.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Mostly I poured wine.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Oh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat? I killed a man.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Who? A Kingsguard.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
s04e05	First of His Name	 How did you kill a Kingsguard? I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Bloody ridiculous.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Help me with these straps.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hey.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hey, get up.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Get up.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That's it lad, put it inside.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Get the fire going again.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We're all freezing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Aye.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What we need is a girl there.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I've got to have a piss.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Now keep quiet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You need water.
s04e05	First of His Name	 It doesn't matter.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Of course it matters.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You mustn't let anything stop you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They already have stopped me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 No.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You're not here.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You're far from here.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What does that mean? At the hill.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A great weirwood tree.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You've seen it, too.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He's waiting for you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We have to find it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You have to make it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We will.
s04e05	First of His Name	 This-- this isn't the end.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Not for you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Not yet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 How will we know the end? You'll know.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Brothers.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You do move quiet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - How many? - 11 men.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Most of them already drunk.
s04e05	First of His Name	 No guards posted.
s04e05	First of His Name	 They don't seem to have a care in the world.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I've seen what he can do with a knife.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Have you seen what I can do with a knife? Not yet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 There's a hut on the west side of the keep.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We should steer clear of it.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Why? They've got some hounds chained up inside.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.
s04e05	First of His Name	 New moon tonight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Get some rest.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We move at sundown.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I've always liked a girl with curls.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A touch of class.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You take whatever's left.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Get her up.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Stop.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Stop.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What are you doing? Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Stop.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Stop! - Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Stop! - Please.
s04e05	First of His Name	 -  Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Please, get off her! - Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Please! Please, leave her alone! Please, stop.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Stop.
s04e05	First of His Name	 -  What are you doing? Leave her alone! -  Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 -  No! - Shh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Shh, shh, shh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Shh.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you? If you let my sister go, I can help you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You can help me? I can.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And how you gonna do that? I have the sight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I can see things.
s04e05	First of His Name	 That's very helpful.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Things that haven't happened yet.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What a fine thing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 A fine thing.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister? No.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Don't close your eyes.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I saw you die tonight.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I saw your body burn.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
s04e05	First of His Name	 To arms! They're here, the Night's Watch.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Rescue party is here, lads.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Is Jon with you? - Aye.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I'll take you to him.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You're Brandon Stark? Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 The little crippled lord.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We're going for a ride, boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Jon! Jon! Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Starting with the idiot.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Do you hear? Do you hear? Hodor! Hodor! Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Hodor, get his knife.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Cut me loose.
s04e05	First of His Name	 -  Hodor, get his knife.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Cut me loose, Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Jojen and Meera, free them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Go! Jon.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Jon! If he sees you, he won't let you go north.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - He's my brother.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - And wants to protect you.
s04e05	First of His Name	 He'll take you back to Castle Black.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You have to decide.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Do you want to find the three-eyed raven? - Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We need to free Summer.
s04e05	First of His Name	 And we need to go.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Lord Snow.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Are you bringing me back for trial? We had a good thing here.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We were free men.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You'll never be free.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You'll never know what that's like.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You learn how to fight in a castle? Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry? How to fight with honor? You know what's wrong with honor? You.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Are you all right? Come with me.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Come on.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We lost four brothers? Five.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What the seven hells could do that to a man? I count 10 dead mutineers.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Locke said there were 11 of them.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Where's Rast? - Here's another.
s04e05	First of His Name	 - Jon.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Where in seven hells? Come here.
s04e05	First of His Name	 I missed you, boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	 What should we do with this lot? It's not safe for you here on your own.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Come with us to Castle Black.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We can find you work.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Keep you safe.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse.
s04e05	First of His Name	 Your brother crows beat us and worse.
s04e05	First of His Name	 We'll find our own way.
s04e05	First of His Name	 You want to stay here in Craster's Keep? Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	You're accused of killing the king.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I didn't do it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Which is why we're having a trial.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 One of my three judges is my father.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I want you to be the third.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I will also invite you to sit on the Small Council.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I never realized you had such respect for Dorne.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love? You can avenge them.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You really believe Tyrion murdered your son? You're still interested in being queen, I take it? It would be a great honor.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But I will have to speak to my father about it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I will speak to mine.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You started wars to protect this family's future.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tyrion deserves for lighting our future to fire.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What kind of knight beats a helpless girl? The kind who serves his king.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? - I am loyal servant! - Throw him in one of the black cells.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Oh no, no, no, no.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 There are many who know that without you, this city faced certain defeat.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The king won't give you any honors, but we will not forget.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The city is yours.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 All these people are your subjects now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I will answer injustice with justice.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 "Find a special gift.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 "Theon's favorite toy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 "He cried when I took it away from him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 and I'm going to bring him home.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We need to look East for ships and men.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - Soldiers win wars.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - We don't have any gold.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm running out of time, Ser Davos, which means you're running out of time.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that-- We've been here since midday.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest-- Welcome to the Iron Bank.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Please, sit.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What can we do for you, Lord Stannis? This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He shares no blood with me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He is a bastard born of incest.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 As was his brother before him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Yes, we have heard this story.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It's not a story.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It's the truth.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The king's grandfather tells a different story.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Gold you loaned him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold? More than any man living.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like "usurper" and "madman" and "blood right.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" Here, our books are filled with numbers.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We prefer the stories they tell.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 More plain.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Less open to interpretation.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How many fighting men remain loyal to you? And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships? None.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You would not be either here.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 That would be the pirates.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I consider it an honest accounting.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Which is a lot, I imagine.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Wars are expensive.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The war is over.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Who's the real power in King's Landing? - Ser Davos - Humor me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 -  Tywin Lannister.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - How old is Tywin Lannister? - 67.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - 67.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back? That is a problem for another time.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Stannis.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He's got the birthright.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He's in his prime.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He's a tried and tested battle commander.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	  The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The captain shouts to his first mate, "Bring me my red shirt.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A few days later, the lookout screams, "Two pirate ships!" The crew is shivering like scared mice.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But the courageous captain hollers, "Bring me my red shirt!" After the battle, the first mate asks, "Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?" The captain replies, "So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" The next morning the lookout screams, "10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!" The crew goes silent.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Calm as ever, the captain bellows "Bring me my brown pants!" You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke? Davos.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Only half rotted.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Join us, my friend.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Join us.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 This is Lhara.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - And this is-- - I am Lhara.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She's an artist, this one, truly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 No time, I'm afraid.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We sail at sunrise.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We? You, me-- we.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Once I thought this man loved me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Now I know he despises me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold-- You won't be alone.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And you won't be poor.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I gave it to your wife.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You're not my friend, my friend.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'll see you at sunrise.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 "I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He cried when I took it away from him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" Yes! They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Your prince.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Yes! Yes! As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Go left.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - Theon Greyjoy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - I don't know-- I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Take me to the dungeons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He's not in the dungeons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - Last cage on the right.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - Thank you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	  This way! We're going home.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 No! It's all right.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It's me, Yara.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You can't trick me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tell him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tell him you couldn't trick me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm not tricking you, Theon.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm saving you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Not Theon! Reek! - Reek! My name is Reek! -  They're here.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 If they catch us in here, we're trapped.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Help me with him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 No, you can't! - You can't! - You're Theon Greyjoy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek! This is turning into a lovely evening.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm Reek! Loyal Reek! Aah! Theon! Give me my broth You've got bigger balls than he ever did.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But with those big balls of yours how fast can you run? Make for the ship, now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But your brother.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My brother is dead.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I have a treat for you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A reward.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Reward? Yes, Reek.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And you didn't let them.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You remained loyal.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I-- I didn't want them to take me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I was so scared.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - I didn't want them-- - Yes, yes, Reek.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It's a bath.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 For you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Remove those rags.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The britches, too, Reek.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Take them off.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Do you love me, Reek? Yes, of course, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Good.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Because I need you to do something for me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Something very important.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 There's a castle, you see.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Some bad men hold this castle.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I need your help to take this castle back.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But how can-- I need you to play a role.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 To pretend to be someone you're not.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Pretend to be who? Theon Greyjoy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ He is a goatherd.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I thank him for his prayers.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It was your dragons, he says.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 They came this morning for his flock.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	  I cannot bring back his goats, but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Send the next one in.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 _ _ Queen Daenerys.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I thank you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Then it is my honor to receive you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 This pyramid included.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 For that, he has my gratitude.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I should be honored to meet him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You have, Your Grace.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You crucified him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Your father crucified innocent children.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My father spoke out against crucifying those children.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Is it justice to answer one crime with another? I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You'd be wise to remember that.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What's done is done.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And what traditions do you speak of? The tradition of funeral rite.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial? Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Let me take his body down.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Thank you, my queen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How many more? There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Send the next one in.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships? Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you-- Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I-- The trial begins this afternoon.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We only have the morning for affairs of state.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Shall we begin? Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A coward and a traitor.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Disgraceful.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound? seems a generous bounty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Make it 100.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What else? More whispers from the east, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The Targaryen girl? Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Conquered with what? She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Some 8,000 strong.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And she has three dragons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Baby dragons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Larger every year, Your Grace.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Mormont is spying on her for us.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 No longer.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He appears to be fully devoted to her.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He's an old man.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He wasn't fit to protect my son.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Joffrey didn't die on his watch.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Lord Varys is right.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 They are very impressive on the battlefield.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Less so in the bedroom.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Armies win them all the time.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She must be dealt with.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How, my lord? By force? Eventually, if it comes to that.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Can your little birds find their way into Meereen? Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Mmm.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Fetch my quill and paper.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Prince Oberyn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Lord Varys Only Varys.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm not actually a nobleman.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 No one is under obligation to call me lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And yet everyone does.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Did you spend much time in Essos? Five years.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 May I ask why? 'Tis a big and beautiful world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I don't want to be most of us.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Most of us aren't princes.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You are from Essos.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Where? Lys? I have an ear for accents.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I've lost my accent entirely.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I have an ear for that as well.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How did you get here? It's a long story.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 One you don't like telling people.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 People I trust.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You should come to the brothel and meet her.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We have some lovely boys on retainer, but You did like boys before? Really? Girls? Hmm.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Not at all.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But I was never interested in girls, either.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - What then? -  Nothing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Everybody is interested in something.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Not me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Such as? Let me guess, I've been pardoned.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Really? Father's orders.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Kingslayer! I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And if found guilty may the gods punish the accused.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Did you kill King Joffrey? No.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Did your wife, the Lady Sansa? Not that I know of.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How would you say he died, then? Choked on his pigeon pie.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 So you would blame the bakers? Or the pigeons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Just leave me out of it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The crown may call its first witness.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing? - Silence.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Silence! You will not speak unless called upon.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance blind eye-- I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You have a lot of poison in your store.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Had, Prince Oberyn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 My stores were plundered.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 By whom? By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Was it without question poison that killed him? Without question.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She wore this necklace the day of the wedding.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store? It was.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The Strangler.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 "I will hurt you for this.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" Your own brother said this to you? Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tyrion said, "And you will know the debt is paid.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" What debt? I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He wasn't pleased.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	  Do you remember the precise nature of this threat? I'm afraid I do, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council? Yes.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 After we received word of Robb Stark's death.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He didn't seem gladdened by the news.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You're excused, Lord Varys.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Father, may I ask the witness one question? One.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Have you forgotten, Lord Varys? Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 We will adjourn for now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Toll the bells in an hour's time.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Clear the court! You'd condemn your own son to death? I've condemned no one.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The trial is not over.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 This isn't a trial.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It's a farce.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I know nothing of the sort.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - You've always hated Tyrion.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - He killed his king.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 As did I.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I saved your life so you could murder my brother? - It won't be murder.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 It'll be justice.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - Justice? I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - He'll be executed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - No, he'll be punished accordingly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Once you said family is what lives on.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 All that lives on.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm well aware of your oath.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember? What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer? It survives through me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'll leave the Kingsguard.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Done.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He'll plead for mercy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You'll remove your white cloak immediately.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And you'll never turn your back on your family again.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You have my word.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And you have mine.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Not going well, is it? - You're going to be found guilty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 - Oh, you think so? When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Father's agreed to it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Father is not Joffrey.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He'll keep his word.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How do you know? Do you trust me? Keep your mouth shut.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 No more outbursts.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 This will all be over soon.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 The crown may call its next witness.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 State your name.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Shae.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest? I swear it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Do you know this man? Yes.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tyrion Lannister.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How do you know him? I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 What do you know of this? I know that he's guilty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He and Sansa planned it together.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Silence! Continue.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 She blamed their deaths on the king.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tyrion was happy to help.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He hated Joffrey.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He hated the queen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He hated you, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid? I wasn't just her maid.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I was his whore.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	  I beg your pardon? You said you were his His whore.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 How did you come to be in his service? He stole me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 "You belong to me now," he said.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 "I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" Silence.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Silence! And did you? Did I what? Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I did everything he wanted.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Whatever he told me to do to him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Whatever he felt like doing to me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I kissed him where he wanted.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I licked him where he wanted.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I let him put himself where he wanted.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I was his property.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 He ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I took his face in my hands and said, "I am yours and you are mine.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	" Shae.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Please don't.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I am a whore.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Remember? That was before he married Sansa.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 After that, all he wanted was her.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 But she wouldn't let him into her bed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I wish to confess.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I wish to confess.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You wish to confess? I saved you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I saved this city and all your worthless lives.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I should have let Stannis kill you all.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Tyrion.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Do you wish to confess? Yes, Father.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm guilty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Guilty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Is that what you want to hear? You admit you poisoned the king? No, of that I'm innocent.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I am guilty of being a dwarf.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Oh, yes, I am.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I've been on trial for that my entire life.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Have you nothing to say in your defense? Nothing but this-- I did not do it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I wish I was the monster you think I am.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Ser Meryn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Ser Meryn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 And I know I'll get no justice here.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 So I will let the gods decide my fate.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	 I demand a trial by combat.
s04e07	Mockingbird	I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
s04e07	Mockingbird	  I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit? You threw your life away.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You threw it away.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It's not a joke.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You understand that, don't you? Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I couldn't-- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I couldn't do it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You fell in love with a whore.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Yes, I fell in love with a whore.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You do see that? He gets you back as his heir.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The future Lord of the Rock.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 All so perfect.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It felt good to take that from him.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He's willing to sacrifice any of us.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Not you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You're the golden son.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Careful.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'm the last friend you've got.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 At least I got to tell them what they really are.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Yes, brilliant speech.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They'll be talking about it for days to come.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I thought you were a realist.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Didn't realize you'd die for pride.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Don't give up on me just yet.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I can't save you this time either.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It is tempting.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Well Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If he wins.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Not Ser Meryn.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Go on, move it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Come on.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Mercy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Please.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Please, mercy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Ser Gregor.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Welcome to the capital.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Thank you for riding here so quickly.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You seem to be in good form.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Who am I fighting? Does it matter? Could be food.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Could be soldiers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Then I remembered they burned my hut down.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Who were "they"? I stopped asking a while ago.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's not gonna get better.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Doesn't seem so.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A bad way to go.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Haven't you had enough? Of what? I know.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Time to go.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Take matters into my own hands.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The thought has occurred to me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 So why go on? Habit.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Nothing could be worse than this.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Maybe nothing is worse than this.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Nothing isn't better or worse than anything.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Nothing is just nothing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Who are you? My name is Arya.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Arya Stark.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You her father? Her captor.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A fair exchange, that is.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You give me, I give you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Fair.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A balance.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No balance anymore.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Wish it were wine.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 So do I.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's where the heart is.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's how you kill a man.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The fuck you doing? There's a price on your head.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The king's dead.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you? You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 This day's really not working out the way you planned.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He on your little list? He can't be.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I don't know his name.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 What's your name? - Rorge.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Thank you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You're learning.
s04e07	Mockingbird	  Rangers returning! They return! -  Rangers returning! - Greetings.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Didn't think I'd see you again.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 All right, Jon? Welcome back, brother.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Lord Snow.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 This is no place for wild beasts.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Come on, Ghost.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he? We need to prepare.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We've been preparing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We should seal the tunnel.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Plug it with rocks and ice.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Flood it and let it freeze.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And how would we range north? - We wouldn't.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 -  Coward.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass? We can't defend the gate against 100,000 men.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 This castle has stood for thousands of years.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The bars on those gates are four inches thick.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Cold-rolled steel.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They won't stop them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The stewards.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel? No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Who would that be? - The builders.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Ah, the builders.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Do you agree with him? No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Moving on.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Aye.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My lord.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You have new clothes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Softer than a virgin's thighs.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I sent for you days ago.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - I've been a bit busy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Doing what? My lonesome bachelor days are over.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She's dim-witted.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister? Falyse.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Aye, I did know about the older sister.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And you understand the rules of inheritance? Falyse is 40 and barren.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She does.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Unless she happens to perish before her father.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Then Lollys gets the castle.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You and my sister deserve each other.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why did you bother to come here? You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Is it two wives you want or two castles? One of each will do.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I have gold.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 What can I buy with gratitude? You might be surprised.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A Lannister always pays his debts.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Your sister's a Lannister, too.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My wife is heir to Winterfell.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I could carve you out a big piece of it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If and may and could.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It's bloody cold up north.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Lollys is soft and warm.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And close.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Does he frighten you so much? I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He's freakish big and freakish strong.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But one misstep and I'm dead.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why should I risk it? Because you're my friend.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Aye, I'm your friend.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And when have you ever risked your life for me? I like you, pampered little shit that you are.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I just like myself more.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I understand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'm sorry it has to be this way.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We had some good days together.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Yes, we did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 What will you do? I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Won't that make for a great song? I hope to hear them sing it one day.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded, but your window is not.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Don't do that again.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 These are my private quarters.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If I want you here, I will summon you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Forgive me, my queen.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I live to serve you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Tell me why you're here.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I came to ask a favor.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I only have two talents in this world-- war and women.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You are staying here in Meereen to rule.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That is a wise decision.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I respect it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 There is only one, and she does not want me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You swore me your sword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My sword is yours till the day I die.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets? I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Send me to kill your enemies.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Any enemy anywhere.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Let me do what I do best.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Very well.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Do what you do best.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Take off your clothes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Oh.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Come in, my queen.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Please.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You could never disturb me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No, no, no.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Not that one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You don't even want to touch that one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Next to it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's the one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He said, "Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Make it count.
s04e07	Mockingbird	" A joke.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Not a very good one, I'm afraid.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It was.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I-- humor isn't my strength.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided? Not always.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Most of these powders and potions are lies.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Did you use it with Stannis? No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Don't be upset.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Men never crave what they already have.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It's only flesh.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It needs what it needs.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I thank God every day for bringing you to us.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And Stannis to you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He wants to bring Shireen with us.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I think that would be ill-advised.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I understand how you feel.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Hmm.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But that is impossible.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why? You don't need powders and potions, my queen.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You don't need lies.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 However harsh it is.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 However hard for us to understand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 When we set sail, your daughter must be with us.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The Lord needs her.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Jorah the Andal.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Khaleesi.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - You're here early.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Later than some.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You don't approve? It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You neither approve nor trust.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother? I did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I trust you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 How could you ever have faith in a man like that? I could never have faith in a man like Daario.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - You have? - I have.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They mutilate little boys by the thousands.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning? It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Let the priests argue over good and evil.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Slavery is real.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I can end it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I will end it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And I will end those behind it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Hizdahr zo Loraq? He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He will explain the choice they have before them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Tell him I changed my mind.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Yes, Khaleesi.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Tell him you changed my mind.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Rat cunts.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Fucking whore.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You're doing it wrong.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You need to burn away that horrible bit there.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-- No fire.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It'll only take a second.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - It won't hurt that much.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - No fire! Shut up about it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Shut up about everything.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No reward is worth this much trouble.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You say your brother gave you that sword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My brother gave me this.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It was just like you said a while back.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why? Thought I stole one of his toys.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I didn't steal it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I was just playing with it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The pain was bad.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The smell was worse.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My father, who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You think you're on your own? Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Couldn't agree more, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Not working for your former lord any longer.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Yes, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Don't get drunk.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Can I get you anything else? No, this will do nicely, thank you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Kidney pie is wonderful.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Thanks.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I do my best.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Easy enough.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Got no right to cook anything, them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Oh, and the gravy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Don't get me started on the gravy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Very difficult to get right.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You cannot give up on the gravy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No gravy, no pie.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Simple as that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's nice armor.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Are you a knight? No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Generally speaking.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Flea Bottom born and bred.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 What brings you to these parts? We're looking for someone.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A lot of people come in here.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Just the other day we had 17-- A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Starks? What, like them lot from "Winterhell"? No, ain't seen anyone like that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I heard they was all traitors.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Don't need no traitors in here.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie? What? It's nothing, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Don't want to offend, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Truly, I don't.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The Lannisters have money.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 People kill for money.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My lord.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Could I have a word? What about? Not kidney pie.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You seem like a proper lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Someone who could be trusted.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I never met no Sansa Stark.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But I know her sister Arya.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She's presumed dead.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She weren't when I last spoke to her.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - When was that? - Heading up north with the Night's Watch.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She was all dressed up as a boy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Like your ladyship, only without the armor.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Going by the name Arry.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - So what happened to her? - Well-- The quick version.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The Lannisters took us prisoner.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We escaped.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The Brotherhood took us prisoner.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They sold me to the innkeep.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Big ugly fellow.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 -  Not friendly.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - The Hound.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's the one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Um, you were saying? Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why the Eyrie? Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Catelyn Stark's sister.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She's Arya's last living relative with money.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She hates the Lannisters.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Sansa could be there, too.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Aye, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Could be.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You sure about this? No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Mm, do tell.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Your sister.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Oh.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Cersei approached me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We spoke a great deal about her daughter.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 How worried your sister is about her.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I think she may have even believed it herself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She desperately wants to see you killed.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She didn't need to bother you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It looks as though I've taken care of that myself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She's wanted this for a long time.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Yes, I know.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We met, you and I.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Many years ago.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I think I would have remembered that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Unlikely.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You had just been born.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My first time away from Dorne.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I didn't like anything about the Rock.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Not the food, not the weather, not your accents.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Nothing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But the biggest disappointment you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That would have made things so much easier.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Every day we would ask.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Every day she would say, "Soon.
s04e07	Mockingbird	" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Your head was a bit large.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No red eye.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No tail between your legs.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Just a tiny pink cock.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 We didn't try to hide our disappointment.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 "That's not a monster," I told Cersei.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 "That's just a baby.
s04e07	Mockingbird	" And she said, "He killed my mother.
s04e07	Mockingbird	" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Until your brother made her stop.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 "It doesn't matter," she told us.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 "Everyone says he will die soon.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I hope they are right.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 He should not have lived this long.
s04e07	Mockingbird	" Well sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I disagree.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I've come to the perfect place.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 And all those who have wronged me are right here.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I will be your champion.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Hello, Robin.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 What are you doing? I'm building my home, Winterfell.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 At least I think I am.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I haven't been back there in a very long time.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why did you leave? It's a long story.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I stay here in the Eyrie.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Yes, you certainly are.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 When will you go back? Probably never.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Oh.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Does Winterfell have a Moon Door? No, I'm afraid not.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It's not high up in the mountains.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It's down on the ground.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That sounds dangerous.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - How do you make people fly? - We don't.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like? I never did anything with them at all.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Or you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I like the sound of that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 All right.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It can go in here in this big tower.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Careful.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You've ruined it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - I didn't ruin it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - You did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I was fixing it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Knocking things down isn't fixing them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - It's ruining them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - I didn't ruin it! - You're being stupid.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - I didn't ruin it! Robin, I'm sorry, I-- Children.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 -  I hit him.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Yes, I saw.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I shouldn't have done that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 No, his mother should have a long time ago.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Consider it a step in the right direction.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If he tells Aunt Lysa Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I was trying to remember what everything looked like.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'll never see it again.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 A lot can happen between now and never.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I loved your mother more than you could ever know.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 But we don't live in that world.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You're more beautiful than she ever was.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Lord Baelish Call me Petyr.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa? Come here, Sansa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Do you know how far the fall is? No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Neither do I, precisely.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Hundreds of feet.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 The impact breaks them right apart.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Like eggs dropped on the floor.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Sometimes pieces remain intact.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You'll find the head sitting on its own.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Every hair in place.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Blue eyes staring at nothing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I know what you did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I never should have hit Robin, I know it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I promise it won't happen-- Don't be coy with me, you little whore.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You kissed him.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You kissed Petyr.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - I didn't.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You don't understand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - I saw you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - He kissed me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I pulled away.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 - Liar! Whore! He is mine! My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down! Lysa! Let her go.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 You want her? This empty-headed child? Let her go.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She's just like her mother.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 She'll never love you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I lied for you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I killed for you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Why did you bring her here? Why? I'll send her away.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I swear on my life.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I swear to all the gods.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Let her go, Lysa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Oh, my sweet wife.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 My sweet, silly wife.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 I have only loved one woman only one, my entire life.
s04e07	Mockingbird	 Your sister.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	Here we are.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Ready? "The Rains of Castamere.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	" You fucking deaf? Same wrong guess every fucking time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Listen, you cunt.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Oh! "The Bear and the Maiden Fair.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	" There's a man with an ear.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 First time I saw you with your breeches down, I thought you were a eunuch.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You've seen it, girls.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Like a baby snail peeking out of his shell.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Your baby was crying this morning.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Woke me up.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You hear me? Yes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Well, got anything to say? I'm sorry he woke you up.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I don't care if you're sorry.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Keep that baby quiet or I will.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Don't you ever touch him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Little wildling bitch.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You should have stayed with your own kind.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You listening to me? - Shut your mouth.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - What? It's just an owl, you dumb bitch.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 No, it's not.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - - Shh.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I should never have left her there.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - You couldn't have known.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Of course I could've known.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 They've been raiding the villages close by.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 So it's all right, then? Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?  I didn't say it was all right.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We're pledged to guard the realms of men.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She's dead because of me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We can't even guard Mole's Town.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We can't go after them.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You know that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It's what they want.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And little Sam.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 As if I cut their thats self.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Maybe she managed to hide herself.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I thought all of you was dead.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You went north with Mormont and no one came back.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Not for ages.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But then you did.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She survived the long march to the Wall.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She survived a white walker, for fuck's sake.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She might have got out.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She might have.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Mance and his army must be close.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 100,000 of them.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And there's what, You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully? How do 102 men stop 100,000? Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	  You think he was spying on you? No, not spying.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	  The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 They make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Yes, Your Grace.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But you are not Dothraki.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Well, I don't see why it matters.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Grey Worm isn't interested.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 None of the Unsullied care what's under our clothes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He was interested.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What? I believe he was interested.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it? All of it? The-- the pillar and the stones.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I don't know, Your Grace.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Haven't you ever wondered? Yes, Your Grace.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Missandei.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 _ _ _ _ The lessons you give I in common tongue these are precious to I.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - To me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - To me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Jorah the Andal, he teaches I-- he teaches me this word.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Do you remember the name you were given at birth? I remember nothing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Only Unsullied.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 When they cut you, do you remember that? I'm sorry.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'm sorry they did that to you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why? Why sorry? It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 If the masters never cut me, I never am Unsullied.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn to kill the masters.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I never meet Missandei from the island of Naath.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I am sorry I-- for today.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I am sorry.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 _ _ _ Kraken.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Mmm.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Strong as long as they're in the sea.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 When you take them out of the water, no bones.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 They collapse under their proud weight and slump into a heap of nothing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You'd think they know that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Unfortunately, they're not very bright.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What do you tell them? I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - And what are you really? - I'm Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Formidable, proud.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'm Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Until when? Always.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Forever.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - That's right.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Until you're rotting in the ground.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Remember what you are and what you're not.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Bring me Moat Cailin.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 No closer.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Who are you? I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And you say you're Theon Greyjoy? Yes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And why should I believe that? I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 His third and last living son.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I am your prince.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I swear it by the Drowned God.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What is dead may never die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What is dead may never die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army? Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And what does Lord Bolton want? You are fading from sickness, you are badly outnumbered, and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Do this, and he will be just and fair with you as he has been with me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The Boltons will give you safe passage to the Stony Shore.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He wants us to surrender? My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I watched him bend the knee.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 There was no shame there.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He fought with honor, as did you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 "No shame.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	" "Fought with honor.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	" I'm sorry, I didn't hear.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 "No shame.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	" "Fought with honor.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	" Only a whipped dog would speak this way.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Or a woman.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Are you a woman, boy? You don't know-- The ironborn will not surrender.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 My name is Reek You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy, or whoever the fuck you are.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 My name is Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What in the hell are you muttering? I'm Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here? Yes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You're going home.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	  You didn't really think I'd let them go, did you? It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Sad, but true.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Traditions are important.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Where are we without our history? - Eh? - Yes, my lord.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Will we go home now? I believe we will.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 To our new home.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish? A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	  Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We've fought off invaders ever since.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She told me nothing about you, Baelish.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But I didn't need to hear from her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Moneylender.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Whoremonger.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, - it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - My lord-- And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Always been a grubby job.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn-- Lady Arryn invited me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She and I have been close since childhood.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Yes, we all know how close you were.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Her death is our affair.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Of course.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Her suicide shattered us all.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She was an odd fish.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Everyone knew that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But suicide? She adored that boy of hers.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I don't see her abandoning him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Not by choice.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She was always prone to melancholy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We were told there was a witness.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 A girl.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 A niece of yours, I believe.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 A girl with no learning and scattered wits.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I assure you, she would be of no help.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We'd like to speak with her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Let me fetch her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 -  No need.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Come closer, child.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You have nothing to fear from us or him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - My lady-- - I wasn't asking you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - He can stay.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Tell us what you saw.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I have to tell the truth.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'll tell you everything.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 My name is not Alayne.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm? Lord Baelish has told many lies.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 All to protect me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I had no friends in King's Landing except one.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He saved me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Smuggled me away when he had the chance.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The Lannisters have friends everywhere.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Even the Vale.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Your secret is safe with us, my lady.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Your father grew up right here in these halls.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We hunted together many times.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He was a fine man.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You knew her well, my lords, my lady.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You knew she was a troubled woman.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She always loved Lord Baelish.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She told me herself.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 For a time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 My aunt was a jealous lady.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That he would abandon her for a younger woman.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And then one day she saw him kiss me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lady Sansa.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He's always been so kind to me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I was so happy to be here, to be free.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 All because of him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But my aunt turned on me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She cursed me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Called me a whore.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Promised to throw me through the Moon Door.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She said she didn't want to live anymore.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He tried to reason with her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was-- Shh.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It's not your fault.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You could see it in the way she raised that boy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Apologies, my lady.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And to you as well, Baelish.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 We treated you a bit harshly.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You want justice, Lord Royce.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I can hardly complain about that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I want the same.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there? For Lysa, no.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 They fought together to overcome the Mad King.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 A timid boy at a tavern brawl.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Are you questioning our courage? I want to know which side you're on.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark? Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Who stands against him now? Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 More often they die young.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I adored Lysa with all my heart.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He needs to learn how to swing a sword.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 How to ride a horse.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Aye, it's time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Yes, it's time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Time for Robin to leave the nest.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Ser Barristan.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Yes? Who sent you? - Ser Barristan.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Ser Jorah.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Have I forgotten a council meeting? No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What's this? A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You spied on her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Who gave you this? Does it matter? Have you told her? I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Let me speak with her in private.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You'll never be alone with her again.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why did the usurper pardon you? If we could speak alone.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 No, speak to me here.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Explain it to me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He wants to divide us.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The pardon was signed the year we met.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It is not forged.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why, then? I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What was the content of these letters? - Information.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - What information? When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 When you were married.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 When your brother died.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You told him I was carrying Drogo's child? - I-- - Yes or no? - Khaleesi.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Don't call me that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child? Yes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I stopped you from drinking his wine.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Because you knew it was poisoned.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I suspected.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You betrayed me from the first.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Forgive me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I never meant-- please, Khaleesi, forgive me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father - and stole my brother's throne - I have protected you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Fought for you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Killed for you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 and you want me to forgive you? I have loved you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Go back to your masters in King's Landing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Collect your pardon if you can.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Daenerys, please.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Go.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Now.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Moat Cailin is yours, Father.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Walk with me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Has there been any word from Locke? No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Unimportant.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 A cripple, a young boy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 None of the northern lords have seen them.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Dead most likely.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Most of the ironborn have fled the North.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Now more will follow, thanks to you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Tell me what you see.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Moors, fields, hills.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Tell me what you see.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Nothing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Not nothing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The North.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And I am the Warden of the North.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The North is mine.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Now tell me, what is your name? Ramsay Snow.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 No, not Ramsay Snow.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Open it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You honor me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Yes? First time I saw you, you were just a child.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Not a child any longer.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why did you help me? They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That's not an answer.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me? I don't know.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Neither do I.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me? I know what you want.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Do you? I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Not really.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Nothing makes you happy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Lots of things make me happy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Like what? Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Is that it? At least I could have been there to watch.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You protected him for most of his life.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You think you could have saved him? I wasn't the damn wine taster.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Little shit deserved to die, but poison-- poison's a woman's weapon.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Men kill with steel.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That's your stupid pride talking.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It's why you'll never be a great killer.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'd pay good money to see that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You should have let me burn it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It's a fleabite.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Well, we won't have to walk too much further.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You really think my aunt will pay for me? Aye, she'll pay.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I've never even met her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Doesn't matter.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You're her blood.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Family, honor, all that horseshit.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'm not a lady.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Who would pass the Bloody Gate? The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And his traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Then I offer my condolences.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Lady Arryn died.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Three days ago.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - I'm afraid to leave.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - You shouldn't be.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 She said it's not safe outside.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It wasn't safe for her inside.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 People die at their dinner tables.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 They die in their beds.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 They die squatting over their chamber pots.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Everybody dies sooner or later.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Don't worry about your death.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Worry about your life.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Shall we go? Wine always helps.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I thank you for it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Trial by combat.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Tells you something about the gods.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 How much longer? Soon.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right? I've never seen him fight.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Oh, he's going to die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'm going to die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Oberyn believes in himself.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That's putting it mildly.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? - Breaking at the wheel? - Beheading.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Seems rather ordinary.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Filicide is sons.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Nepoticide.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 That's the one.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Cousins.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Cousins, you're right.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 There is no word for cousin killing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Well done.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister? Of course.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Wet-nurse dropped him on his head.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Left him simple.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 - Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Crushing beetles with a rock.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Nothing made him happier.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Nothing made you happier.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 On the contrary.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 The joke wore thin, though.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 For you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You drifted away.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I had other interests.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Yes, other interests.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But I stayed with Orson.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why? I was curious.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 "Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?" He gave me an answer.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 "Smash the beetles.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Smash 'em.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	" I wasn't deterred.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I was the smartest person I knew.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 So I went to Maester Volarik's library.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Volarik.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Tried to touch me once.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Doesn't seem right.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 So I went back to the source.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 There was something happening there.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But he wasn't mindless.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He had his reasons.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And I became possessed with knowing what they were.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Did I hear dragon wings? No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I heard And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles? I know, I know.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 But still, it filled me with dread.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Piles and piles of them, years and years of them.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I tried to stop Orson once.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He was twice your size.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He just pushed me aside with a "kuuh" and kept on smashing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about? I don't know.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Good luck today.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Looks like very light armor.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I like to move around.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You could at least wear a helmet.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You shouldn't drink before a fight.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It could get you killed.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 It could get me killed.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Today is not the day I die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You're going to fight that? I'm going to kill that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Thank the gods.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this man Tyrion Lannister.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 May the Mother grant them mercy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 May the Father give them such justice as they deserve.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 And may the Warrior guide the hand - - of our champion-- Don't leave me alone in this world.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Never.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Have they told you who I am? Some dead man.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I am the brother of Elia Martell.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I'm going to hear you confess before you die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You raped my sister.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You murdered her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You killed her children.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Say it now and we can make this quick.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Say it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You raped her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You murdered her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You killed her children.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children! Wait.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Are you dying? No, no, no.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You can't die yet.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You haven't confessed.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Say it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Say her name.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Elia Martell.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You raped her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 You killed her children.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Elia Martell.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Say it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Say her name.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Say it! Elia Martell.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 I killed her children.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Then I raped her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Then I smashed her head in like this! The gods have made their will known.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	 Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	What was she like? She she had red hair.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Oh? - How big were her feet? - What do you want me to say? I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 To be with someone.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 To love someone and have them love you back.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're the closest I'll ever get to knowing.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 So you and Gilly never? No.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 She just had a baby.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And she never offered.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 But if she had, you would have? You'd have broken your vows? The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What? "I shall take no wife," yes, that's in there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 There's no denying that.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 "I shall father no children.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	" It's very specific.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 But what do our vows have to say about other activities is open to interpretation.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We didn't.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 So what's it like? It's there's this person, this whole other person.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And you-- for a little-- for a little while, you're more than just you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're-- I don't know.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I'm not a bleeding poet.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 No, you're really not.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 There'll be arrows for all of us soon, I imagine.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 There will.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Go get some sleep, Sam.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I'll take this watch.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Did I ever tell you about her? - My Sheila? - Yes.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 That was a night to remember.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Her fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And she was nice and soft down below.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 No, she was no ordinary beast.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Many is the man who-- I know you never fucked a bear.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You know you never fucked a bear.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Right now I don't want to think about the bear you never fucked.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a crow's heart.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We could be waiting here a while.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Good.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Then they started hunting us down.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 This time, we're the ones doing the hunting.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You've got a lot to say about killing.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Even more words than arrows.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Back in those villages, I killed just as many of them as you did.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 More, I reckon.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Yes, but none of those were your crow lover.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I probably killed him already.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 So you've said.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And if not, the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around my neck.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 More words.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You been thinking about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like? Maybe I have.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Jon Snow is mine.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly? Maester Aemon.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - How did you know-- - That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night? - Let me help you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Oh, no need.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Thousands of books and no eyes to read them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 But you didn't answer my question.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What are you reading? Maester Faull.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Ah, the wildlings.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a wildling was this very library.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 But what he says about what they do, it's all true.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Love is the death of duty.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He didn't listen and neither did you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall to come here and read about the terrible things that may have happened to the girl you love.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I don't love her.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Yes, you do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - No.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Yes, you do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I remember how it sounds.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I was in love once.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You were? You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you? I'm sorry, Maester.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I didn't mean it like that.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Do you know who I was before I came here? What I could have been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 A future king always does.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 One of them succeeded.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I was very young.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Who was she? Ah.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I could tell you everything about her.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Who she was, how we met, the color of her eyes, and the shape of her nose.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I can see her right in front of me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 She's more real than you are.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Go to bed, Tarly.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Sorry, I can't open the gate for anybody.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Orders.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You don't understand.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They killed everyone.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Everyone but me and my baby.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They're out there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I saw them on my way here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They may have seen me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They may have followed me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Please.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I'm sorry, I can't.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 If they find us out here, you don't know Pyp! Open the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - I can't.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Sam, is that you? Yes.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate! I never heard you curse before.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Yes, well, best get used to it.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Are you all right? Shh, you're all right.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Of course you are, my brave little fella.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - It was horrible.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - I'm so, so sorry.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I didn't know until I got back.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Don't let them send me away, Sam.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Never.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - I know there's no women allowed.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 From now on, wherever you go, I go, too.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Get ready! - Man the gate! - Ready yourselves! Make haste! - Prepare! - Up on the Wall! Quickly! Up! Up! How many? How many are there? Beyond the trees! It's time.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Light them up! Light them all! Move! Pick up the pace! Come on, come on.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Here we go, boys, there's one.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Let's go.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 There's two.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Let's get the next load.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Yes, Ser.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You can say it if you like.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We should have sealed the tunnel while we had the chance, like you suggested.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end-- for him, for the clever little twats, for everyone.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 This is not the end.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Not for us.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your wildling whore had finished the job.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You'll be safe down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I'll check on you as soon as I can.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're leaving me again? I'm not leaving you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're going up there and we're staying down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 That's leaving.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You said from now on we'd stay together.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I didn't mean in the same room.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What are you going to do out there? - Help my brothers.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - How? You're going to fight the free folk when they come? They'll kill you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 In Mole's Town, they killed everyone.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Why not? You won't matter up there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You will down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I made a promise to defend the Wall and I have to keep it because that's what men do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Promise me you won't die.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I promise you I won't die.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 There's a lot more wildlings on the other side of the Wall than this side.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We've got loads of weapons and things.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It's the perfect place for us to be.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I've never thrown a spear before.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I've never held a sword with a proper edge.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 This is no place for me to be.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're not afraid? Of course I'm afraid.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 There's a band of wildlings coming to kill us.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 If you're afraid of a band of wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a white walker? I didn't know I was going to kill it.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 But I had to do something.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I didn't have any choice.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It was going to kill Gilly and take the baby.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I wasn't a steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I was nothing at all.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 But you're afraid now? Yes, well I'm not nothing anymore.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Most of their men are up top.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Didn't count more than 20 down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Leftovers.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They got a big fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 How high are the walls? Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Let's kill some crows! Come on! Come on, brothers! Archers nock.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Everyone else hold.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Grenn, no! I said nock and hold, you cunts! - Does nock mean draw? - No, Ser! - Does fucking hold mean fucking drop? - No, Ser! - You all plan to die here tonight? - No, Ser! That's very good to hear.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Draw! No, down below! Draw! Light them up.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Come on, get up! They're attacking the southern gate! - Now? - Now.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I'm going down there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What? What are you fucking waiting for? Loose! You heard the man.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Loose! You, over there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Did you get one? - No.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Ah, shit, Pyp! Shit.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Sam.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Yeah? I think we're gonna die.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 If you keep missing, we will.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Come on! Come on! Brothers! have defended this castle.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 She's never fallen before.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 She will not fall tonight.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Those are Thenns at our walls.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They eat the flesh of the men they kill.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight? No! Tonight we fight.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And when the sun rises, I promise you, Castle Black will stand! The Night's Watch will stand.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 With me now! Now with me! No discipline.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 No training.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Gang of thieves, that's all this is.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Those men obeyed orders.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We can't just let them attack the gate! The bars of those gates are four inches of cold-rolled steel.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Those are giants riding mammoths down there! Do you think your cold-rolled steel is gonna stop them? No such thing as giants.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 A story for the children.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Brother Slynt.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're the most experienced man he's got, Ser, and he needs you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Needed below? Yes.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Yes.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Archers, nock your arrows! Nock arrows! Draw! Loose! They won't summit before dawn.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 How do you know that? Because I've made that climb.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Hold the bridge! Hold, wait for it! Come on with the rocks! Nock! Draw! Loose! Down! No! No! To the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Come on, let's move.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It's gonna open.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I got one right through the heart.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He's dead.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Oh, is it over? - No.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Well, then You're all right.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're all right.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I'll get help.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Shh.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Shh.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Maester Aemon is coming.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He's gonna make it all right.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Shh.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Shh.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Now.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Now! The outer gate won't hold.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Take five men, hold the inner gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Aye.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Hold the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 If they make it through They won't.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Come on, Hill.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And you, Cooper.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You three, on me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Come on, you lazy bastards.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Oil.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Oil on the ramp! Protect the gate! Get him inside.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Hold the fucking gate! Hold it! We need more men down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - We have to hold the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - But we need men here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Tell Jon.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He's in command.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Let's go.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Get me to the top! You hear me?! Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me, Olly.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Get me to the top.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And when we give the signal, bring us back down.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You hear me? Find a weapon, Olly.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Fight them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Clear the way! Let's go! - Out of the way! - Get out of here! Cut the rope! Wait! No! - We need more archers.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Here I am.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Come on.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Quickly.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What are you doing up here? The wildlings are over the walls.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Ser Alliser's fallen.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 The castle won't stand much longer.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Edd, you have the Wall.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Come, brothers.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Now fight with me! Might as well enjoy our last night, right, boys? Light the fuckers up! Nock! Draw! Loose! How are we gonna stop that? Shot 20 arrows in him already.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You heard Jon.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We hold the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We hold the gate! Mother, save me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Father, save me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 The gods aren't down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It's the six of us.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You hear me? Night gathers and now my watch begins.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It shall not end until my death.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I shall wear no crown and win no glory.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I shall live and die at my post.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I am the sword in the darkness.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I am the watcher on the walls.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch for this night and all the nights to come! I don't want you out there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You can't protect me forever.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I need him more than I need you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We need you, boy.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Ha! Jon Snow.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Hush.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Don't talk.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Do you remember the cave? We should have stayed in the cave.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We'll go back there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Drop the scythe, boys! - Hoist her up.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 - Hoist her up! They've had enough for one night.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Don't cheer too loud.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They still outnumber us Tormund.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It's over.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Let it end.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 This is how a man ends.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Put him in chains.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We'll question him later.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I should have thrown you from the top of the Wall, boy! Aye.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You should have.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Whoa, it's me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It's me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 I promised you, didn't I? We held them off.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 For one night.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 This is a great victory.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 A great victory? Mance was testing our defenses.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He almost made it through.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And he has more giants.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He has more mammoths.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He has 1,000 times as many men.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They'll hit us again tonight.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we'll never beat them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Where are we going? Going to find Mance.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 To fi--- you can't do that.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 No one gave you any orders.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Who's left to give orders? The wildling army's only an army because of Mance.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 He united Without Mance, they lose their leader.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They lose their purpose.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They go back to fighting each other.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Scatter back to their homes.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Without Mance? You're going to kill him? I'm gonna try.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They'll never let you within 100 yards of him.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 And even if they did, even if you managed to kill him-- They'll kill me? If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They'll kill the rest of us, too.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They won't just kill you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They'll boil you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They'll flay you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 They'll make it last days.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 You're right.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 It's a bad plan.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What's your plan? They held the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Get some brothers down here to help you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 We need to burn the bodies.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Raise the outer gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 What are you doing? I promised Mormont I'd never lose it again.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 In case I don't come back.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Jon.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	 Come back.
s04e10	The Children	You're wearing a black cloak again.
s04e10	The Children	 I've been sent to negotiate with you.
s04e10	The Children	 It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.
s04e10	The Children	 It's happened before.
s04e10	The Children	 I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.
s04e10	The Children	 Truly I was.
s04e10	The Children	 The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black.
s04e10	The Children	 He made me kill him so you'd trust me.
s04e10	The Children	 I was loyal to him and to my Night's Watch vows.
s04e10	The Children	 All your vows? She wasn't enough to turn you, eh? Were you enough to turn her? She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
s04e10	The Children	 Did you see her again at Castle Black? - Yes.
s04e10	The Children	 - And? She's dead.
s04e10	The Children	 - Your doing? - No.
s04e10	The Children	 We'll drink to her.
s04e10	The Children	 Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last.
s04e10	The Children	 - Ygritte.
s04e10	The Children	 - Ygritte.
s04e10	The Children	 That's not wine.
s04e10	The Children	 No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.
s04e10	The Children	 You did well.
s04e10	The Children	 Fought hard.
s04e10	The Children	 Killed some of our strongest men.
s04e10	The Children	 One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again.
s04e10	The Children	 Mag the Mighty.
s04e10	The Children	 He's dead.
s04e10	The Children	 He killed my friend Grenn.
s04e10	The Children	 He was their king.
s04e10	The Children	 The last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
s04e10	The Children	 Grenn came from a farm.
s04e10	The Children	 - Mag and Grenn.
s04e10	The Children	 - Grenn and Mag.
s04e10	The Children	 Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything for quite some time.
s04e10	The Children	 So, you're here to strike a bargain? Turn your army around and go home.
s04e10	The Children	 You know I know you're low on arrows, you're low on oil, you're low on men.
s04e10	The Children	 How many are left, 50? I told Tormund and Orell.
s04e10	The Children	 We have more than 1,000 men.
s04e10	The Children	 I showed you everything I had.
s04e10	The Children	 The whole army, And what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had.
s04e10	The Children	 It wasn't much.
s04e10	The Children	 As soon as I saw that, I sent 400 men to climb the Wall, an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.
s04e10	The Children	 A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day.
s04e10	The Children	 It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me.
s04e10	The Children	 My people have bled enough.
s04e10	The Children	 We're not here to conquer.
s04e10	The Children	 We're here to hide behind your Wall.
s04e10	The Children	 Just like you.
s04e10	The Children	 We need your tunnel.
s04e10	The Children	 Now we both know that winter is coming.
s04e10	The Children	 And if my people aren't south of the Wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead.
s04e10	The Children	 You want to strike a bargain with me? Here's the bargain.
s04e10	The Children	 You go back, you open the gates to us, and I swear to you that no one else will die.
s04e10	The Children	 Refuse, and we'll kill every last man at Castle Black.
s04e10	The Children	 Ah! Oh, that's why you're here.
s04e10	The Children	 I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you.
s04e10	The Children	 They'd kill you, of course.
s04e10	The Children	 They'd kill you slow.
s04e10	The Children	 But you knew that when you came in here.
s04e10	The Children	 Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered you peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are? Riders coming! - Are you attacking us? - No.
s04e10	The Children	 It's like you said, we don't have the men.
s04e10	The Children	 Hold! To me! To me! Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
s04e10	The Children	 Round them up.
s04e10	The Children	 Stay with the horses.
s04e10	The Children	 You're the King-beyond-the-Wall? - Do you know who I am? - Never had the pleasure.
s04e10	The Children	 This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.
s04e10	The Children	 We're not in the Seven Kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
s04e10	The Children	 It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
s04e10	The Children	 We do not kneel.
s04e10	The Children	 I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.
s04e10	The Children	 Their fate depends on their king.
s04e10	The Children	 All the same, we do not kneel.
s04e10	The Children	 Take these men away.
s04e10	The Children	 What's a man of the Night's Watch doing in a wildling camp? I was sent to discuss terms with the King-beyond-the-Wall.
s04e10	The Children	 You're speaking to the one true king, boy.
s04e10	The Children	 You will address him as Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 I know he's the king.
s04e10	The Children	 My father died for him.
s04e10	The Children	 My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm Ned Stark's son.
s04e10	The Children	 Your father was an honorable man.
s04e10	The Children	 He was, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 What do you think he'd have done with him? I was this man's prisoner once.
s04e10	The Children	 He could have tortured me.
s04e10	The Children	 He could have killed me.
s04e10	The Children	 But he spared my life.
s04e10	The Children	 I think my father would have taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.
s04e10	The Children	 Very well, then.
s04e10	The Children	 Take him.
s04e10	The Children	 Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 If my father had seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.
s04e10	The Children	 All of them.
s04e10	The Children	 I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.
s04e10	The Children	 Bloody Martells.
s04e10	The Children	 The cause appears to be manticore venom.
s04e10	The Children	 It is.
s04e10	The Children	 The Death's Head manticore.
s04e10	The Children	 Yes, I've read a great deal about it.
s04e10	The Children	 It's a horrible poison.
s04e10	The Children	 Usually Mantari in origin.
s04e10	The Children	 Oh! Yes, yes.
s04e10	The Children	 There's nothing to be done.
s04e10	The Children	 Yes, there is.
s04e10	The Children	 May I ask what you think you're doing? Saving him.
s04e10	The Children	 Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.
s04e10	The Children	 Well, well beyond.
s04e10	The Children	 This man is not even a maester, let alone Grand Maester.
s04e10	The Children	 That's for the best.
s04e10	The Children	 No maester knows how to save him.
s04e10	The Children	 That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.
s04e10	The Children	 Rightly so, in my opinion.
s04e10	The Children	 You're dismissed, Grand Maester.
s04e10	The Children	 But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.
s04e10	The Children	 - Not anymore.
s04e10	The Children	 - But I-- - You can save him? - Difficult to say, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 But if my past work is any guide we stand a chance.
s04e10	The Children	 Do everything you can.
s04e10	The Children	 Come to me for anything you need.
s04e10	The Children	 Thank you, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 You should know, the process may change him somewhat.
s04e10	The Children	 Will it weaken him? Oh, no.
s04e10	The Children	 Very well, then.
s04e10	The Children	 Not another word.
s04e10	The Children	 We've been over this.
s04e10	The Children	 The matter's closed.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm opening it again.
s04e10	The Children	 You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
s04e10	The Children	 You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
s04e10	The Children	 And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
s04e10	The Children	 I will not.
s04e10	The Children	 Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.
s04e10	The Children	 Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow.
s04e10	The Children	 You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this family's future.
s04e10	The Children	 Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.
s04e10	The Children	 I don't care.
s04e10	The Children	 I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son the king.
s04e10	The Children	 When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital.
s04e10	The Children	 I decided to take your brother with me and not you.
s04e10	The Children	 You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
s04e10	The Children	 And if you recall-- I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won.
s04e10	The Children	 This isn't going to be one of those times.
s04e10	The Children	 Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will? When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle of Blackwater-- do you remember? I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.
s04e10	The Children	 I was about to give him essence of nightshade.
s04e10	The Children	 That's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away.
s04e10	The Children	 Someone awful is coming to take him away.
s04e10	The Children	 - No.
s04e10	The Children	 - Joffrey is dead.
s04e10	The Children	 Myrcella's been sold like livestock.
s04e10	The Children	 And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy.
s04e10	The Children	 My last boy.
s04e10	The Children	 Margaery will dig her claws in, you will dig your claws in and you'll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart.
s04e10	The Children	 I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.
s04e10	The Children	 And how will you do that? I'll tell everyone the truth.
s04e10	The Children	 What truth would that be? You don't know, do you? You never believed it.
s04e10	The Children	 How is that possible? What am I saying? Of course it's possible.
s04e10	The Children	 How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us.
s04e10	The Children	 One look in the past 20 years, one real look at your own children and you would have known.
s04e10	The Children	 Known what? Everything they say is true.
s04e10	The Children	 - About Jaime and me.
s04e10	The Children	 - No.
s04e10	The Children	 - Your legacy is a lie.
s04e10	The Children	 - No, no, no, no.
s04e10	The Children	 I don't believe you.
s04e10	The Children	 Yes, you do.
s04e10	The Children	 Jaime.
s04e10	The Children	 You won.
s04e10	The Children	 One fewer brother.
s04e10	The Children	 Must be proud of yourself.
s04e10	The Children	 There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there? For my family, no, nothing.
s04e10	The Children	 I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.
s04e10	The Children	 - Tyrion is your family.
s04e10	The Children	 - He's not.
s04e10	The Children	 - You don't get to choose.
s04e10	The Children	 - I do.
s04e10	The Children	 So do you.
s04e10	The Children	 You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-- Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her.
s04e10	The Children	 He was an infant.
s04e10	The Children	 A disease doesn't decide to kill you.
s04e10	The Children	 All the same, you cut it out before it does.
s04e10	The Children	 What do you decide? What do you choose? The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-- I choose you.
s04e10	The Children	 - Those are words.
s04e10	The Children	 - Yes.
s04e10	The Children	 Like the ones I just said to Father.
s04e10	The Children	 I told him.
s04e10	The Children	 Told him what? I told him about us.
s04e10	The Children	 You told him? I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.
s04e10	The Children	 I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.
s04e10	The Children	 You think he'll just accept that? Go and ask him.
s04e10	The Children	 What did you say? I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.
s04e10	The Children	 I don't choose Tywin Lannister.
s04e10	The Children	 I don't love Tywin Lannister.
s04e10	The Children	 I love my brother.
s04e10	The Children	 I love my lover.
s04e10	The Children	 People will whisper, they'll make their jokes.
s04e10	The Children	 Let them.
s04e10	The Children	 They're all so small, I can't even see them.
s04e10	The Children	 I only see what matters.
s04e10	The Children	 Someone will walk in.
s04e10	The Children	 I don't care.
s04e10	The Children	 I can speak the common tongue if you wish.
s04e10	The Children	 You speak it very well.
s04e10	The Children	 Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.
s04e10	The Children	 I was tutor to his children.
s04e10	The Children	 I taught them languages and history.
s04e10	The Children	 They know a great deal about your family because of me.
s04e10	The Children	 Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.
s04e10	The Children	 I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.
s04e10	The Children	 What can I do for you? When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house.
s04e10	The Children	 But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.
s04e10	The Children	 So I lost my home.
s04e10	The Children	 Now I live on the streets.
s04e10	The Children	 I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
s04e10	The Children	 I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 I went to one of these places.
s04e10	The Children	 The young prey on the old.
s04e10	The Children	 Take what they want and beat us if we resist.
s04e10	The Children	 My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order, my friend, this I promise you.
s04e10	The Children	 Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher.
s04e10	The Children	 I had the respect and love of his children.
s04e10	The Children	 What is it that you want from me? Your Grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
s04e10	The Children	 You want to return to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair? Please, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them, but for those of us too old to change, there is only fear and squalor.
s04e10	The Children	 I am not alone.
s04e10	The Children	 There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.
s04e10	The Children	 I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy.
s04e10	The Children	 I took it to bring people freedom.
s04e10	The Children	 But freedom means making your own choices.
s04e10	The Children	 I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master.
s04e10	The Children	 It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
s04e10	The Children	 Thank you, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 Thank you.
s04e10	The Children	 The masters will take advantage of this situation.
s04e10	The Children	 The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
s04e10	The Children	 Approach, my friend.
s04e10	The Children	 I have brought you-- He came from the sky.
s04e10	The Children	 The black one.
s04e10	The Children	 The winged shadow.
s04e10	The Children	 He came from the sky and My girl.
s04e10	The Children	 My little girl.
s04e10	The Children	 What was her name? Zala, Your Grace.
s04e10	The Children	 - How old was she? - Three.
s04e10	The Children	 Three.
s04e10	The Children	 They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west.
s04e10	The Children	 They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names.
s04e10	The Children	 It is for us to remember them.
s04e10	The Children	 Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.
s04e10	The Children	 And now their watch is ended.
s04e10	The Children	 And now their watch is ended.
s04e10	The Children	 Your old blind man patched me up.
s04e10	The Children	 Why? He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.
s04e10	The Children	 You want me alive so you can torture me? No one's gonna torture you.
s04e10	The Children	 So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the Wall? I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
s04e10	The Children	 Who decides? I suppose Stannis does.
s04e10	The Children	 He your king now? I don't have a king.
s04e10	The Children	 You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.
s04e10	The Children	 You can never be a kneeler again.
s04e10	The Children	 We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead.
s04e10	The Children	 Do you want to say any words over them? Words? What kind of words? Funeral words.
s04e10	The Children	 I don't know how the free folk do it.
s04e10	The Children	 Do what? Say farewell.
s04e10	The Children	 The dead can't hear us, boy.
s04e10	The Children	 Snow.
s04e10	The Children	 Did you love her? She loved you.
s04e10	The Children	 She told you? No.
s04e10	The Children	 All she ever talked about was killing you.
s04e10	The Children	 That's how I know.
s04e10	The Children	 She belongs in the North.
s04e10	The Children	 The real North.
s04e10	The Children	 You understand me? We can stop.
s04e10	The Children	 We can rest.
s04e10	The Children	 We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.
s04e10	The Children	 We're not going to make it.
s04e10	The Children	 We're already here.
s04e10	The Children	 Jojen.
s04e10	The Children	 Jojen.
s04e10	The Children	 Look, Jojen.
s04e10	The Children	 Look.
s04e10	The Children	 Jojen! Come on! Help them! Now! Hold on to me! Hang on! - Hodor.
s04e10	The Children	 - Help them! Hodor.
s04e10	The Children	 Hodor! Hodor! Hodor.
s04e10	The Children	 Hodor! Bran! Save yourself, now! Come with me, Brandon Stark.
s04e10	The Children	 He is lost.
s04e10	The Children	 Come with me or die with him.
s04e10	The Children	 Go with them.
s04e10	The Children	 They cannot follow us.
s04e10	The Children	 The power that moves them is powerless here.
s04e10	The Children	 Who are you? The First Men called us the children, but we were born long before them.
s04e10	The Children	 Come, he waits for you.
s04e10	The Children	 You're the three-eyed raven? I've been many things.
s04e10	The Children	 Now I am what you see.
s04e10	The Children	 My brother, he led us to you and now he-- He knew what would happen.
s04e10	The Children	 From the moment he left, he knew and he went anyway.
s04e10	The Children	 How do you know? I've been watching you.
s04e10	The Children	 All of you.
s04e10	The Children	 All of your lives.
s04e10	The Children	 With 1,000 eyes and one.
s04e10	The Children	 Now you've come to me at last, Brandon Stark.
s04e10	The Children	 Though the hour is late.
s04e10	The Children	 I didn't want anyone to die for me.
s04e10	The Children	 He died so you could find what you have lost.
s04e10	The Children	 You're going to help me walk again? You will never walk again.
s04e10	The Children	 But you will fly.
s04e10	The Children	 Podrick.
s04e10	The Children	 Podrick.
s04e10	The Children	 Where are the horses? I hobbled them last night.
s04e10	The Children	 What sort of hobble? A figure eight like you taught me.
s04e10	The Children	 If you did it like I taught you, then the horses would be here.
s04e10	The Children	 Thieves, maybe? It's at least 30 miles to the Eyrie from here.
s04e10	The Children	 You're carrying the saddlebags.
s04e10	The Children	 People coming.
s04e10	The Children	 You can shit later.
s04e10	The Children	 There's people coming.
s04e10	The Children	 Morning.
s04e10	The Children	 Morning.
s04e10	The Children	 I like your sword.
s04e10	The Children	 Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate? About 10 more miles.
s04e10	The Children	 Did you hear that, Podrick? Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.
s04e10	The Children	 Are you a knight? No.
s04e10	The Children	 But you know how to use that sword? I do.
s04e10	The Children	 Does it have a name? Oathkeeper.
s04e10	The Children	 Mine's Needle.
s04e10	The Children	 Good name.
s04e10	The Children	 Who taught you how to fight? My father.
s04e10	The Children	 Mine never wanted to.
s04e10	The Children	 Said fighting was for boys.
s04e10	The Children	 Mine said the same.
s04e10	The Children	 But I kept fighting the boys anyway.
s04e10	The Children	 Kept losing.
s04e10	The Children	 Finally my father said, "If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right.
s04e10	The Children	" Seven blessings.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm Brienne of Tarth.
s04e10	The Children	 This is Podrick Payne.
s04e10	The Children	 You want something? That's Sandor Clegane.
s04e10	The Children	 The Hound.
s04e10	The Children	 You're Arya Stark.
s04e10	The Children	 I asked if you wanted something.
s04e10	The Children	 I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
s04e10	The Children	 My mother's dead.
s04e10	The Children	 I know.
s04e10	The Children	 I wish I could have been there to protect her.
s04e10	The Children	 You're not a northerner.
s04e10	The Children	 No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.
s04e10	The Children	 Why didn't you? She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.
s04e10	The Children	 You're paid by the Lannisters.
s04e10	The Children	 You're here for the bounty on me.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm not paid by the Lannisters.
s04e10	The Children	 No? Fancy sword you've got there.
s04e10	The Children	 Where'd you get it? I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life.
s04e10	The Children	 Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.
s04e10	The Children	 Tell me that's not Lannister gold.
s04e10	The Children	 Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
s04e10	The Children	 The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.
s04e10	The Children	 I swore to your mother by the old gods-- I don't care what you swore.
s04e10	The Children	 - Arya! - You heard the girl.
s04e10	The Children	 - She's not coming with you.
s04e10	The Children	 - She is.
s04e10	The Children	 You're not a good listener.
s04e10	The Children	 That Valyrian steel? I always wanted some Valyrian steel.
s04e10	The Children	 Come with me, Arya.
s04e10	The Children	 I'll take you to safety.
s04e10	The Children	 Safety? Where the fuck's that? Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.
s04e10	The Children	 Her mother's dead.
s04e10	The Children	 Her father's dead.
s04e10	The Children	 Her brother's dead.
s04e10	The Children	 Winterfell is a pile of rubble.
s04e10	The Children	 There is no safety, you dumb bitch.
s04e10	The Children	 You don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her.
s04e10	The Children	 And that's what you're doing? Watching over her? Aye, that's what I'm doing.
s04e10	The Children	 I have no wish to kill you, Ser.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm not a knight.
s04e10	The Children	 Arya! Arya! Arya! - Where is she? - She was just here.
s04e10	The Children	 Why weren't you watching her? I was watching you.
s04e10	The Children	 I thought you might need some help.
s04e10	The Children	 Which way, Pod? Which way did she go? I think that way.
s04e10	The Children	 Arya! Arya! You still here? Big bitch saved you.
s04e10	The Children	 I don't need saving.
s04e10	The Children	 No, not you.
s04e10	The Children	 You're a real killer.
s04e10	The Children	 With your water dancing and your Needle.
s04e10	The Children	 You gonna die? Unless there's a maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I'm done.
s04e10	The Children	 I'd skin you alive for wine.
s04e10	The Children	 Fuck water.
s04e10	The Children	 Killed by a woman.
s04e10	The Children	 I bet you like that.
s04e10	The Children	 Go on, go after her.
s04e10	The Children	 She'll help you.
s04e10	The Children	 Going it alone, you won't last a day out there.
s04e10	The Children	 I'll last longer than you.
s04e10	The Children	 You remember where the heart is? Fuck it.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm ready.
s04e10	The Children	 Go on, girl.
s04e10	The Children	 Another name off your list.
s04e10	The Children	 You kept promising me.
s04e10	The Children	 I cut down your butcher's boy.
s04e10	The Children	 The ginger.
s04e10	The Children	 He was begging for mercy.
s04e10	The Children	 "Please, Ser.
s04e10	The Children	 Please don't kill me.
s04e10	The Children	 Please, please.
s04e10	The Children	" Bled all over my horse.
s04e10	The Children	 Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks.
s04e10	The Children	 And your sister.
s04e10	The Children	 Your pretty sister.
s04e10	The Children	 I should have taken her.
s04e10	The Children	 That night the Blackwater burned.
s04e10	The Children	 I should have fucked her bloody.
s04e10	The Children	 At least I'd have one happy memory.
s04e10	The Children	 Do I have to beg you? Do it.
s04e10	The Children	 Do it.
s04e10	The Children	 Do it.
s04e10	The Children	 Kill me.
s04e10	The Children	 Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.
s04e10	The Children	 Is that any way to speak about our mother? What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? A galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
s04e10	The Children	 - Who's helping you? - Varys.
s04e10	The Children	 - Varys? - You have more friends than you thought.
s04e10	The Children	 There's a locked door at the top of the stairs.
s04e10	The Children	 Knock on it twice, then twice again.
s04e10	The Children	 Varys will open.
s04e10	The Children	 I suppose this is good-bye, then.
s04e10	The Children	 Farewell, little brother.
s04e10	The Children	 Jaime.
s04e10	The Children	 Thank you for my life.
s04e10	The Children	 Quickly now.
s04e10	The Children	 Tywin? My lion.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm sorry.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm sorry.
s04e10	The Children	 Tyrion.
s04e10	The Children	 Put down the crossbow.
s04e10	The Children	 Who released you? Your brother, I expect.
s04e10	The Children	 He always had a soft spot for you.
s04e10	The Children	 Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers.
s04e10	The Children	 This is how you want to speak to me, hmm? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure.
s04e10	The Children	 All my life you've wanted me dead.
s04e10	The Children	 Yes.
s04e10	The Children	 But you refused to die.
s04e10	The Children	 I respect that.
s04e10	The Children	 Even admire it.
s04e10	The Children	 You fight for what's yours.
s04e10	The Children	 I'd never let them execute you.
s04e10	The Children	 Is that what you fear? I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.
s04e10	The Children	 You're a Lannister.
s04e10	The Children	 You're my son.
s04e10	The Children	 I loved her.
s04e10	The Children	 Who? Shae.
s04e10	The Children	 Oh, Tyrion.
s04e10	The Children	 - Put down that crossbow.
s04e10	The Children	 - I murdered her.
s04e10	The Children	 With my own hands.
s04e10	The Children	 - It doesn't matter.
s04e10	The Children	 - Doesn't matter? She was a whore.
s04e10	The Children	 - Say that word again - And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No.
s04e10	The Children	 You're my son.
s04e10	The Children	 Now, enough of this nonsense.
s04e10	The Children	 I am your son and you sentenced me to die.
s04e10	The Children	 You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same.
s04e10	The Children	 - Why? - Enough.
s04e10	The Children	 We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
s04e10	The Children	 I can't go back there.
s04e10	The Children	 She's in there.
s04e10	The Children	 You're afraid of a dead whore? You shot me.
s04e10	The Children	 You're no son of mine.
s04e10	The Children	 I am your son.
s04e10	The Children	 I have always been your son.
s04e10	The Children	 What have you done? Quickly.
s04e10	The Children	 Trust me, my friend.
s04e10	The Children	 I brought you this far.
s04e10	The Children	 I want to see the captain.
s04e10	The Children	 You're seeing him.
s04e10	The Children	 I want to go north to the Wall.
s04e10	The Children	 No, you don't.
s04e10	The Children	 I can pay.
s04e10	The Children	 There is nothing in the North but ice and war and pirates.
s04e10	The Children	 I wouldn't need a cabin.
s04e10	The Children	 Please.
s04e10	The Children	 I could work scrubbing the floors.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm not going north, child.
s04e10	The Children	 I'm going home.
s04e10	The Children	 - Where's home? - The Free City of Braavos.
s04e10	The Children	 Wait.
s04e10	The Children	 I have something else.
s04e10	The Children	 More silver won't make a difference.
s04e10	The Children	 It's not silver.
s04e10	The Children	 It's iron.
s04e10	The Children	 This How did you-- Valar morghulis.
s04e10	The Children	 Valar dohaeris.
s04e10	The Children	 Of course, you shall have a cabin.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	( music playing )  Duncan Muggoch: Although this is TV,  it's TV in a scale that is beyond anything else.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Peter Welter Soler: It's the most successful TV show in the world right now.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It is special.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Very, very special.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Chris Newman: Today we're shooting in Croatia,  they're shooting in Belfast,  and they're preparing for shooting in Seville down in Spain.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Whatever hand you're dealt, you have to go with it  because the show can't stop.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Bernie Caulfield: I think we're the only ones in the world  that shoot with two units  at the same time all season long.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  If one of those spokes in the wheel are missing,  it's gonna collapse.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Director: And, action!  ( crowd cheering )   Morning.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  How are you all?  My name is Duncan Muggoch and I'm the UK line producer  for Croatia and Spain, or what we also call  the southern locations for "Game of Thrones" season five.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  This is my second season.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 I did Croatia last year.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And this year we've obviously got Spain thrown into it as well.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So I'm line producing both of them this year.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And even though last year was big, this one's even bigger.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  My name is Chris Newman.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 I'm one of the producers on "Game of Thrones.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	"  I fulfill a function here of planning how the two units work  and drift in between the sets, the locations, and the different countries.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So how was yesterday? All right?  - Yes.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Yeah, it was good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 It was really good, yeah.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Yes? Good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Newman: We start shooting at the end of July.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  99% of the crew have been here before.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So when you start day one,  it feels like day 301  in a good way.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  As this is going on here, over in Spain  we have Peter who runs Fresco Films.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  He's new to this year, so he doesn't know quite how manic it can get.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  My name is Peter Welter Soler.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I'm the Spanish line producer on this show.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  The production booklets, are we getting them tonight?  Welter Soler: We have two weeks left before everybody arrives.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And then two days later, we start shooting.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I'd be lying if I said the stress level is not increasing,  because obviously this is very important for all of us.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Doing it for the first time, we want to please everybody.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We want to do a great job.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  This is actually maybe not the calm before the storm.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It is the rehearsal before the show.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 ( chuckles )  We're heading from our unit base into Dubrovnik, into the old town.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Filming here is quite different from filming in Belfast  'cause the logistics over here are very different.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  One of the logistical problems of Dubrovnik  is it's such a tight, small, old city  that we can't get our big vehicles actually into the town  just 'cause the streets are so narrow.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's just one of the challenges that we face  filming in a city like this.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You can't take vehicles within the old walls,  so everything has to get taken by Sherpas  up to a location today which is probably  one of the furthest and trickiest you could get to in the whole city.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  A little rule that I have for myself on location,  and this is never go up empty-handed or come down empty-handed.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Now it's just a load of stairs all the way up to the top.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Hello, gorgeous.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Good, good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Muggoch: The principal actors are just arriving on set  to rehearse.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  They will do a rehearsal with the director first,  and then they'll do a full crew rehearsal,  which is when they'll place where the cameras are gonna go and everything like that.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Man: Okay, guys, give us the set, please.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Hey, Joseph.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 How are you? Nice to see you.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Newman: Episode one and two have been in Croatia.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  They've done most of their filming and they're back here finishing up  now that Emilia has finished in Croatia.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( growling )  - Do that.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Just growl at one point.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - ( growls )  So this morning, episode one and two with Mike Slovis directing  are setting up to do their first scene this season in Dany's penthouse.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Morning, everybody.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Hello.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Newman: So it's right at the beginning of the-- season five  and it's the first time Dany gets an inkling  of what's going on in Meereen under her new rule.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And then do you want it to be a boom,  I've decided I will not have them?  Or do you want it to be kind of like--  - No, I think it's more gentle.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - It's gentle?  It is gentle? Okay, lovely.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Yeah.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I have shot mostly in Belfast.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I have shot several days in Croatia  and I am going to shoot in Seville.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Teach them a better way.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It sounds like something Jorah would have said.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Slovis: Moving to a foreign country on this show  is not as disruptive as you might think  because one of the two crews  that you've already worked with here goes there.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So the first thing that happens when you walk on the set  is that you see familiar faces.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Kay Bilk: My priority today is looking after Emilia  because she's come from Croatia,  so we're matching continuity to that country.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  They send their photos to us  so that we can do the same as they've been doing.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Rosalia Culora: There's two departments filming at the same time,  so it's imperative that things like wigs,  continuity photos all travel together  and that every member of the team is aware of what the look is,  because if we do have to take over someone's artist,  we know exactly what we're doing and there's no mess-ups  when we're watching the show, hopefully.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Slovis: Let's do one for camera, please.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Okay.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Man: Let's have it quiet for rehearsal, please.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And that means everybody in here, thank you.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Action.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So the only thing that gave him pride  was knowing there was someone lower than he was.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Morning.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Morning.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - How are you? - Good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Morning, Duncan.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Morning, Mr.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Muggoch.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Morning.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Oh, I want to talk to Peter today or maybe you can.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Peter Welter? Yeah, no, I'm talking with him.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  About Córdoba bridge and the drone.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Muggoch: As far as I'm concerned, Bernie is "Game of Thrones.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	"  I've never met a producer that cares for a crew as much as she does.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  She's an incredible woman to work for, actually,  and everybody loves her.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And she keeps everything together.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And do they want to clear a place in that?  So the bridge has to be closed.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  That's-- I'm checking on.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Along with David and Dan, she's the executive producer.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  David and Dan are obviously-- you know, they're the creators of it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's their baby.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Bernie is the one that keeps this show running.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Sometimes David and Dan will be with us.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Sometimes they are separate so that they can both be on the set,  depending what the scene might be,  will watch rehearsal, give their notes on the scene,  and then a lot of times we're discussing what is in advance.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  As you can imagine, with 10 episodes,  that we're constantly prepping.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Much like our characters, we will go from the amazing Daznak  right into the amazing Hardhome.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Caulfield: I usually have a nice list for them every day.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  They almost cringe when they see me starting to come towards them  and open my book to start asking my questions.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  But they're fantastically collaborative with all of us.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Today, they're having a big Hardhome meeting up in Belfast.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - They got the notes? - Yes.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Yeah.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Caulfield: When we're shooting in different countries,  it's about a constant communication  between the producers in each country.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I'm gonna follow Nutter over to Spain early.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You're staying here through Illyrio's, right?  Are we doing a charter to Sevilla?  We are, yes, but I'm going to leave ahead of time.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Yeah, which goes on the 8th.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I'll go on the charter this time.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Hope there's a seat for me.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - There'll be a seat for you.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You can have Bernie's seat.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 ( laughs )  In a week, we will all take off in a charter  to go to Spain and that is now starting to come very close.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  After they have their big scout today,  then we'll have more information to go off of for that.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( birds chirping )  Welter Soler: We're in the royal palaces of Seville  called the Real Alcázar, which are palaces built  by Peter the Horrible in the 13th century.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's one of the most visited monuments in Spain.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  The Alcázar will be, like, the water gardens of Dorne.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Since Dorne is a new world that's just come into the show--  it was introduced in the fourth season,  but we didn't really see it--  now in the fifth season, they will finally get to see  the Kingdom of Dorne.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - ( speaking Spanish ) - Good morning once again.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: It is difficult to shoot in a place like that  because it was obviously not built as a set,  but built for a purpose, a different purpose than ours.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( speaking Spanish )  Some of the places, as you see in the balcony, for instance,  I mean, you can't possibly get some of the gear up there  because the staircase is too narrow.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So we have to get a crane in--  Genie Booms, cranes, platforms--  in order to haul that material up there.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( speaking Spanish )  - It's tricky, you know? - Okay.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's not like a back lot studio shoot.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  First and second shooting day is up here.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And then we move down to the garden.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We'll get control of the garden, I'm assuming?  As far as you told me, we have the entire garden area for us, correct?  - Yes, I have this note here.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - It's pretty amazing.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: They have, like, an average of 8,000 tourists in here every day.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  To see it, like, empty and have it just for us is just a privilege.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Wherever you go, there's always gonna be a challenge  because you're in a new place both culturally and logistically.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We'll have to find a compromise  where we can work together with the palace.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We're the foreigners coming into their country,  trying to put this project together.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I have to say they're being extremely nice,  which is-- so we need to make sure that our--  which they always are-- but our crew are very careful  in this delicate location.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: And what they're doing for us is unique as well.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's never been locked off like this for anybody.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  All right, so will you go and check the others?  - Sure.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Because I think we're running a bit late now.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We're now driving up to a little village called Magheramorne  in which there is a quarry that's been there for a number of years now.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And in season one  we built the set of Castle Black there.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Because there's a lake in the quarry,  in season two we built the battlements of King's Landing  for the Battle of Blackwater  with Stannis's boats attacking.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's still standing, although it's looking a bit worn these days.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Now we're driving up to have a look at a set mid-construction  of a fishing village set north of the Wall.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We'll begin to see how that's taking shape this morning.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  The set that we see down here,  it's a fishing village that is a protected fishing village.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's not a military establishment.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It was designed to be somewhere where people  had a living off the sea.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So we needed the water, which is why we put it  on the edge of the reservoir here.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  The fantastic thing about the Hardhome set  is we're building something that is so far north this time  that what we get to do is create a fishing village  that is exactly as the name describes.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's Hardhome.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 What we've been doing  both in concepts and in models  is looking at the location out in Magheramorne  and created what we need for the action,  which is a longhouse in which a lot of action takes place.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And then we have the landing area,  which we're able to use the lake that exists in Magheramorne.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And so through having those sort of necessary requirements,  we can then build this sort of tent city  that will be created out there.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So I had this good idea,  which I need to pitch, I guess,  which is to hold onto that shot.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Miguel Sapochnik: The director can now see the bones of the whole set,  so he's gonna walk through the set and start mapping out  where all the things that he's imagined will take place.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  If the plan to do that shot-- it's the boater's point of view,  so it's looking through the fence.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Sapochnik: So anything at this point  that the director would like to change,  this is the time that he has to turn around and say,  "Well, could I put the door in the hut over here?"  and, "Could I have this a bit higher?" or so on.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Good, so, yeah, we good with this?  - Yeah.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Rock and roll, so  - shall we have a look - Look at this edge here and see if that works.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Newman: "Game of Thrones" is a big event,  and what you mustn't do  is get put off by the bigness of it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  The thing to do is to come in and say,  "All I've got to worry about is the 16x9.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  What's in that frame.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	" It must be like parachuting.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Don't worry about the height you're jumping,  just make sure the parachute works.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( crew chatting )  It doesn't have to be a sparrow.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Muggoch: Today we've got about 128 extras out  and then everything that goes with that,  which is the extra hair people, makeup people,  costume people that have to deal with all of that.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Nina Ayres: Crowds start dressing about 5:00 this morning.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And then just in conjunction with hair and makeup,  we're just sort of working around each other.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And then everybody travelled to set about 7:30  to be all set for 8:00.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Just need to take your blankets off, guys,  so we can look at your costumes, please.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Muggoch: Mark Mylod is the director,  and he's now going to select the extras  that he wants to feature in the scene.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Yep, this gentleman.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 And one other lady.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It changed a bit this morning because people had to look  a bit poorer than we'd originally intended.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I'd just like to maybe darken a couple of teeth or something.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  A bit of the teeth black, you know, just one or two of those.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And maybe-- okay, the skin's pretty good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Just a little less healthy.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And so it was a bit of a scramble trying to get everybody  broken down enough to look a bit poorer than they had done.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And it's still happening.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  People are still getting dirtied up as we speak.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Thank you, guys.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Well done.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Brilliant.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Thank you.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 See you soon.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Thank you.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We had more than 86,000 applications  to be a background extra in the show.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  People from not only all over Spain,  but all over Europe, even from California,  from Argentina, from South Africa,  wanting to come to the casting,  wanting to be part of "Game of Thrones.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	"  - Hello.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - How are you?  - Good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Peter.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Buenos días.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Buenos días.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Buenas tardes.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Oh, buenas tardes.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Buenas tardes is the afternoon.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Maybe you just got up.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I just had a siesta.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Okay, then it's good morning again.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Thank you.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  There's gonna be about 1,000 costumes to do 600 extras.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Stephen O'Rawe: Because it's such a major operation,  we're doing something like 50, 60 fittings a day, which normally we do 30.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We fit everybody here, males, females, in and out.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We do guards, slaves.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 There's a rogue slave.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: There's a slave over there.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Hello, slave.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  O'Rawe: They process down here  and these guys put on the hair.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Jenny puts on makeup and they do their magic.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We're moving around very quickly.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We're shooting in three or four different places  all straight after each other.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  But we, like, have to go in advance and prep 600, 700 people  all ready for a camera that moves behind us.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We're basically set here.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I like when things are just smooth.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Muggoch: We've got Lena Headey and Jonathan Pryce today.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We're shooting a scene here from episode three  which is a kind of rundown area,  behind the Sept of Baelor.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And it's a scene where Cersei is looking  to have a conversation with the High Sparrow  who is a whole new character.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We've got a beautiful courtyard  which is actually a former convent.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And we are disguising it with a lot of awnings  and a lot of ground cover on the floor.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And it's supposed to be a really shocking place  where Cersei encounters the poverty  that she has managed to ignore for most of her time  living in King's Landing.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I'm standing there looking butch and macho.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - I do a lot of that.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Man: Can you show us?  - That's it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 That's it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - There's no  - No jiggling? - No, that's it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  If I jiggle, I sound like "Jingle Bells.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	"  So I can't actually move.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 I'm not allowed to move.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I have to stand still.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Muggoch: From walking about, we're in every street there is.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's only started a few days ago,  so we haven't been here long enough yet  to really cause chaos, but it'll come.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Dubrovnik is understandably a big tourist attraction,  so you're normally fighting through the crowds.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  That's been a difficulty on the sets.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Rolling! Nice and quiet.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( speaks Croatian )  - Roll camera.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Rolling!  - Rolling! - Sound speed.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  17, take one, C marker only.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And, action!  I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 These are deeply religious people.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Where can I find the High Sparrow?  ( man coughs )  - Director: Cut.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Cut.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Man: Cut!  - Why did you do that? - I don't believe you did that!  Are you all right?  - Wanker.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - That's it, we're on strike.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  No, we're on strike.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Fuck you.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Go on.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You get into the fucking pelican.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 See how you like it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( groans )  ( coughs ) No?  - Cut.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - You know what?  I can't even lift-- I can't lift my arm  - 'cause it's like a T-rex.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Hit me, come on.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You think you're fucking tough? Come on.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Come on, harder.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Come on, harder.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( bell tolling )  Newman: Belfast remains the heart of the whole thing.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's a major city, so we have all the things  that a big film crew need.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  But, you know, you drive 20 minutes out of the city  and you're in the heart of the countryside.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It helps with the ancient feel of the show  that the landscape has a feeling of being old.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's been worn down and eroded.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And everything has that ancient feel to it no matter where you go.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You know, the woods feel old, the cliff tops feel old,  and the moorlands certainly look old, you know.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I always like to go to the set every day  because that's been my heart.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  This is my 40th year in the film business  and my heart has always been in making a film.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I've always loved the set.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You can always kind of tell how the day is going  by the way Chris is standing and looking at everyone around set.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( laughing )  Newman: I have no idea.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Some of them look at my face  and think if it's looking very long, we must be in trouble,  but that's not the case.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I might be thinking about something entirely different.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I always find him very calm and very relaxed  given that he's producing this massive, epic show.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Newman: We shoot this year 120 days.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  But in those 120 days, we do shoot two units,  so you double it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You're effectively shooting 240 days of screen time.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( speaking Valyrian )  Today on set I'm mostly concerned with the Valyrian.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We have a scene with the Valyrian language in,  so I'm looking after the actors  and making sure that they feel comfortable with their lines.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  'Cause some of the sounds are quite tricky to get through.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Director: All right, guys.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Here we go.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Shooting.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Let's have it quiet.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Let's roll cameras, please.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Man: Rolling.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Director: Action.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  I didn't conquer them.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Their own people did.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( man speaking Valyrian )  ( speaking Valyrian )  Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Your Grace.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - And cut it.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Let's go one more time.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Hey, Sean, I think  Welter Soler: Right now, we are in a town called Osuna.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And it has this beautiful old bull ring  and it's a national monument as well.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  When we walked into this bull ring,  it was just the place they were looking for.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  The stone is quite similar to the stone they have shot in Croatia.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Made some great progress.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Yes.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: This does not have to be a bull ring.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It needs to be something completely different,  and that's why we need to transform it into that place.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Building the balcony where the actors are going to go to the ground.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We had to cover up all the pillars.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  There will be a lot of things added to that.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We're shooting just one single scene in here  and it's 12 days.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 It's quite complex.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  There's a lot of action happening and we need that time.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  The pressure is so high to meet the expectancies  of what is involved in there.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It was just incredible.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  All right, ladies and gents, thank you very much.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - That's a wrap for today.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - ( bell rings )  Quiet down, people.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Listen, clear the cameras,  clear the lights, the equipment.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Newman: Here was a very stable,  interesting day for the character Daenerys.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And then, of course, we had the big trip out to see the set of Hardhome  and it did open up a lot of questions  which will continue to be looked at in weeks to come.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  You do the best you can, get everything as ready as you can,  and then you cross your fingers.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Caulfield: Today went very well.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We finished our work.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 David and Dan were happy,  which is always my goal of the day  when they come out with a smile.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Chris and I will talk and compare notes.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Another two days down.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 That's the beauty of shooting two units every day.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  It's the only job that can live two days in one.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( laughs )  Muggoch: At the moment, the main thing I'm thinking about  is getting out of Croatia.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  We've got a lot of stuff to move to Spain,  so that's where all my thought is going at the moment.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And obviously trying to set up Spain at the same time.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Yeah.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And getting through every day of filming.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( chuckles ) And knowing that there's big scenes coming up.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Yeah.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Man: So it doesn't stop?  No, it doesn't stop, no.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: Every day there are things that you don't expect.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Not having shot with any of the crew before  obviously increases the stress level.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Hello, Croatia.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 - Muggoch: Hello, Spain.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  So, how is it all going?  Welter Soler: As much as the shooting date is moving closer  and everybody is aware more and more of the fact  that we have less time,  yeah, stress level is increasing.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Definitely.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	 Definitely.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: Production arriving in the past 10 days  was actually very good.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  There was a lot of people rolling up.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  There's probably 450 people working behind the camera.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Director: All right, let's roll cameras, please.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  - Man: Rolling! - Man #2: Let's roll camera!  - ( clapper snaps ) - Director: And background action.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  Welter Soler: The first day of shooting is always crucial to us  because it shows us if everything we did  in order to prepare it was the right thing.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  ( crowd cheering )  ( shouting )  Director: Okay, here we go.
s05e00	A Day in the Life	  And, action!  ( shouting )  This year, Belfast has got some big sets like Hardhome  and the art department and construction have done a really great job  of turning what was a notion into reality.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	A royal wedding is history.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He's choking! Joffrey! - Come with me now.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Joffrey! He poisoned my son.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Take him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Take him! You're safe with me and sailing home.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your brother is dead.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Do you know what that means? It means I'll become king.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Yes.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Now, as the king, you will have to marry.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I demand a trial by combat.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Tyrion Lannister, you are hereby sentenced to death.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He came from the sky.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My girl.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My little girl.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Myrcella is my only daughter.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Dorne is the safest place for her.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're Arya Stark.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'll take you to safety.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Arya! Arya! Ser Lancel, Cersei must have great trust in you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Get back to bed.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 More wine, Your Grace? A boar got me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 have defended this castle.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 She will not fall tonight.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Let's kill some crows! - We shouldn't be out here alone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Why not? - If your father - He'll never know we're gone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But if he finds out You don't need to be afraid of my father.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Are you sure? Yes.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - We shouldn't go in.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Of course we should.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Get out.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Get out! - Let's go.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - No.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Listen to your friend.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They said that you were terrifying with cat's teeth and three eyes.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're not terrifying.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're boring.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You don't know what I am.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I know you're a witch and you can see the future.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Tell me mine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Everyone wants to know their future until they know their future.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 This is my father's land.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My land.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your blood.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Give me a taste.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Three questions you get.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You won't like the answers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I've been promised to the prince.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 When will we marry? You will never wed the prince.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You will wed the king.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But I will be queen? Oh, yes.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You'll be queen.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 For a time.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 W-will the king and I have children? No.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The king will have 20 children and you will have three.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That doesn't make sense.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Gold will be their crowns.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Gold their shrouds.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Come on, we have to go.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We have to go! Cersei! Bearers, put it down.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Bearers, up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your Grace, we are honored by your presence.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The mourners are waiting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They will keep waiting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I want a moment alone with him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But, Your Grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They will wait.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What he built, it's ours.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He built it for us.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He meant it for us.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They're going to try to take it away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - All of it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - They? All of them out there, our enemies.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They're waiting in line to make sure he's really dead.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And as soon as they see the stones on his eyes, they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They have nothing to do with it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He's the enemy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I've been telling you for years.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You've been defending him for years.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 This is exactly what they want.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Did you set him free? Tyrion may be a monster, but at least he killed our father on purpose.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You killed him by mistake.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 With stupidity.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something, you do it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Never mind the consequences.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Take a look.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Look at the consequences.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Here they are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He loved you more than anyone in this world.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Apologies.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I saved your life.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If they catch you, they catch me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that fucking crate.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those airholes? No, I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Pentos? The home of my colleague Illyrio Mopatis, a merchant.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He and I met many years ago through mutual friends.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting a Targaryen restoration.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Things have gotten worse, not better.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Westeros needs to be saved from itself.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Mmm.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Much better.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My lord? I don't think I am anymore.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A lord.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't imagine they revoke your nobility for killing a whore.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 It must happen all the time.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 In a box.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Why stop now? Because we are talking about the future of our country.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The future is shit.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Just like the past.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 _ _ _ _ _ Shh.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Shh.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The Sons of the Harpy? Yes, Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They left it on the body.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They've never killed before.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Conquerors always meet with resistance.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I didn't conquer them.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Their own people did.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 _ _ He did not risk his life fighting for his freedom so cowards in masks could take it away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What was the name of the man you lost? White Rat, Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I want him buried with honor, publically in the Temple of the Graces.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Make them very angry.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Angry snakes lash out.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Makes chopping off their heads that much easier.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Torgo Nudho.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Missandei hin Naath.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I wanted to speak with you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Why do you come? White Rat, the Unsullied who I have heard they found his body in a brothel.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel? I do not know.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I must go.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Get your shield up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - It's too heavy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Now get it up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Come.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Try it again.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Drive at me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Keep your shield up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Shouldn't you be training, too? Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 How many brothers can say that they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Shield up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - These men need a firm hand.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Always have.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They're poachers and thieves.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Not soldiers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That one hates me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander He hates the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 All the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Don't let them send us away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 -  It's not a sure thing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years and people say he's a good man.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He's running against Ser Alliser Sam, don't let them send us away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I told you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Wherever you go, I go, too.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You can't leave.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They'll execute you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Good, good, pivot.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Don't forget to pivot.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Yah! Shield up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The king wants a word.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're not cold, my lady? Never.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Feel.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Are you a virgin? No.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Good.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The bastard of Winterfell.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You know who rules at Winterfell now? Roose Bolton.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger in Robb Stark's heart.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Don't you want to avenge him? I want a great many things, Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I've been talking to your sworn brothers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Many of them love you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - They're good men.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Many don't.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Why? It's where she belonged.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They were born on the wrong side of the Wall.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That doesn't make them monsters.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No matter.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Tywin Lannister is dead.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He can't protect them now.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But if I'm to take Winterfell, I need more men.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm talking about the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your Grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army? If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We'll take Winterfell.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'll give them land to live on.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 It's a fair offer.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 More than fair.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't think that's likely.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You admire him, don't you? - I respect him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - He likes you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Convince him to bend the knee - Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 or he burns.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 How much time do I have? Nightfall.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The sun drops fast this time of year.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Hurry, Jon Snow.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Shield up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Attack, my lord! Attack! Don't cross your feet.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My sons had swords in their hands from the time they could walk.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 This one Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Great warrior? He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My lord.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Sword up, my lord! Some boys develop more slowly.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He's still young.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He's 13.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Boys go to war at 13.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - He has other gifts.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Does he? The gift of a great name.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Sometimes that's all one needs.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I have no doubt that on my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He'll be safe here.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 As for his skills, I make no promises.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We're a few days' ride from the Kingsroad.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - But that will take us - Us? The only reason you're here is because Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No one knows what you look like.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No one cares.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're safe.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - But I'm your squire.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Do you even know what a squire is? An attendant to a knight.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm not a knight.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That means you're not a squire.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Well, where would I go? I don't care.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm not your mother.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You swore to find the Stark girls.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I found Arya.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 She didn't want my protection.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 -  Sansa still might.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for your advice.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't want anyone following me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm not a leader.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I did.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - But we're heading west.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - We are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Lord Royce might be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls? No, do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us? No.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But I pay them well and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone? To a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your father was a A force to be reckoned with.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 He truly was.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such, but But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What a what a force to be reckoned with.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Thank you so much for your kind words.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Deepest condolences, Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 This tragedy I never trusted Varys.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I often warned Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Cousin Lancel.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I hardly recognized you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My deepest sympathies.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I apologize for my son's appearance.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Uncle, it's quite all right.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They call themselves sparrows.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Bloody fanatics.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm sure he'll grow out of it, whatever it is.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Excuse me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Of course.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What can I do for you? You can forgive me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness? I led you into the darkness.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I tempted you into our unnatural relations.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And, of course, there was the king his boar hunt.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 His wine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't know what you're talking about.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm a different person now.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I've found peace in the light of the Seven.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You can, too.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy or justice.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Their world is at hand.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I will pray for your father's soul.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help - It looks like Dorne.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - It doesn't.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 It does.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That's the That's the Sunspear bit right there.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And that's where the mountains are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And over here is Is Sunsnake? Stonespear? Sandstone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Yes.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Yes, Sandstone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Just there.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Fine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 It's Dorne.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We should go there.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I think we would have a lovely time, judging by my experience.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That would be wonderful.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Dorne, Highgarden.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Anywhere but here.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We're late for dinner as it is.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're very respectful.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm very hungry.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What's your name? Olyvar, my lady.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My lady.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet? Why? They all know about me anyway.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Everybody knows everything about everyone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this? In any event, you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 My intended? Please.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Tywin's dead.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Lucky you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 - Unlucky you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You think I want that woman married to my brother? If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Which means she stays in King's Landing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Perhaps.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Perhaps? Perhaps.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Eunuch, the Spider, the Master of Whisperers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Imp, Half-man.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 There are faster ways to kill yourself.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Not for a coward.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You never told me why you set me free.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Your brother asked me to.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Could have said no.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Not as dangerous as releasing me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You risked your life, your position, everything.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Why? You're not family.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You owe me nothing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I didn't do it for you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't believe in saviors.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're going to have to find another soldier.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But earning it for yourself, that takes work.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm not well-suited for work.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I think you are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You have your father's instincts for politics.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And you have compassion.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Compassion? Yes.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I killed my lover with my bare hands.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I shot my own father with a crossbow.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I never said you were perfect.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What is it you want exactly? Peace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Prosperity.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The powerful have always preyed on the powerless.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That's how they became powerful in the first place.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Perhaps.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And perhaps we've grown so used to horror, we assume there's no other way.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land? I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No, you won't.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Good luck finding him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Who said anything about "him"? You have a choice, my friend.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You can stay here at Illyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Meereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen? When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freed men and the former slaveholders.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Good.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They did ask for some concessions.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Concessions? Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm not a politician.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm a queen.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Forgive me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're right, of course.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Slavery made them rich.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I ended slavery.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They do not ask for the return of slavery.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They ask for the reopening of the fighting pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death? In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The pit fighters you liberated plead for this opportunity.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Bring some here and ask them yourself.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No fighting pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If you - How many times must I say no before you understand? Whatever he wants from me, he's not going to get it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits You should reopen the fighting pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 What? My mother was a whore.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I told you that.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 She liked to drink pear brandy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'm sorry.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Why? I was a bad child.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I wasn't big, but I was quick.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And I loved to fight.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I had my first match when I was 16.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits? I'm only here because of those pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Soon I was famous.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 screamed my name when I stepped into the pit.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I made so much money for my master, he set me free when he died.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I joined the Second Sons.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And then I met you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're the queen.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Everyone but me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You've made thousands of enemies all across the world.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Show your strength here, now.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're not the Mother of Unsullied.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're the Mother of Dragons.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I can't control them anymore.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Viserion? Rhaegal? Easy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Easy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Easy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 So here we are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Here we are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 When we first met, you were my prisoner.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And now, for our last meeting This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No, but it will be.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You know what Stannis wants? He wants me to bend the knee.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And he wants the free folk to fight for him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'll give him this much, he's bold.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Shouldn't a king be bold? Oh, aye.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I respect him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But I'll never serve him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You told me you weren't here to conquer.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You told me your people have bled enough.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 That's right.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You spent your life convincing for the first time in history.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 A life's work uniting them.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You didn't do it for power.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You didn't do it for glory.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the Wall.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Isn't their survival more important than your pride? Pride? Fuck my pride.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 This isn't about that.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Then bend the knee and save your people.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 They followed me because they respected me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Because they believed in me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The moment I kneel for a southern king, that's all gone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Oh, I am afraid.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 No shame in that.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging? They'll burn you alive.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Bad way to go.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I'll be honest with you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I don't want to die.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that, scorched and screaming.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But it's better than betraying everything I believe.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing and they'll sing songs about you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You'd rather burn than kneel.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The great hero.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and there's no one left to sing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 You're a good lad.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Truly you are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I think you're making a terrible mistake.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Mance Rayder, you've been called the King-beyond-the-Wall.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Westeros only has one king.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Kneel and live.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 This was my home for many years.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We all must choose.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We choose light or we choose darkness.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We choose good or we choose evil.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 We choose the true god or the false.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Free folk, there is only one true king and his name is Stannis.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Here stands your king of lies.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	 Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	In old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the Titan would step with fire in its eyes, wade into the sea and smash the enemies.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It's just a statue.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Haha.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Don't be afraid.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He's announcing our arrival.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm not afraid.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The House of Black and White.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 This is where you'll find the man you seek.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Here, I leave you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Thank you for bringing me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Any man in Braavos would have done the same.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Valar morghulis.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Valar dohaeris.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Hello.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Valar morghulis.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - No one here by that name.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Please! I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I have nowhere else to go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - You have everywhere else to go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - But wait! CerseiWalder Frey The MountainMeryn Trant.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 CerseiWalder Frey The MountainMeryn Trant.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Cersei Walder Frey The Mountain Meryn Trant.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Cersei Walder Frey The Mountain Meryn Trant.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Cersei Walder Frey The Mountain Meryn Trant Must be good food if it's crowded.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Ale? Ale? Before we left, a maester gave you a raven's scroll.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You are becoming an observant young lady.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My mother used to say "dark wings dark words".
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 An old saying.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Inaccurate in this case.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 So it's good news.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My marriage proposal has been accepted.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I thought you still mourned the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Ale? - I'll have some.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My Lady - What is it? - Sansa Stark.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Don't look! You sure? She's dyed her hair, but it's her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Littlefinger? A bunch of knights with them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Bunch? BunchSix? Twenty? Ten, I think.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Too many.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My Lady, I don't think this is Ready the horses! We only have one horse.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Find more! Do you like the taste? Don't see what all the fuss is about.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Why do men love it so much? It gives some men courage.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Does it give you courage? That's far enough.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lord Baelish.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lady Sansa.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My name is Brienne of Tarth.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We've met, with Renly Baratheon.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What did he say about you? He said, Your loyalty came free of charge.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lady Sansa.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I gave my word I will find you and protect you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I will shield your back and keep your counsel, and give my life for you if needs be.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Please, Lady Brienne.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 No need for such formality.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - I was.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Strange.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I knew Cat since the time we were children.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She never mentioned you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It was after Renly's murder.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Ah, yes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You were accused of killing him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I tried to save him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - But you were accused.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - By men who did not see what happened.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And what did happen? He was murdered by a shadow.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly, she failed.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She swore to protect your mother, she failed.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa? Why should you have any say in her affairs? Because I am her uncle.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We're family now.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And you are an outsider.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Forgive me, Lady Brienne.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But experience has made me wary of outsiders.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lady Sansa - if we can have a word alone - No.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Please, my Lady, if I can explain - I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Neither of us wanted to be there.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Sometimes we don't have a choice.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - And sometimes we do.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You should leave.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The roads in these parts aren't safe.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Why don't you stay? I'm gonna ask you to stay.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Stop! Stop! After him! Podrick! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! That's a good boy.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Come on.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Come on! No, no, no, stop! Guess that means you're unarmed.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Don't! Put that down! Podrick? Yes, my Lady? You can stand now.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Yes, my Lady.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Sansa Stark? Wary of strangers, as she should be.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I saw her riding on the Eastroad with Littlefinger.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - We'll follow them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - My Lady if both Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I swore to their mother I would protect those girls.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They don't want your protection.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You think she's safe with Littlefinger? No, my Lady.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Get your horse.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A summons from the Queen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 There are only two like it in the world.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The one I'm wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It's a threat.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Of course it's a threat.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It's a threat, No note? They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And every other tragedy that has befallen their accursed country.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Softer.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What? Not so loud.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Our daughter is in danger and you're worried I am speaking too loudly? No one can know she's our daughter.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Then don't call her your daughter.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You've never been a father to her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 If I was a father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding, our only daughter shipped off to Dorne, our baby boy set to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden! I'm gonna make things better.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You've never made anything better.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm going to Dorne.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And I'm bringing our daughter home.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She's promised to his son.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm not going to ask him anything.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You go down there with an army it's an act of war.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 No army.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Do you know where they're keeping her? Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'll find her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Is there anything else, Your Grace? You're going to Dorne.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A one-handed man.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Alone.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Who said I was going alone? No sunflowers.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I don't like yellow.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Roses are very nice, definitely roses.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And music.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I adore music.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But no flutes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I hate flutes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We can have a harp, if you like, but no flutes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Then there's the food.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're gonna need pigeon pies.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That's what they eat in the capital, don't they? Don't they? Don't who? People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They certainly do, my dear.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They certainly do.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You won't.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Pardon? We won't get to live at Stokeworth.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 When mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She hates me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when mother's not looking.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You know what I think? I think you're a good person.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And your sister is a mean person.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She is.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I've been all over the world and if there's one thing I've learned, is that meanness comes around.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 People like your sister, they always get what's coming for them, eventually.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 One way or another.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Who's that? Jaime fucking Lannister.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Ser Jaime? Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I was very sorry to hear about your father.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Thank you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 This is my betrothed, Lollys.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A pleasure.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Run along, love.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Beautiful young bride you've chosen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 When are you planning on getting married? Just get on with it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 On with what? What you're here for.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It's very good for you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Mmm.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We've made a deal, your sister and I.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I would have advised against that.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 How is this good for me? Because you're going to come with me and help me with something important.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And when we return I'm gonna give you a much better girl and a much better castle.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Return from where? As far south as south goes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You are my queen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Remove yourself from my path or I'll take that long axe and I'll shove it up your Captain let her pass.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your brother was murdered and you sit here in the Water Gardens staring at the sky and doing nothing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by law, that is no murder.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Your brother - You don't have to remind me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What will you know about his death? I will bury him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I will mourn for him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And then? You would have me go to war.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The whole country would have you go to war.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The Sand Snakes are with me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They have the love of their people.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They will avenge their father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Oberyn is dead.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill? Let me have her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I loved my brother.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And you made him very happy.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 For that, you will always have a place in my heart.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Not here.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Not while I rule.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And how long would that be? The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 'Course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You haven't, have you? My Second Sons on the other hand they drink, they whore, fight in streets, they blend in.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They overhear things in taverns.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Break a few fingers, overhear a few more things before you know it No one here.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 In a hurry? You're afraid? Unsullied fear nothing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Right.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That's your problem.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You understood fear once, long ago, but you forgot what it means.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Fear is useful that way.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Sons of the Harpy they want to put a collar back on my neck.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 On all of our necks.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Please, Your Grace - you must kill him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - It would send a message.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I think you should exercise restraint - Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Why? Well, for one thing, he may have valuable information.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Well, the Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 How do you know that? Because I questioned him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And the information you did get he is young and.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He is born free.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him? Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They pay him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Great families, afraid to do a thing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They pay poor men to do it for them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And how do you know this? - Everyone know this.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - I don't know it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And I'm the head of a great family.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We do not know what this man did or didn't do.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Give him a trial at least.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A fair trial.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Show all the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Teach them a better way.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I do not know the place from where old ser comes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Things maybe are different there, I hope.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn they own us.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 So we learn much about them or we do not live long.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They teach me what they are.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Mercy, fair trial these mean nothing to them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 All they understand is blood.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Thank you all for your counsel.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your Grace a word, please, I beg you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 About what? About your father.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - About the Mad King.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your Grace I served in his Kingsguard.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I was at his side from the first.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your enemies did not lie.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Go on.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 When the people rose in revolt against him your father set their towns and castles aflame.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He murdered sons in front of their fathers.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He burned men alive with wildfire and laughed as they screamed, and his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm not my father.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 No, Your Grace, thank the gods.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And each time, it made him feel powerful and right until the very end.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 There's a bug.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Yes, best be careful.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You might accidentally consume some solid food.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box? - You don't like it? - I want to take a walk.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You can't.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She ought to offer her cunt.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Best part of her for the best part of me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You're right, there's no point.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The road to Volantis? You said we are going to Meereen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What's in Volantis? The road to Meereen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen? I told you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A ruler.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But you've already got a ruler.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Everywhere has already got a ruler.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You are quite good, do you know? At ruling.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 During your brief tenure as Hand.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I didn't rule, I was a servant.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Still, a man of talent.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Managed to kill a lot of people? Yes, but you showed great promise in other areas as well.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She wanted me to leave King's Landing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She begged me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I wouldn't go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Why? 'Cause I liked it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Power even as a servant.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 People follow leaders and they will never follow us.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They find us repulsive.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I find us repulsive.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And yet no matter what we do people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Not for long.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You're right.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Let's go for a walk.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - No.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all? Not him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You're trying to deceive your queen? Should I throw them in a cell, Your Grace? It won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Mistakes will be made.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Thank you, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Thanks.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Thank you, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Thank you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Take the head.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Let me, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I would take it if you don't mind.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It could prove useful for my work.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Very good.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Over there would be fine.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You heard the man, over there.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You're the hand of the King.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 No, uncle.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Clearly, it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand - until he becomes full - You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine we'll have the time.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 In addition to be Master of Ships, the King has appointed you Master of Coin.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Oh, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He said he would be honored to have you represent the Crown's interest in the same.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The honor is all mine, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Y-Y-Your Grace, in the past, on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The King's named Qyburn the new Master of Whispers.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your Grace, this-this man? Th-This embarassment to the Citadel? Your Grace what qualifications can he possibly have for this post? The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That's far more than the eunuch ever had.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Far more than many ever have.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I must say I can not Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as Commander of the Lannister Armies, it would please the King if you would serve as his Master of War.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 No man living better deserves the title.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That is kind of you to say.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I would like to hear it from the King himself.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Well, the King is very busy at this moment.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He should be here, learning what it means to rule.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He is learning.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother, and to you, and to serve the King.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 To watch you stack the Small Council with sycophants.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Sending your own brother away My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What mission? That is not your concern as Master of War.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You are the Queen Mother.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Nothing more.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You would abandon your king in his time of need? If he wants to send for me, I'll be waiting for him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 At Casterly Rock.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Come on, you know this one.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It looks like an animal.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Snake.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 S-S-Sn "S".
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - It's an "S".
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Right, very good.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Hmm, did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10? I know "S".
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You'll learn, I promise.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I taught Ser Davos.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Old people are terrible at learning new things.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Well, you are a wonderful teacher.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Very patient.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I only said that the more time that you spend practicing the faster you will be able to read.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That's all right.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We're doing just fine.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 How old were you when you learned how to read? - 3.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - 3? Were you taught by your mother? No.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Our Maester Cressen did.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I had a lot of time to practice.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My mother kept me inside because What do you call it in the south? What happened to your face.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Grayscale.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What would you call it in the north of the Wall? I don't know.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But two of my sisters had it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They both died.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 How did they cure you? I don't remember.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I was a baby.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A lot of people came and tried, I think.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Whatever they did, it went away.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What happened to your sisters? My father made them move out to the keep, outside.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 None of us were allowed to go near them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But we heard them, especially at night.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They started to sound not like themselves.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Did you ever see them? Only once, at the end.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They were covered with it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Their faces, their arms, they acted like animals.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What did he do with them in the woods? Mother.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Leave us.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You need to stay away from that girl.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Why? - She's a wildling.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Her name's Gilly.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She's nice.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm teaching her to read.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 She's a wildling.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your father defeated her people.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He executed their king for treason.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They could strike at him by striking at you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Gilly wouldn't do that.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You have no idea what people will do.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 All your books and you still don't know.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You prevented that order from being carried out.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The King's word is law.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Show too much kindness, people won't fear you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 If they don't fear you, they don't follow you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 With respect, Your Grace, the Free Folk will never follow you no matter what you do.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You're the man who burned their king alive.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Who then? You? No.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Only one of their own.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Do you know this wretched girl? - Lyanna Mormont.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Lord Commander's niece.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lady of Bear Island.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And a child of ten.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I asked her to commit her house to my court.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That's her response.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That amuses you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I apologize, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Northerners commit a bit like the Free Folk.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Loyal to their own.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I know.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Even with your father's help.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Most likely.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - One pleasant man.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He thinks you're a traitor.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What's your life gonna be like here at the Wall, - with Thorne in command? - Unpleasant, I expect.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Your bravery made him look weak.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He'll punish you for it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I don't punish men for bravery.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I reward them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I don't doubt that, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But I am a brother of the Night's Watch.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I have pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I don't know what I have left to give you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You can give me the North.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I can't.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A Snow.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Kneel before me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lay your sword at my feet.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He'll make you a Stark with a stroke of a pen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I daydreamed that my father would ask the king.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 No, you deserve that.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You do.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I-I couldn't be happier for you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I'm gonna refuse him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would that be? Hey.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Crowded, You'd think we were serving venison stew.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He was Acting Commander when the Wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Yes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Nice.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - He's the only true choice.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Yes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Yes.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other Ranger.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - That's right.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 - Through ten winters he served.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 As Commander of the Shadow Tower he kept the wildlings away.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We could do no better.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 If there's no one else we will begin the voting.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Maester Aemon Samwell Tarly, go on.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Sam the Slayer.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Another wildling lover, just like his friend, Jon Snow.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 How's your lady love, Slayer? Her name is Gilly.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Ser Slynt knows her quite well.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Lies! A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 I found him there after the battle was over.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 In a puddle of his own making.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children Jon Snow was leading.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true, but when he was wounded, it was Jon who saved us.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He took charge of the Wall's defense, he killed the Magnar of the Thenns, he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Knowing it would almost certainly mean his own death.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He saw something in Jon.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And now we've all seen it too.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Yeah! Aye.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Can't argue with any of that.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 But who does Jon Snow want to command? The Night's Watch? Or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall out of his misery.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them? It is time! Appears to be a tie, maester.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! You! You! What have you got there? - I said - Turn around and go! Turn around - and go! - That's a nice little sword.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Quickly, go! Go! Who are you? Why were they scared of you? You lost this.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 There isn't.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Who are you then? No one.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 And that is who a girl must become.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 _ _ _ Why? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! She should have cut the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and be done with it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 That's what I keep telling her to do to you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Mhysa! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mhysa! Mhysa! L'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 We all guard tonight.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Leave me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	 Drogon! Shh
s05e03	High Sparrow	Valar morghulis.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Valar dohaeris.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I've been sweeping this floor for days.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Good.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I didn't come here to sweep floors.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 No? Why come, then? You said I could be your apprentice.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You said you'd teach me how to be a Faceless Man.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A man teaches a girl.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Valar dohaeris.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 All men must serve.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Faceless Men most of all.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I want to serve.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A girl wants to serve herself.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Here we serve the Many-Faced God.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 To serve well, a girl must become no one.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Which one's the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I see the Drowned God.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I see the weirwood face.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 There is only one god.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A girl knows his name.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And all men know his gift.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Where are they taking him? Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! -  I am his and he is mine.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 -  I am hers and she is mine.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 From this day until the end of my days.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Did I hurt you? No.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You were lovely.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - It all happened so fast.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Yes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I was scared maybe I hurt you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - It sounded like-- - No, no, no.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're very sweet.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The sweetest king who ever lived.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 This is all I want to do all day, every day, for the rest of my life.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Wouldn't that be glorious? Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath? There's no rush, is there? Of course not.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Are you hungry? Should I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice? No, I'm fine.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I just want you all to myself.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen, First of His Name.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 King Tommen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Still sounds strange to me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you? So strange.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Husband.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Wife.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sometimes it feels odd.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, and it's all because my brother died.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I understand.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But it's not your fault.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I don't feel guilty.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That's what's odd.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Do you like to sail? I love to sail.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I do, too.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I do, too.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Living in a tower so high it touches the clouds.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Of course, my grandmother couldn't wait to go home.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The capital's not for everyone, I suppose.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Does your mother like it here? I don't think so.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It's so wonderful to have her watching over you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A lioness guarding her cub.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Well, but I'm a man now.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You are.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And the king.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But you'll always be her baby boy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - I suppose.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 -  I adore her.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 She's always been so generous with me, so kind.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And the horrors she's had to endure-- losing her husband, her eldest child, and her father.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It's no wonder she's so protective of you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 She'll never let you out of her sight.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You look very much in love.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The first days of marriage are often so blissful.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 She smiles quite a lot.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Not that it matters.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Do you ever miss Casterly Rock? There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That's where you grew up.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You always told me that you liked the people there better.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock? The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it, that you-- that it was your real home.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 This is my real home now, where my family lives.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I want you to be happy, Mother.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I know that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I know you do.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 My sweet boy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock? I said, "Darling, surely four times is enough.
s05e03	High Sparrow	" "Are you trying to set a new record?" He said, "Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	" Mother.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Welcome.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Don't you look lovely? Marriage agrees with you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It's a bit early in the day for us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 No, no, I can't stay.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I just wanted to let you know if there's ever anything I can do for you You are very sweet.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I absolutely adore him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You raised a gallant young man.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm forever grateful.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Good.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Good.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm glad to hear you're happy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Ecstatic.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I really am.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Exhausted, to be honest.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But what could I expect? He is half lion, half stag.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'll leave you to it, then.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Oh, forgive me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I haven't been at court for long.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I get so confused.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen? There's no need for such formalities.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 In any event, judging from the king's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Won't that be a lovely day? Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Remember anything you need.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We can't hold the North with terror alone.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark and he'd be damned if he'd kiss a traitor's boot.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He left you no choice.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I flayed him living along with his wife and brother.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Made his son watch.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And? The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I've something important to tell you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Stop eating and listen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other houses rise up against us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Do you understand that? Our pact with the Lannisters protects-- I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And Tywin Lannister is dead.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 If you think they will for us, you're a fool.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We've become a great house by entering into alliances with other houses and parlaying those alliances into greater power.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The best way is marriage.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's high time you married a suitable bride.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And as it happens, I've found the perfect girl to solidify our hold on the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That's Moat Cailin.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before? On our way down to King's Landing with my father and Arya.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Where are you taking me? Home.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The Boltons have Winterfell.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 No.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He betrayed my family.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He did.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He serves the Lannisters.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 For now.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - I won't go.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Winterfell is your home.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Not anymore.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Always.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're a Stark.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Dying your hair doesn't change that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Your place is in the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I can't marry him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You can't make me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He is a traitor.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A murderer! You're not marrying Roose Bolton.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 No, you'll be marrying his son and heir Ramsay.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 One day he'll be Warden of the North and you-- - No.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Sansa.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 No, you can't make me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I will starve myself.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I will die before I have to go there.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I won't force you to do anything.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses around, but listen to me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Listen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You've been running all your life.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Terrible things happen to your family and you weep.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Stop being a bystander.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Do you hear me? Stop running.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 There's no justice in the world.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Not unless we make it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You loved your family.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Avenge them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Banners! How do we get through there? We don't.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We go around.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Takes us miles out of the way.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We'll lose sight of them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Doesn't matter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I know where they're going.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp? He hates that nickname.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he? I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 One night he had a bit too much to drink and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He borrowed it? He wasn't a thief.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I was drunk, too.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He gave me half the ham.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out under a wagon with the hambone still in his hand.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They hanged him that afternoon.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They tied the noose for me, too, but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne, so he pardoned me and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 As punishment for both of you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It didn't seem that way.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Yes, all your lords have been very kind to you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 All except me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sorry you had to squire for such a nasty person.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm not sorry.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're the best fighter I've ever seen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You beat the Hound.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm proud to be your squire.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 If you didn't snap at me, I wouldn't learn anything.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You want to be a knight, Pod? Yes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Starting tomorrow, we'll train with a sword twice a day.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Before we ride in the morning and after you make camp in the evening.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I suppose that's more important.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you? I was.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He was.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 How did you end up serving Renly? When I was a girl, my father held a ball.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm his only living child, so he wanted to make a good match for me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And it was wonderful.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They shoved each other and threatened to duel when they thought it was their turn to dance.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I had never been so happy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Till I saw a few of the boys snickering.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And then they all started to laugh.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They couldn't keep the game going any longer.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They were toying with me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 "Brienne the Beauty" they called me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Great joke.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A great lumbering beast.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 "Don't let them see your tears," he told me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 "They're nasty little shits and nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.
s05e03	High Sparrow	" He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Renly was the king's brother after all.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But wasn't he? Lord Tyrion said he was Yes, Pod, he liked men.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm not an idiot.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He didn't love me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He didn't want me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He danced with me because he was kind and didn't want to see me hurt.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He saved me from being a joke.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 From that day until his last day.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And I couldn't save him in return.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 One day I will avenge King Renly.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But you said a shadow murdered him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 How do you fight a shadow? A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I know it was Stannis.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I know it in my heart.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Stannis is a man, not a shadow.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And a man can be killed.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Lord Commander.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Your Grace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'd like to speak alone.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Olly is my steward now as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 One day he might command.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Very well.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Have you considered my offer? I have.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And I thank you for it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You do me great honor.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Say the word and you will be.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But I have to refuse you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 My place is here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm giving you the chance to avenge your family, to take back the castle where you grew up.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 To rule the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I wish I could fight beside you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Believe me, I do.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're as stubborn as your father.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I can imagine no higher praise.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I didn't mean it as praise.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Honor got your father killed.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But if your mind's made up, I won't try and dissuade you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black? Are you bored of us already? You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We will never forget that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 But it's a question of survival.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Winter is coming.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I know it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We march on Winterfell within the fortnight, before the snows trap us here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And the wildlings? If they'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I leave their fate to you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You could execute them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That's the safest course.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Most of the brothers, yes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 There's little love for the free folk here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're the Lord Commander.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Your decision.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You have many enemies in Castle Black.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He sees something in you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He believes in you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm sorry I disappointed him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The king is a complicated man, but he wants to do what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 As long as he's ruling them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He's the one true king.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He has a blood right to that throne.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Have you now? How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I'll bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Night gathers and now my watch begins.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 No, not that bit.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The bit at the end.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 -  I pledge my life-- - Right, that's enough.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The shield that guards the realms of men.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That's what you swore to be.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Now, I'm not a learned man, but the best way to help the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be done.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And what needs to be done? As long as the Boltons rule the North, the North will suffer.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Just one man's opinion.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What do you want? Who are you? - What? - You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned whose value you do not respect.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Who are you? No one.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Ow! Cunt! A lie.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A sad little lie.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Who are you? I told you, I'm no-- Do that again, and-- Who are you? You're about to find out.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What are you doing? We were only playing.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The Game of Faces.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - A girl is not ready.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Clearly not.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I am ready! For what? For whatever you want.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 To be a Faceless Man.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 To be no one.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What do we do with them after we wash them? Open gate! Honor guard, stand to! Hold up.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Easy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Lady Sansa.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Welcome.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Lord Bolton.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 May I introduce my son Ramsay Bolton? It's an honor to meet you, my lady.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You must want to wash.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Welcome home, Lady Stark.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The North remembers.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sam? Maester Aemon? He apologizes for not being here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He's not feeling well.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Take good care of him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Brothers.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Brian.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Seems like a good job for a ginger.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - That's him! - That's him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Ser Alliser.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You proved your valor many times over while defending the Wall from the wildling attack.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I name you First Ranger.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Hear, hear! Lord Janos.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Greyguard is a ruin.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Restore it as best you can.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 First Builder Yarwyck can spare 10 of his-- I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Keep your ruin.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 All right, all right! Enough of that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You mistake me, my lord.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That was a command, not an offer.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Pack your arms and armor, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I will not have it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Did you hear me, boy? I will not have it! Are you refusing to obey my order? You can stick your order up your bastard ass.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Take Lord Janos outside.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Olly, bring me my sword.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Get out.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Yes, very mistaken.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Disgrace! I have friends.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Important friends in the capital.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - You'll see.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Kneel! If you have any last words, my lord, now's the time.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I was wrong.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're the Lord Commander.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We all serve you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm sorry.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Not only for this, for all I've done and said.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I was wrong.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 My lord, please! Mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm afraid.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I've always been afraid.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You have served us well, my son.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Thank you, Father.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Which of the Seven will you worship today? - The Maiden.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Always the Maiden.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And the Stranger.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Two is extra, you realize? - Yes, yes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What are you doing? This establishment belongs to Lord Petyr Baelish.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You can't-- You have profaned our faith, the faith of our fathers and forefathers.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I am the High Septon of the-- You are a sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And you shall be punished.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Ah! - Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Repent! Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Shame on you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Sinner.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Your Grace, Grand Maester, Lord Tyrell, uh It doesn't matter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven, I give voice to the will of the gods and am their foremost servant in this world.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 An insult to me is an insult to the gods.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 An assault on my person is an assault on our very religion.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - You were assaulted? - I was.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 By those fanatics who call themselves sparrows.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They humiliated me, they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I am lucky to be alive.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I heard this assault began in Littlefinger's brothel.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 So you were ministering to the needs of these devout prostitutes? A man's private affairs ought to stay private.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What do you want from us, High Septon? Justice.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I ask that you protect our faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - If he goes unpunished-- - And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow? I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 These are deeply religious people.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Where can I find the High Sparrow? Seven blessings.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Just a little more.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A young man said I'd find the High Sparrow back here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Where is he? - High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Still, it's meant to.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The notion that we're all equal in the eyes of the Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Seven blessings to you, my dear.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It's only a name.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Quite an easy burden to bear.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Far easier than hers.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Why no shoes? Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We all do that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone? Everyone? Hard enough job reminding myself.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Well, I tell them no one's special and they think I'm special for telling them so.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Perhaps they're right.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? Have the gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me for that incident with the High Septon.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the gods in this world, wouldn't you say? Hypocrisy is a boil.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Lancing a boil is never pleasant.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Although they could have been more careful with the blade.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The High Septon came to speak to me today.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He doesn't want me to arrest you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He wants me to execute you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 My thoughts on the matter are in line with your own.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The High Septon's behavior was corrosive, as was his attitude.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Having a man like that reside in the sept eats away at the faith from the inside.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 So now he resides in the Red Keep dungeons instead.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 One collapses, so does the other.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We must do everything necessary to protect one another.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Your Grace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 -  Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger at the Eyrie or wherever he's slithering about.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 At once, Your Grace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 How's your work coming along? Very well.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You've made progress? More than I expected.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Still a way to go, but - Very good.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'll leave you to it, then.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediately.
s05e03	High Sparrow	" Shh.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Easy, friend.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 She really is lovely.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I hope I can make her happy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I hope so, too.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 She's suffered enough.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'll never hurt her.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You have my word.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I've heard very little about you, which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I haven't been a lord very long.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I was a bastard.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And you're not anymore.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Yes, Father.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And thank you, Lord Baelish.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm forever in your debt.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He seems pleased.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Shouldn't he be? I assure you, she's still a virgin.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Tyrion never consummated the marriage.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 By the law of the land, she is no man's wife.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Inspect her if you must.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'll leave that to the brothel keeper.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It's her name I need, not her virtue.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Then I have delivered everything I promised.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And you're prepared for the consequences when the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay? The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Tywin is dead.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 He kept his house in power through sheer will.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The queen will be enraged.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Queen Margaery adores Sansa.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 And yet she still has friends, men in important places whom she can ask for favors.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A message for you from Cersei Lannister.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A rider arrived from the Eyrie shortly before dawn.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Apparently she thinks you're still in the Vale.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 A message for me you say? Strange that the seal is broken.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 If you receive word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros, yet here you are in the North undermining them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Why gamble with your position? Every ambitious move is a gamble.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It appears that your gamble paid off.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're Warden of the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I had Tywin Lannister's backing.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Who supports me now? You? The Eyrie is mine.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'd like to borrow one of your birds.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Cersei will expect a reply.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'd like to read the reply.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Volantis is a large city.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 It's a perfectly good face.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I am losing my mind.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What am I? One more drunk dwarf.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Whoa! We have to go now.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Come on, hold it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Hold it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Are you ready? Slaves.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Yes, the Volantene masters are very organized.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Flies for dung shovelers.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Hammers for builders.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Tears for whores.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Lest they forget.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 _ _ We should keep moving.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 _ _ _ The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 This one's much better-looking.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 _ _ Stone Men.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Good luck stopping the spread of greyscale with prayer.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You'd have better luck dancing away the plague.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Shh.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 _ _ We're going to meet the savior.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You should have told me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Who doesn't want to meet the savior? Come on.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Let's find a brothel.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Build your house in a day.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 _ It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 See? We blend right in.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Just two more travelers mad with lust.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What curious hair.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 The Mother of Dragons! It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 We were just heading east to see you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I've got a dragon for you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 How much to make him spit fire? Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What makes you worth that much? - I'm magic.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - I'll bet you bloody are.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Well, she's taken.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Where are you going? I need to speak to someone with hair.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Hello.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - Hello.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - You've got no drink.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 - You've got no money.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Do I look like a man without money? Never trust looks.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? I always pay my debts.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm well known for it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You like her.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They all like her.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 They all want to fuck a queen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That's because they've never met a queen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're just saying that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You know how to spot a liar.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Why? Because you have a skeptical mind.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 All right, then.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm warning you, we're going to have to wash you first.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Come on.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm-- I'm sorry, I can't.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Of course you can.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You're shy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm not.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Have another drink.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Gladly, but this I can't do.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I hope it passes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 What will I do in my spare time? Go for a piss.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 That's a start.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 No need to worry.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I was just-- Oh, I thought you were someone else.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Show's almost over.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 I'm sure there are girls inside who'd be happy to oblige.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 You've made some kind of mistake.
s05e03	High Sparrow	 Why don't you tell me what you think you're doing and then-- I'm taking you to the queen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She was my sister.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 This is where she belongs.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Boltons have Winterfell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You loved your family.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Avenge them.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Does your mother like it here? So wonderful to have her watching over you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But you'll always be her baby boy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I want you to be happy, Mother.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock? Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet? Everybody knows everything about everyone.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Where can I find the High Sparrow? The High Septon's behavior was corrosive.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Hypocrisy is a boil.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Lancing a boil is never pleasant.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You shall be punished.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We must protect one another.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Myrcella is in Dorne, surrounded by people who hate our family.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Your brother was murdered.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Sand Snakes are with me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 They will avenge their father while you sit here, doing nothing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'm bringing our daughter home.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 A one-handed man? Alone? Who said I was going alone? Conquerors always meet with resistance.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on all of our necks.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 All they understand is blood.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Volantis is a large city.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The likelihood of you being spotted here increases tenfold.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'm taking you to the Queen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Is that Estermont? Tarth, Ser Jaime.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Sapphire Isle.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails? This ship's sailing to Oldtown.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We'll get off earlier not far from Sunspear, row ourselves to the Dornish shore in the night.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You ever been to Dorne? - No.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - I have.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Dornish are crazy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 All they want to do is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You should be happy to go back.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 It's how the two work together.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting, I'm sure.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Well, I am.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Not after we've kidnapped their princess.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We're not kidnapping their princess.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back to her family.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Your niece? I've been doing this sort of thing a long time.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - I'm good at it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - That's why you're here.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I know.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me? Or an army? Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Because I don't want to start a war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 That still doesn't explain what you're doing here.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 It has to be me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 If I'm putting something like this together, a one-handed man who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not-- It has to be me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You set your brother free, didn't you? I'll bet your sister didn't like that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Varys set him free.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Well, if you ever see the wee fucker, give him my regards.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He murdered my father.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And then I'll give him your regards.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Iron Bank has called in one-tenth of the crown's debts.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Given the expense of rebuilding the royal fleet-- How much can the crown afford? With winter coming, half what they ask, less? You're the Master of Coin.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How do we pay them? House Tyrell could front the gold and the crown would pay us back in time or I'd have words with my daughter.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You've already given us too much.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - Absolutely.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - In person.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - Me? - We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance to show these bankers our respect.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 As the king's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I would be honored, Your Grace.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The king's expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 My very own Kingsguard? - Please express my-- - Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Of course.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Of course.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The small council grows smaller and smaller.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Not small enough.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness? No.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The old High Septon would have asked the vintage.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But the truth is I don't like the taste.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Hmm.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How may I serve? All over Westeros we hear of septs being burned, Silent Sisters raped, bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the gods.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 If I explain their holy purpose to my son the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people? An army in service to the gods themselves.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And to you, of course, as the chosen representative of the Seven.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 An honor I never expected.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Or, indeed, ever wished for.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Which is why you were chosen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You and I both know how the world works.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 All sinners are equal before the gods.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 What would you say if I told you of a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 May the Father judge him justly.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 What are you doing? Help me! Help me! Yeah.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Yeah.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Get off me! Come on.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Shut up! Move! This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Cocksuckers.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Boy fucker.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You buggering filth! There's a special place in the seventh hell for your kind.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Please.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Please, I'll pay.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'll-- I'll pay all of you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Yes, you will.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Seize him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Sinner.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Get your hands off me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of gods and men.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Who do you think you are? Justice.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Why is my brother in a cell? I-I don't know.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I-I didn't order it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We both know who did.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Are you saying my mother's behind this? She's jealous you're not hers anymore.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Arresting my brother is her revenge.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Aren't you and Mother getting along? Oh, my sweet, sweet king.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Do you have any affection for me at all? Of course I do.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're my queen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'll set him free for you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Do you promise? I demand that Ser Loras be freed now.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Did I arrest him? Well, no.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But y-you armed the Faith Militant.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You gave the High Sparrow an army.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I did.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And your wife has every right to criticize.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We can't allow fanatics to arrest the queen's brother no matter his perversions.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released? I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're the king.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Halt! His Holiness is praying.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He will not be disturbed.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Give the order and we'll clear out this rabble.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You mean, kill them? Here at the sept? You'd be sending them to meet the gods that they love.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Bastard! You're an abomination! Born of sin! Filthy bastard! We'll find another way.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Abomination! My queen? There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm, and you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Are you? When? - I-I don't know.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - You don't know? He was praying just now.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I have to send word to Grandmother.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Will you come back later? I need to be with my family, Your Grace.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Of course.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You think highly of this boy? Good.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And a bastard by some tavern slut.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I should have given you a son.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Not your fault.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Whose, then? I gave you nothing but weakness.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And deformity.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 My lady.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Her father is the Lord's chosen king, and her father's blood runs through her veins.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You march on Winterfell soon? We must to beat the snows.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I hope you won't make that mistake again.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I won't.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I need you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You only need faith, my king.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And you, my lady, what do you need? To serve my Lord.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Lord Ashford.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Lady Caulfield.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Oh, Lord Smallwood.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I've never even heard of these people.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 They haven't heard of you, either.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But we need men and they have some.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How many men does this Lord Mayzen have to send us? More than Lord Wibberley.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - Not him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 -  I know, I'm sorry.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But we need men and supplies and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He murdered my brother.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Apologies, my lady.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Lord Commander.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How can I help you? Come with us when we ride south.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 None of us know the castle as well as you do.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Winterfell was your home once.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? Castle Black is my home now.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Night's Watch take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 There's only one war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Life against death.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Come, let me show you what you're fighting for.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're gonna show me some vision in the fire? Forgive me, my lady, I don't trust in visions.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 No visions.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 No magic.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Just life.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Do you feel my heart beating? There's power in you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You resist it, and that's your mistake.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Embrace it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Lord of Light made us male and female.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Two parts of a greater whole.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 In our joining, there's power.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Then we shouldn't tell him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - I can't.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - Why? I swore a vow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I loved another.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The dead don't need lovers.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Only the living.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I know.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But I still love her.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Are you lonely? Just bored.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Were you bored a lot, too? I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but-- I like it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I thought I'd be left at home.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I know Mother didn't want to bring me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Why do you say that? She told me, "I don't want to bring you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	" She shouldn't have said that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Are you ashamed of me, Father? When you were an infant, a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 His goods were junk except for one wooden doll.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He had even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 No doubt he had heard of your birth and assumed new fathers were easy targets.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How you pressed it to your cheek.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 By the time we burned the doll, it was too late.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I was told you would die.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Or worse, the greyscale would go slow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone Men before the sickness spread through the castle.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I told them all to go to hell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I called in every maester on this side of the world.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Every healer.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Every apothecary.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 They stopped the disease and saved your life.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 'Cause you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone Men.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And you are my daughter.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I thought I might find you here.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Your Aunt Lyanna.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Father never talked about her.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Sometimes I'd find him down here lighting the candles.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 They say she was beautiful.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I saw her once.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I was a boy living with your mother's family.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Lord Whent held a great tourney at Harrenhal.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Everyone was there.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon, and Lyanna.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 She was already promised to Robert.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men tilting at the lists.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for their prince.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How handsome he was.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I've never seen so many people so quiet.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Blue as frost.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt? Yes, he chose her.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And then he kidnapped her and raped her.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Come.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're dressed for riding.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I am.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Where are you going? King's Landing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 King's Landing? Cersei sent for me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You can't leave me here.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I know how hard it is to live with people you despise.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Believe me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But it won't be for long.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How do you know? Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But first he has to take Winterfell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - You don't know that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - I do.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons, he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You think he'll defeat the Boltons? He has a larger army.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He's the finest military commander in Westeros.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 A betting man would put his money on Stannis.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 As it happens, I am a betting man.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And if you're right? Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Grateful for your late father's courageous support of his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But I-- I wouldn't-- Wardeness of the North? You are the last surviving Stark.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He needs you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And what if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell? Or he does and the Boltons defeat him? Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I don't know how to do that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Of course you do.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He's already fallen for you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 His father frightens me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He should.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He's a dangerous man.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And you've learned to maneuver from the very best.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'll return before too long.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You'll be strong without me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The North will be yours.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Do you believe me? I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Breakfast.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 That would have been a shit way to die.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Aye, but your lot have to give the singers a good ending.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 No? Two knights off to rescue a princess.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Sounds like a good song to me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Sounds like all the rest.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 What about you? What shit way would you choose? In my own keep drinking my own wine watching my sons grovel for my fortune.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How disappointing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I've had an exciting life.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I want my death to be boring.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How do you want to go? In the arms of the woman I love.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 She want the same thing? Let's go.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 The captain of that ship-- what was he, Braavosi? Pentoshi.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And he's headed to Oldtown? As I said.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Why? What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne? A bag of gold.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 It was a heavy bag.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How many you count? Four.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How many do you think you can take? One if he's slow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Halt! Over the hill.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Fucked in the ass.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Hyah! Morning, lads.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Glad we found you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Who are you? Cooper.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 This is Darnell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're from King's Landing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom, whelped and whipped.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Why are you here? Our ship capsized in the night.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We managed to swim ashore.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 It was a near thing, really.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Thought the sharks would get us.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 There are no sharks in Dorne.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Could have sworn those were shark fins.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Dolphins, maybe.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Throw your swords in the sand.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Boys, there's no need for this.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Just point us in the right direction, we'll find our way home.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Swords in the sand now.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Hyah! Hyah! That one should be slow enough.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Nice move.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Luck.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You had a wonderful teacher.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Always wanted a Dornish stallion.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Beasts can run a day and night without tiring.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our faces.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 First we need to bury these bodies.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Birds have to eat, too.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Corpses raise questions.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Questions raise armies.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We're not here to start a war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Do you know how long it'll take us to dig all those holes? I can't dig very well with one hand.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Not at all, really.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Mama.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Nym, Obara.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Will it be war? Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Without Doran, we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We don't need an army to start a war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Queen Cersei loves her children.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And we have one of them.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You may have a problem.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 A ship's captain who found me in Planky Town claiming he had information to sell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He's come for Myrcella.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You must choose.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Doran's way and peace, or my way and war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'm with you always.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Nym? Obara? When I was a child, Oberyn came to take me to court.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I had never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 My mother wept, said I was too young and a girl.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, "Girl or boy, we fight our battles, but the gods let us choose our weapons.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	" My father pointed to the spear and then to my mother's tears.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I made my choice long ago.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Will you untie me? Will you please untie me? Will you please? Thank you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Who are you? Your captor.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Do you have wine? No.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Can't sleep without wine.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Then stay awake.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're going the wrong way.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 My sister is in Westeros.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Westeros is west.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 We're heading east.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I'm not taking you to your sister.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You said you were taking me to the queen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I am.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 She's the queen I serve.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 What a waste of a good kidnapping.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 It so happens I was heading there myself.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 What business would you have with the queen? Gold and glory.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Oh, and hate.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 If you'd ever met my sister, you'd understand.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 So, now that it's clear we are on the same side A highborn knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You're Jorah Mormont.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I have to ask.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away? Is it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, but it's all coming back.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You passed notes to Varys's little birds.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 She found out, didn't she? Found out and exiled you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Now you hope to win back her favor with a gift.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Risky scheme.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 One might even say desperate.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 You think Daenerys will execute me and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Everyone looks happy enough from up here.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 What? I was thinking about all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep into the streets of King's Landing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - Why? - He liked to walk among the people.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He liked to sing to them.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He sang to them? Yes.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Just like all the other minstrels.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And what did you do? I made sure no one killed him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And I collected the money.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 What? He liked to see how much he could make.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - He was good? - He was very good.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Viserys never told you? He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Rhaegar never liked killing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 He loved singing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 And what did you do with the money? Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 One time, we got horribly drunk.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Your Grace.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Hizdahr is here, waiting in the audience chamber.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 How many others are there? Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan? I think I can protect you from Hizdahr zo Loraq.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I think I can protect me from Hizdahr zo Loraq.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Go, Ser Barristan.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Sing a song for me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Your Grace.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 All men must die, but not all can die in glory.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 - Glory? - Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings, but their names will live on.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 It's the best chance they'll ever have.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport? Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I do not recognize this tradition.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	 _
s05e05	Kill the Boy	When I have refused the throne, Aerys reigned, whom they called the Mad King.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're Aemon Targaryen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - What happened to your face? - Greyscale.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria, to live out your short life with the Stonemen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Two of my sisters had it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They were covered with it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The acted like animals.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Hide! Hide! Put him in chains.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You want me alive so you can torture me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Sansa Stark? I saw her riding on the East Road with Littlefinger.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We'll follow them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - My Lady.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Welcome home, Lady Stark.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The North remembers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You let a halfwit escape through the crypt.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And Rickon too, the little one.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I told you what would happen if you serve me loyally.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And what would happen if you did not.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Who are you? - Your captor.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You said you're taking me to the queen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I meant Daenerys Targaryen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're the Mother of Dragons.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Show your strength.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 For all I know, he's flown half way across the world.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The Wise Masters ask for the reopening of the fighting pits.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Where slaves fought slaves to the death? Opening them would show the people of Meereen that you respect their traditions.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city together.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm so sorry, my queen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He was a good man.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 "Barristan the Bold" they called him.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He crossed a continent to serve me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He was a loyal friend.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I prefer your earlier suggestion.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But I'm the leader of my family.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Your Grace! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Don't want to overfeed them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Tomorrow perhaps.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 "And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	" She sounds like quite a woman.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Don't say that, Maester Aemon.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Maester Aemon.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Lord Commander.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 How are you feeling? Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I need your advice.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 There's something I want to do, something I have to do.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But it'll divide the Night's Watch.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Bitterly.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Do it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But you don't know what it is.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 That doesn't matter.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You do.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You will find little joy in your command.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Kill the boy, Jon Snow.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Winter is almost upon us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Kill the boy and let the man be born.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Where are the rest of the free folk now? Where have they gone? Who leads them? They followed Mance.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They won't follow anyone else.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What about you? Hard to lead when you're in chains.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What if I unchained you? Why would you do that? Because you are not my enemy.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And I'm not yours.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You belong to the realms of men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 All of you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And now everything is going to change? - It is.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Why now? Because now I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What would you have me do, Lord Commander? I'd have you go north of the Wall.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'll open the gates for them and let them through.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I don't want them to kneel for me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick-- what happens to them? You're condemning them to death.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Or maybe you're not proud.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Maybe you're just a coward.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Your people need a leader.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We don't have much time and they have less.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Make peace to save your people.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Most of them are at Hardhome.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You know where that is? Up on Storrold's Point.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I can give you 10 horses and nine other men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You can get there in a week.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We'll need ships.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 All right, then.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're coming with me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They need to hear it from you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They need to know the ships they are boarding wot be torched in the middle of the sea.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You come with me or I don't go.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You'd bring wildlings here through our gates? Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Let them die.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We got our own to worry about.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Less enemies for us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Fewer.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - What? - Nothing.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Look, well, there is good farmland in the Gift.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Land that no one uses now.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 A dozen abandoned villages.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Aye! We've been fighting them for thousands of years.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They've slaughtered villages.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They've slaughtered our brothers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And we've slaughtered theirs.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I will follow you anywhere, you know that.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - But they killed Grenn.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Yes.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - And they killed Pyp.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Aye.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They killed 50 of our brothers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I can't forget that.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I can't forgive it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You were at the Fist of the First Men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 If we abandon them, you know what they become.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Whatever they are now, they're better than that.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Thank you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Olly.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 If you have something you want to say to me, say it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's all right.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're just doing it to trick them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's not a trick.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They burned my village.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I know what it's like to lose the people you love.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I know this is hard for you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But winter is coming.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We know what's coming with it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We can't face it alone.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander? No.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She's far away from the Lannisters.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This is her home.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Thank you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You've lived here a long time? Aye.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Did you know Lord Eddard? I knew him and his father before him.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The Starks are gone now.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Not all of them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I know who's inside that castle.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Everyone knows.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The Boltons.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm not talking about the Boltons.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I need to get a message to her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 To Sansa Stark.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Who are you? Someone who swore to keep her safe.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Swore to who? Her mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Her mother's dead.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 That doesn't release me from an oath.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I served Lady Catelyn.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I serve her still.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Who do you serve? Come back here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Myranda.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I saw you staring at her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm going to marry her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 That will involve looking at her from time to time.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You said you'd marry me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And I meant it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 When I was a bastard named Snow.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But I'm a Bolton now.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What I want is no longer the primary consideration.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm furthering a dynasty.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Do you think she's pretty? Of course I do.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm not blind.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You think she's pretty, too.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm looking forward to our wedding night.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Perhaps I'll marry, too.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're the kennel master's daughter.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? You're mine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're not going anywhere.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Jealousy bores me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You remember what happens to people who bore me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda? Never.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Beg pardon, my lady.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I've come to refill the wash basin.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Oh, I don't need-- You still have friends in the North.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - But who-- - You're not alone.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I like your dress.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Who made it for you? I made it myself.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Really? Who-- who are you? I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 May I? Oh, wonderful.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The stitching.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Who taught you? - My mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm sorry for what happened to her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Thank you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's good that she taught you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It was a gift.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'd rather have a mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I know.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's not the same.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Still, it's good to remember.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Remember the way things were.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I almost forgot.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 There's something else to help you remember.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Down there at the end.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What is it? That would spoil the surprise.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You won't believe it when you see it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Theon? You shouldn't be here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You smell particularly ripe this evening.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Pour me some wine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Do you have something to tell me? No, my lord.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Reek.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She saw me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Who? Sansa.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Lady Sansa.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She came to the kennels.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She saw you? Yes.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm sorry, master.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Forgive me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I didn't think-- Come here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Get on your knees.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Give me your hand.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I forgive you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Yes, thank you, my lord.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Allow me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Thank you, Ramsay.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 My lady, we are all a family, we northerners.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Our blood ties go back thousands of years.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 So I'd like to drink to our wedding.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 To your wedding.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 To your wedding.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This isn't a strange place.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This is my home.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's the people who are strange.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're right.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Very strange.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 More wine, please.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I heard you two had reunited.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 A fitting place for it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Are you still angry with him after he what he did? Don't worry.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The North remembers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I punished him for it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He's not ironborn anymore.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He's a new man.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 A new person, anyway.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Aren't you, Reek? Yes, master.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 That's his new name-- Reek.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Why are you doing this? Because Reek has something to say to you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Don't you, Reek? An apology.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Apologize for murding her two brothers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm sorry.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Look at her, Reek.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - I'm sorry.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Sorry about what? For killing your brothers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 There, over and done with.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 That was getting very tense.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Whew.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Reek.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You will give away the bride.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Someone has to.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What better person? Good? Good? Yes, yes, very good.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Wonderful.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We're going to have a baby.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm very happy for you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 How can you be sure? Sure of what? That she's pregnant.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I mean how can you tell? Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 So how did you manage it? Manage what? Getting her pregnant.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Of course, but how did you find it? You disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the Stark girl.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And if it's a boy? You're worried about your position.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 My position is quite clear.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You've never asked me about your mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Why would I? She had me, she died.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And here we are.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She was a peasant girl.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Pretty in a common sort of way.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She was the miller's wife.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She fought me the whole time.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 A baby she claimed was mine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You are my son.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But he won't stay for long.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He means to take the North.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But the North is ours.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's yours and mine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Will you help me defeat him? Yes.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Is this every book there is? Every book there is? - In the world.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Well, no.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 There are thousands and thousands of books out there.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This library is rather small, actually.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Where you grew up, were there more books? My father's not the most literate man.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Where's that? The Citadel? In Oldtown.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'm sorry I don't know things.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Gilly, look at me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You know how to do a hundred things I can never do.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You can build a fire with wet wood.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You can cook.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You can stitch a wound.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I can wash the linens.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I can sweep the floor.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Well - Why does the Citadel have the biggest library? It's where they train the maesters.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Like Maester Aemon? I wanted to be one when I was young.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Far more adventure up here anyway.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I wouldn't have met you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Ah, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're Samwell Tarly? I am, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Your father is Randyll Tarly.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Only battle Robert ever lost.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Fine soldier, your father.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You don't look like a soldier.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But I'm told you killed a white walker.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I did, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 How? With a dagger made of dragonglass.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Dragonglass? What the maesters call obsidian.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I know what it is.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We have it in Dragonstone.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Why would obsidian kill a walker? I don't know.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I've seen it, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Seen what? The army of the dead.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - And when they come-- - We have to know how to fight them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's time.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Uh, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We can't wait that long.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We have the advantage-- more men, more horses, all fed and rested.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This could turn to winter at any moment.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We have to act now.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Give the order.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We march at sunrise.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 No need.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 They're coming with us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Won't they be safer-- - Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 No, they march with us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 As you wish, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt? Beg your pardon? At Winterfell.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 All the Kings in the North are buried there.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-- First things first.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It's a long march ahead.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And then we have to take the castle.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Is there going to be a battle? Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near-- That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You'll scare the child.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Yes, my queen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - I'm not scared.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 - Well, I am.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I promise.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I need those ships.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You'll get them back, I swear it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Have a safe journey, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And thank you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Mount up! Colors! No.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're still too weak.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 _ _ Ser Barristan? _ _ _ _ _ _ Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 There was no way you could have known.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This is not why.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Wounded in war, there is no shame for this.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 All men fear death.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 No, not death.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What do you think? Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You are as fit as anyone I know.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You know why I'm here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 So what do you think? I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I have seen you listen to your counselors.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And I have seen you ignore your counselors because there was a better choice.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 One that only you could see.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 My-- my queen, please do not do this.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What about "valar morghulis"? I did not want to die a coward.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Apparently I do not want to die at all.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It takes courage to admit fear.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And to admit a mistake.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I came here to tell you that I was wrong.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I was wrong and you were right.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 About tradition.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 About bringing the people of this city together.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I will reopen the fighting pits.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 To free men only.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Yes, my queen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Don't worry.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'll be fine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Nothing broken, I don't think.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The Mormont way.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Let's start over.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I apologize for before.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 My mouth sometimes runs away from me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 We are.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 No wine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I am a person who drinks.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 People who drink need to keep drinking.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Otherwise, they're not I know where we are.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're taking us through Valyria.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I am.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Have you sailed this route before? No.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough? I think you'll be plenty.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You know what they say.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The Doom still rules Valyria.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom? No.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 But pirates are.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Oh.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The Smoking Sea.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And then And then they weren't.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 And then they weren't.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 "They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned--" "The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	" I would clap.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I suppose this is it, then.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 This is what remains.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 What was that? Stone Men! Don't let them touch you! Get behind! Mormont, cut me free! Mormont! Mormont! Mormont! Tyrion? Tyrion.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Tyrion.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Tyrion.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're all right.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 You're heavier than you look.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Did any of them touch you? You? I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I suppose that's why they send them there.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Thank you for saving me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 So what now? We walk up the coast.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 With luck, we'll find a fishing village.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Maybe another boat.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Without luck? We've got a long walk ahead of us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 I'll get some wood for a fire.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	 Try to get some rest, huh? That's the best idea you've had all day.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	My son Jorah, fled Westeros.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He brought dishonor to our House.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I need to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of The Night's Watch.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And how's that going, commander Mormont? I shall have your head for this! You're taking us through Valyria.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The Doom still rules Valyria.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Stone Men! Don't let them touch you! You? The Eyrie is mine.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Cersei sent for me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I hope I can make her happy.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She's suffered enough.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'll never hurt her.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 All sinners are equal before the gods.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What would you say if I told you of a great sinner in our very midst? May the Father judge him justly.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Who do you think you are? Justice.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Your brother was murdered while you sit here and doing nothing.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The Sand Snakes are with me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Without Doran, we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Queen Cersei loves her children.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And we have one of them.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back to her family.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You ever been to Dorne? The Dornish are crazy.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Here we serve the Many-Faced God.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 To serve well, a girl must become no one.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What do we do with them after we wash them?    What are they doing with the bodies? Get back to work.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 No.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I've been here for weeks.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You will know why.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - When? - When it's time, not before.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Get back to work.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 When do I get to play the game? Game? The game.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The Game of Faces.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You tried already.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You failed.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I didn't even know I was playing.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Who are you? No one.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Get back to work.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Who are you? What are you doing here? How did you get here? I'm from Westeros just like you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Daughter of a lord just like you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Except I was an only child.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Heir to his fortune.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My mother died.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter, so she tried to kill me with poison.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I found out.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Sought help from the Faceless Men.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And my father was widowed again.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I've been serving them ever since.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Was that true or a lie? What? Did you believe every word I said? Get back to work.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Who are you? Who are you? Arya.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And where did you come from? Westeros.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My family home is Winterfell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord, Eddard Stark.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He died in battle.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A lie.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 After he was executed, I fled the capital.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Had to kill a stable boy.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Drove my sword through his back.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A lie.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I stabbed him in the gut.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I tried to find my mother and brother, but I never did.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 They were murdered by Walder Frey.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 An outlaw kidnapped me, a man called Polliver.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A man called the Hound.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Sandor Clegane.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He tried to sell me, but was wounded in a fight.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I left him in the mountains to die.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I wanted him to suffer.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I hated him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I hated him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 That's not a lie! A girl lies to me, to the Many-Faced God, to herself.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Does she truly want to be no one? Yes.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm not playing this stupid game anymore! We never stop playing.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 So, those villages we were supposed to find? We can't live on berries and roots.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I can.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You're not hungry? Of course I'm hungry.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm not your travelling companion.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We are travelling together in each other's company, therefore-- Do you ever shut up? I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate without ever saying a word.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Why? It never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis? I'm sure you visited many brothels in many cities.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I killed my father.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And he was fucking the woman I loved.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What do you know about my father? I met him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I visited the Wall.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 When I asked him about his men, he knew all their stories, every one of them.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He actually cared about the people under his command.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How do they put it in the Watch? "We shall never see his like again.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	" Oh, you didn't know.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm sorry.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I am.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How? I only know what I heard.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How? He was leading an expedition beyond the Wall.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 There was a mutiny.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He was murdered by his own men.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We better keep moving.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Valar morghulis.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Valar dohaeris.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I have nowhere else to go.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I've spent every penny I had.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She suffers every day of her life.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I just want it to end.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 It hurts.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I know.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Don't be afraid.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I used to be like you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I was sick.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I was dying.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But my father never gave up on me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He loved me more than anything in the world, just like your father loves you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 So he brought me here.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My father prayed to the Many-Faced God.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And I drank the water from his fountain.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 It healed me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I've devoted my life to him now.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You don't want to hurt anymore? Drink.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Is a girl ready? To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue? Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates? All that makes a girl who she is? Forever? No.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A girl is not ready to become no one.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But she is ready to become someone else.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Do you believe in anything? I believe in lots of things.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 In something greater than ourselves, I mean.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The gods, destiny.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Do you believe there's a plan for this world? No.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Neither did I.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I was a cynic just like you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Have you ever heard baby dragons singing? No.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 It's hard to be a cynic after that.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 No, it doesn't.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The Targaryens are famously insane.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What if she conquers the world? Then what? and prosperity? First we have to conquer the world.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We? All right, let's assume your dreams come true.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She hacks off my head and restores your position.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the Iron Throne.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Hurrah.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Long live the queen.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Then what? Then she rules.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice? - She's the rightful heir.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Why? Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king? - That's a slave ship.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Why are they anchored? They probably came ashore for-- Got a lot of fight in you, huh? Salt mines? Yeah, that or a galley slave.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He looks strong enough.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What about the dwarf? Worthless.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Cut his throat.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Wait.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Wait.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And then chop off his cock.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We'll sell it for a fortune.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He has to know it came from a dwarf.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf? It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Guess again.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I've never heard of free men fighting in the pits.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 in Meereen? You're in luck, then.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You're about to be rich.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You are looking at one of the great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Him? He's got to be 60 years old.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We can all see that.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But he is a veteran of 100 battles.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 They wrote songs about him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 That true? He won the tournament at Lannisport.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - The Kingslayer.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Jousting.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You're talking about jousting.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A fancy game for fancy lads.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The men who fight in the pits of Meereen will swallow him whole.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Liar.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 It's no lie.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 His name was Qotho.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 For my children.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Money.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Lord Baelish.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Yes? Lancel Lannister.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Brother Lancel.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We abandon our family names.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Quite a family to abandon.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The city has changed since you were here last.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and set the godless on the run.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Well done.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Should I send word that I'll be delayed? Step carefully, Lord Baelish.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You'll find there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Mine just happen to be entertaining.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Do you think it's wise, Your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden? The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Of course, and the Faith were armed on your orders.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The king's orders.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Is the king to blame for Ser Loras's perversion? House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Ser Loras was promised to me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Instead he chose the company of boys.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Most curious.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Lysa Arryn, for instance.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Thoroughly repellant woman.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Forgive me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I know you're still in mourning.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Lysa was a good woman.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A kind woman.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She was neither of those things.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We both know it.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Still, I pity her son.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I know how hard it can be to lose both your parents at such a young age.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights of the Vale  fight for their king? Young Lord Robin heeds my advice.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Good.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 If there's nothing else.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 There is another matter, Your Grace.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 To my shame, I failed you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But I have found Sansa Stark.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Alive and well and home again living at Winterfell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 That's not possible.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My sources are well placed.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Indeed, his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We were fools to trust a turncloak.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on their bloody Sigil.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I would counsel patience, Your Grace.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Patience? Sansa helped murder my son.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Roose Bolton is a traitor.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Let Stannis and Roose battle.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And when they're done, seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from her The weather has already begun to turn.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 That is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Ser Jaime, then.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Jaime's away on a sensitive diplomatic mission.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I have no idea when he'll be back.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Perhaps I can help.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Forgive me, Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a moneylender and a brothel keeper, not a military man.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the royal treasury.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What do you have to lose? A brothel keeper? And if you succeed? Name me Warden of the North.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'll speak to the king this evening, have him issue a royal decree.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And I'll know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 As I said I live to serve.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm going to ask him tomorrow.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - What if he says no? - He won't.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We've waited long enough.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I want you to be my wife.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Now.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What is it? Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it? Or do you-- We can't.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Not yet.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Why not? You know why not.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Someone will see.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You are going to be my wife.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I am going to be your husband.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We're allowed to walk through the gardens together.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How many other girls have you walked through these gardens? I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 They do not go squinty and you didn't answer the question.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 a lovely couple.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A Lannister and a Martell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 They have no idea how dangerous that is.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We must protect them.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Yes, my prince.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You haven't had to use that axe of yours in a long time.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I hope you remember how.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I remember how.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 was as fair as the sun   And her kisses were warmer than spring   The Dornishman's blade   It was made of black steel   And its kiss was a terrible thing   The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed  -  In a voice that was sweet as a peach--  - All right, that's enough.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm coming to the best part.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We're trying to blend in.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 This song really is all about the ending.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 It can wait.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 There.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 That's the Water Gardens.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 the princess, then what? I like to improvise.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 That explains the golden hand.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Unbroken.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 For Oberyn.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 For Oberyn.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Well, she's made herself at home.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Myrcella.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Uncle Jaime? I-- I don't understand.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What are you doing here? Let's speak in private.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - I am Trystane Martell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Trystane is my intended.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Excellent.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Good to meet you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Why don't you let them have some time alone, son? Let's not do something stupid.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - That was something stupid.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We have to go, Myrcella, now.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - You hurt him! - He'll be fine, I promise.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But we have to-- Oh, for fuck's sake.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Take her! - You're coming with me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - I don't want to.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I wasn't asking, princess.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Ah! - Drop your weapons! I am Obara Sand.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Daughter of Oberyn Martell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I fight for Dorne.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Who do you fight for? Drop your weapons.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You fight pretty good for a little girl.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Halt! Oh, you can smell the shit from five miles away.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Well, why have we stopped? Go on.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 It's theater, nothing more.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing, there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Everyone knew about him and Renly.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Everyone knew, no one cared.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But he was the king's brother.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And Loras is the queen's brother.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 No, no, no, no.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 This is unacceptable.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Cersei's behind it.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Yeah, of course she is.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She wants to drag our name through the dirt, put us in our place.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Get some rest, dear.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You look appalling.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You must be exhausted.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Put the pen down, dear.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We both know you're not writing anything.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Ah, yes.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The famously tart-tongued Queen of Thorns.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I beg your pardon? I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 If you apologize for that comment, perhaps I'll-- You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I was as shocked as anyone when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I have no love for these fanatics, but what can a Queen Mother do? Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies? I can assure you, our alliance with House Tyrell remains-- Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison? As I said, I didn't imprison anyone.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 As for your veiled threats-- What veil? The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare? I didn't trust your father.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I didn't particularly like him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But I respected him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He was no fool.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 House Lannister has no rival.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Good day, Lady Olenna.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly? I don't pay attention to rumors.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You were said to be despondent when he died.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside even as Stannis's army closed in.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He was my friend.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He was my king.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I was wrong to support Renly's claim, I know that.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But I was forgiven by Joffrey.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Yes, wearing Renly's armor.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Why does it matter what I wore? Do you deny all the charges against you? Fornication.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Buggery.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Blasphemy.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Of course I deny them.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You never lay with Renly Baratheon? Never.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Nor any other man? Never.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 That will be all, Ser Loras.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Well, I think that's quite enough of that.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You call me forward? Yes, we have some questions for you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - I am the queen.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - You are.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And according to the law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How do you respond to these charges against your brother? They are lies.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - All of them? - All of them.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge? Yes, I swear it.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Thank you, Your Grace.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Do you know this man? Yes, very well.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How did you come to meet? I squired for him.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He took a liking to me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And what occurred in his chamber? We engaged in intimate relations.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You lay with him? That night and many others.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Liar.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He's a liar.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Is there anyone else who can support your claim? Yes.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Yes, Queen Margaery.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She walked in on us once not long ago.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She didn't seem surprised.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 This testimony is an insult to a great house.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Why should the Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden? Your Grace.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Quite high on his thigh.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Wine-colored and roughly the shape of Dorne.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 No! Liar! What are you doing? Let us pass.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 The Faith is satisfied there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What? Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any, my lady.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Take her.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 No.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Tommen.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Tommen! You can't do this.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I am the queen.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Tommen! Tommen! I am your queen.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 How dare you? Take your hands off me! Tommen! What do you want? Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you a bath, my lady.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband, don't you? You're so beautiful, but you need to keep him happy.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Ramsay gets bored easily.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You don't want to end up like-- well, like the others.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What others? I shouldn't gossip.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Oh, it's good to see the red again.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 No point hiding anymore.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 What others? Let's see, there was Kyra the blacksmith's daughter.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She was tall like you, lovely figure.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But she talked and talked and talked and Ramsay grew tired of that.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Then there was Violet.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She had gorgeous blonde hair.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But she got pregnant.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And, well, that was boring.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Then Tansy.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Such a sweet girl.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Hunt? Mmm.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 But, well, it's your wedding day.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Why am I talking about such things? What was your name again? Myranda.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 And how long have you loved him, Myranda? Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? And I came along and ruined it.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 This is my home and you can't frighten me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Are you done with your bath, my lady? Go.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I can finish on my own.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Yes? I've come to escort you to the godswood, my lady.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 If you please, my lady, will you take my arm? No.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I'm not touching you.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Please.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He'll punish me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You think I care what he does to you? Who comes before the old gods this night? Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 A woman grown, trueborn and noble.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Who comes to claim her? Ramsay of House Bolton.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Who gives her? Theon of House Greyjoy, who was-- who was her father's ward.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Lady Sansa, will you take this man? I take this man.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Are you pleased, my lady? Good.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 I want you to be happy.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 My father said you're still a virgin.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Uh, yes.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 - Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves? Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He was gentle.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 He never touched me.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You're not lying to me? No, my lord.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a bad way to start a marriage.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We're man and wife now.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 We should be honest with each other.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Don't you think? Yes.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Good.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Take off your clothes.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Oh, no, no, no.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You stay here, Reek.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You watch.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Reek I told you to watch.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 You've known Sansa since she was a girl.
s05e06	Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken	 Now watch her become a woman.
s05e07	The Gift	Did you kill Joffrey? It was something my new friends wanted very badly.
s05e07	The Gift	 You didn't think I'd let you marry that beast, did you? We engaged in intimate relations.
s05e07	The Gift	 Queen Margaery walked in on us.
s05e07	The Gift	 There is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery.
s05e07	The Gift	 Take her.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Lancel Lannister.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Brother Lancel.
s05e07	The Gift	 - We abandon our family names.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Quite a family to abandon.
s05e07	The Gift	 To forge a lasting bond with the people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family and reopen the fighting pits.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's a slave ship.
s05e07	The Gift	 Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I will prove my worth.
s05e07	The Gift	 I want you to be my wife.
s05e07	The Gift	 We have to go, Myrcella.
s05e07	The Gift	 Now.
s05e07	The Gift	 Drop your weapons.
s05e07	The Gift	 We're going to have a baby.
s05e07	The Gift	 From the way she's carrying, it looks like a boy.
s05e07	The Gift	 Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sansa is in danger, even if she doesn't realize it.
s05e07	The Gift	 If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the Broken Tower.
s05e07	The Gift	 Will you take this man? I take this man.
s05e07	The Gift	 You've known Sansa since she was a girl.
s05e07	The Gift	 Now watch her become a woman.
s05e07	The Gift	 I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it.
s05e07	The Gift	 I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.
s05e07	The Gift	 - The Queen and the Princess? - They're coming with us.
s05e07	The Gift	 We march at sunrise.
s05e07	The Gift	 And if you go north of the Wall, gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them here.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll open the gates and let them through.
s05e07	The Gift	 Make peace to save your people.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're coming with me.
s05e07	The Gift	 First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.
s05e07	The Gift	 Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all the brothers who have died fighting the wildlings.
s05e07	The Gift	 As always, thank you for your honesty.
s05e07	The Gift	 Safe travels, Lord Commander.
s05e07	The Gift	 Thank you, Sam.
s05e07	The Gift	 Oh, um It's dragonglass.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's what I used to kill the white walker.
s05e07	The Gift	 I hope you don't need them.
s05e07	The Gift	 Me, too.
s05e07	The Gift	 Yah.
s05e07	The Gift	 There he is.
s05e07	The Gift	 That laugh.
s05e07	The Gift	 Egg.
s05e07	The Gift	 Egg laughed like that.
s05e07	The Gift	 One of the first things I remember.
s05e07	The Gift	 His little brother Aegon.
s05e07	The Gift	 He became king.
s05e07	The Gift	 And before that, he was a jolly fellow, like this one.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get him south, Gillyflower.
s05e07	The Gift	 Before it's too late.
s05e07	The Gift	 Theon, wait.
s05e07	The Gift	 Not Theon, my lady.
s05e07	The Gift	 Reek.
s05e07	The Gift	 Help me.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're his wife now.
s05e07	The Gift	 Theon.
s05e07	The Gift	 Do what he says.
s05e07	The Gift	 Do what he says or he'll hurt you.
s05e07	The Gift	 He already hurts me every night.
s05e07	The Gift	 All day I'm locked in this room and every night he comes It can't be any worse.
s05e07	The Gift	 It can.
s05e07	The Gift	 It can always be worse.
s05e07	The Gift	 - What did he do to you? - Please.
s05e07	The Gift	 - You betrayed my family! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You have to help me.
s05e07	The Gift	 Theon, help me.
s05e07	The Gift	 He'll see us.
s05e07	The Gift	 You don't know him.
s05e07	The Gift	 My family still has friends in the North.
s05e07	The Gift	 All I need to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me.
s05e07	The Gift	 Climb to the top of the broken tower.
s05e07	The Gift	 Light this candle and put it in the window.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Promise me, Theon.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Reek! My name is Reek.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your name is Theon Greyjoy.
s05e07	The Gift	 Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
s05e07	The Gift	 Do you hear me? Theon promise me.
s05e07	The Gift	 Yes, Reek? Egg.
s05e07	The Gift	 Egg.
s05e07	The Gift	 Mother's looking for you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Egg.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get some sleep, Sam.
s05e07	The Gift	 You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.
s05e07	The Gift	 You don't know that.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get some sleep.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll watch over him.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'm staying, too.
s05e07	The Gift	 He's always been good to me.
s05e07	The Gift	 I can't leave him now.
s05e07	The Gift	 Egg! Egg.
s05e07	The Gift	 I dreamed that I was old.
s05e07	The Gift	 His name was Aemon Targaryen.
s05e07	The Gift	 He came to us from King's Landing.
s05e07	The Gift	 A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn, and sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful.
s05e07	The Gift	 No man was wiser or gentler or kinder.
s05e07	The Gift	 At the Wall, a dozen lord commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them.
s05e07	The Gift	 He was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out.
s05e07	The Gift	 And now his watch is ended.
s05e07	The Gift	 And now his watch is ended.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're losing all your friends, Tarly.
s05e07	The Gift	 My beautiful wife.
s05e07	The Gift	 When my father told me we were marrying, I half expected a fat, bearded beast.
s05e07	The Gift	 Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You've made me very happy.
s05e07	The Gift	 Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell.
s05e07	The Gift	 He's a respected commander.
s05e07	The Gift	 His troops are loyal and battle-tested.
s05e07	The Gift	 He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords to bolster his army.
s05e07	The Gift	 But this storm is a stroke of luck for us northerners.
s05e07	The Gift	 Our people are used to fighting in the frost.
s05e07	The Gift	 His army is out there now suffering in the snow.
s05e07	The Gift	 One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
s05e07	The Gift	 You'll be my lady and Wardeness.
s05e07	The Gift	 But isn't your stepmother pregnant? What of it? What happens if she has a boy? Then I'll have a baby brother.
s05e07	The Gift	 But he'll be the heir.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.
s05e07	The Gift	 But you're a bastard.
s05e07	The Gift	 A trueborn will always have the stronger claim.
s05e07	The Gift	 I've been naturalized by a royal decree from-- Tommen Baratheon? Another bastard.
s05e07	The Gift	 Bastards can rise high in the world.
s05e07	The Gift	 Like your half-brother Jon Snow.
s05e07	The Gift	 Born the bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e07	The Gift	 You didn't know? Yes, he's done very well for himself.
s05e07	The Gift	 Oh.
s05e07	The Gift	 I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me.
s05e07	The Gift	 Come, my lady.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your northern friend.
s05e07	The Gift	 Reek told me you wanted to leave.
s05e07	The Gift	 Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.
s05e07	The Gift	 Tough old bird.
s05e07	The Gift	 Everyone talks when I start peeling them.
s05e07	The Gift	 But this one, her heart gave out before I even got to her face.
s05e07	The Gift	 We do breed them tough in the North.
s05e07	The Gift	 Bring my wife back to her chamber.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's far too cold out here for a lady.
s05e07	The Gift	 You should hold on to your candles.
s05e07	The Gift	 The nights are so long now.
s05e07	The Gift	 40 horses died in the night.
s05e07	The Gift	 We'll lose more come sunset.
s05e07	The Gift	 We're running out of food.
s05e07	The Gift	 We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.
s05e07	The Gift	 What else? The Stormcrows rode off last night.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sellswords.
s05e07	The Gift	 Loyal to nothing but gold.
s05e07	The Gift	 We still have a hard march to Winterfell and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.
s05e07	The Gift	 And? This isn't our time.
s05e07	The Gift	 We should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.
s05e07	The Gift	 I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos.
s05e07	The Gift	 If I retreat again, I'll become the King Who Ran.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Your Grace-- - Winter is coming.
s05e07	The Gift	 Those aren't just the Stark words.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's a fact.
s05e07	The Gift	 If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black.
s05e07	The Gift	 And who can say how many years this winter will last? It's better to wait for the right time than risk everything.
s05e07	The Gift	 This is the right time and I will risk everything.
s05e07	The Gift	 Because if I don't, we've lost.
s05e07	The Gift	 We march to victory or we march to defeat.
s05e07	The Gift	 But we go forward.
s05e07	The Gift	 Only forward.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your Grace.
s05e07	The Gift	 I've trusted in your visions and your prophecies for years.
s05e07	The Gift	 You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames.
s05e07	The Gift	 A great battle in the snow.
s05e07	The Gift	 - I don't know what I saw.
s05e07	The Gift	 - You do know.
s05e07	The Gift	 Trust yourself.
s05e07	The Gift	 And you? Do you trust yourself? I trust in the Lord.
s05e07	The Gift	 Are you sure? I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Winterfell.
s05e07	The Gift	 I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground.
s05e07	The Gift	 But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory.
s05e07	The Gift	 I have shown you the power of king's blood.
s05e07	The Gift	 The usurper Robb Stark.
s05e07	The Gift	 The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
s05e07	The Gift	 We don't have Robert's bastard here.
s05e07	The Gift	 No, we have someone better.
s05e07	The Gift	 And your blood runs through her veins.
s05e07	The Gift	 Have you lost your mind? Do you doubt me? Still? After all that you've seen.
s05e07	The Gift	 There must be another way.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Leeches or-- - There is only one way.
s05e07	The Gift	 You must become king before the Long Night begins.
s05e07	The Gift	 Only you can lead the living against the dead.
s05e07	The Gift	 All your life has led us to this moment.
s05e07	The Gift	 - To this decision.
s05e07	The Gift	 - She's my daughter.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get out.
s05e07	The Gift	 There's always some sort of grub on.
s05e07	The Gift	 A bit of mutton would be nice.
s05e07	The Gift	 A beauty from beyond the Wall.
s05e07	The Gift	 Where you going, love? Aren't we better-looking than the fat man? No, the question is is she pretty down south in the real world or is she pretty 'cause she's the only girl here? Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.
s05e07	The Gift	 Come on, love, give us a kiss.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Leave me alone.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Oh, if you were my girl, I wouldn't leave you alone.
s05e07	The Gift	 - One little kiss.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Come on, give him a kiss.
s05e07	The Gift	 A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.
s05e07	The Gift	 There's no need to be rude.
s05e07	The Gift	 We just want a little affection.
s05e07	The Gift	 Ooh.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get your hands off her.
s05e07	The Gift	 Brother Derek, Brother Brant, I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sam the Slayer.
s05e07	The Gift	 You gonna slay me with that sword? Look at his hand shake.
s05e07	The Gift	 Gilly, go on.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get back to your room, lock the door.
s05e07	The Gift	 - I'm warning you.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Come on.
s05e07	The Gift	 Come on.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sam! You lying sack of shit.
s05e07	The Gift	 Killed a white walker, eh? You fat-ass fuck.
s05e07	The Gift	 Come on, get up.
s05e07	The Gift	 - No! - This your hero? This hog? Leave him alone! Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you? - Come on! - No! - Sam! Sam! Sam! - Come on! - Sam! Sam! - Come on.
s05e07	The Gift	 Right.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll deal with this.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Turn her over.
s05e07	The Gift	 - All right.
s05e07	The Gift	 I said get your hands off her.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're gonna get yourself killed.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your lover Jon Snow's not here to save you.
s05e07	The Gift	 I killed a white walker, I killed a Thenn.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll take my chances with you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sam! - I'm all right.
s05e07	The Gift	 - You're not.
s05e07	The Gift	 Just a bit woozy.
s05e07	The Gift	 The next time you see something like that, you leave it alone.
s05e07	The Gift	 I will not.
s05e07	The Gift	 They would have-- I don't know what they would have done.
s05e07	The Gift	 I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come.
s05e07	The Gift	 No.
s05e07	The Gift	 No, no.
s05e07	The Gift	 They were tiring out.
s05e07	The Gift	 I had them in the palm of my hand.
s05e07	The Gift	 Don't be stupid, Sam.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're not a fighter.
s05e07	The Gift	 What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you? Just promise me whatever happens, you'll take care of Little Sam.
s05e07	The Gift	 But of course I will.
s05e07	The Gift	 And I'll take care of you, too.
s05e07	The Gift	 I need more water.
s05e07	The Gift	 Stay.
s05e07	The Gift	 Please? Am I hurting you? Are you sure? Oh, my! A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends.
s05e07	The Gift	 Not your usual street tough or drunken pirate.
s05e07	The Gift	 This one's a Westerosi knight from an ancient house trained in sword and lance.
s05e07	The Gift	 He fought beside the stag king Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea.
s05e07	The Gift	 He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.
s05e07	The Gift	 He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat.
s05e07	The Gift	 Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts.
s05e07	The Gift	 Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.
s05e07	The Gift	 Do I have 14? Do I hear 16? Sold.
s05e07	The Gift	 Wait! You have to buy me as well.
s05e07	The Gift	 Why? We're a team.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'm a great fighter, too.
s05e07	The Gift	 He's funny.
s05e07	The Gift	 You have to give him that.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're right, he's funny.
s05e07	The Gift	 Thank you, my lord.
s05e07	The Gift	 Thank you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Yes.
s05e07	The Gift	 My lord, if I may.
s05e07	The Gift	 I've heard Meereen has become a free city.
s05e07	The Gift	 You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits.
s05e07	The Gift	 Now, if you were to fight freed men who'd be paid a wage-- There's your wages, funny man.
s05e07	The Gift	 Should last the rest of your life.
s05e07	The Gift	 These are warrior hands, not a serving girl's.
s05e07	The Gift	 How long before the King of Meereen comes to claim my pillow? Don't be ridiculous.
s05e07	The Gift	 My marriage to Hizdahr is political.
s05e07	The Gift	 I think he's smart enough to understand that.
s05e07	The Gift	 I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
s05e07	The Gift	 Are you jealous? You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition? I do.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're right.
s05e07	The Gift	 My motivations are entirely impure.
s05e07	The Gift	 Doesn't make me wrong.
s05e07	The Gift	 You told me yourself I can't fight enemies within and without.
s05e07	The Gift	 So when enemies without come knocking, I need the city of Meereen behind me.
s05e07	The Gift	 I have no choice.
s05e07	The Gift	 Everyone has a choice.
s05e07	The Gift	 Even slaves have a choice-- death or slavery.
s05e07	The Gift	 So what else can I do, hmm? Marry me instead.
s05e07	The Gift	 Even if I wanted to do such an inadvisable thing, I couldn't.
s05e07	The Gift	 Why not? You are queen.
s05e07	The Gift	 You can do what you like.
s05e07	The Gift	 No, I can't.
s05e07	The Gift	 Then you are the only person in Meereen who's not free.
s05e07	The Gift	 And I know I'm here to serve my queen and not give advice, but can I make one more suggestion? Of course.
s05e07	The Gift	 On the day of the great games, gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters and Worthy Masters you can find and slaughter them all.
s05e07	The Gift	 I am a queen, not a butcher.
s05e07	The Gift	 All rulers are either butchers or meat.
s05e07	The Gift	 You there.
s05e07	The Gift	 Where would I find the High Septon or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he's got? It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.
s05e07	The Gift	 You should have the decency to stand when you speak to a lady.
s05e07	The Gift	 You should have the decency to kneel before the gods.
s05e07	The Gift	 Don't spar with me, little fellow.
s05e07	The Gift	 For me, it's the knees.
s05e07	The Gift	 - You? - Hips.
s05e07	The Gift	 Ah.
s05e07	The Gift	 A man of the people.
s05e07	The Gift	 Is that your game? It's an old game.
s05e07	The Gift	 Dull and unconvincing.
s05e07	The Gift	 A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her.
s05e07	The Gift	 The people always do the dirty work.
s05e07	The Gift	 Spare me the homilies.
s05e07	The Gift	 I can smell a fraud from a mile away.
s05e07	The Gift	 Useful talent.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied.
s05e07	The Gift	 The Father judges us all.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.
s05e07	The Gift	 If you break his laws, you will be punished.
s05e07	The Gift	 Don't you walk away from me.
s05e07	The Gift	 You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna.
s05e07	The Gift	 What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
s05e07	The Gift	 What, then? I imagine this is strange for you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.
s05e07	The Gift	 But I'm telling you a simple truth.
s05e07	The Gift	 I serve the gods.
s05e07	The Gift	 The gods demand justice.
s05e07	The Gift	 How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse? By the holy text, "The Seven-Pointed Star.
s05e07	The Gift	" If you don't have one in your library, I'll give you my own.
s05e07	The Gift	 I've read "The Seven-Pointed Star.
s05e07	The Gift	" Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
s05e07	The Gift	 Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws.
s05e07	The Gift	 You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists, and yet you punish Loras for shagging some perfumed ponce and Margaery for defending her brother? Yes.
s05e07	The Gift	 The gods' laws must be applied to all equally.
s05e07	The Gift	 If it's equality you want, so be it.
s05e07	The Gift	 When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve.
s05e07	The Gift	 And I'll make sure the hungry know who's to blame.
s05e07	The Gift	 Have you ever sowed the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye.
s05e07	The Gift	 You are the few, we are the many.
s05e07	The Gift	 And when the many stop fearing the few Lady Olenna.
s05e07	The Gift	 Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.
s05e07	The Gift	 She's in a prison cell and there is nothing I can do.
s05e07	The Gift	 I am the king! The queen is in prison and there is nothing I can do! No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.
s05e07	The Gift	 Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had.
s05e07	The Gift	 You cannot blame yourself for fate.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your father, your brother, your grandfather-- I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world.
s05e07	The Gift	 Kissed their heads after they'd gone.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll call in the army.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll start a war if I have to.
s05e07	The Gift	 You know as well as I do who the first casualty of that war would be.
s05e07	The Gift	 I love her.
s05e07	The Gift	 I love her and I can't help her.
s05e07	The Gift	 We must be strong for those we love.
s05e07	The Gift	 We cannot give in to despair.
s05e07	The Gift	 I will speak with the High Sparrow.
s05e07	The Gift	 There must be something he-- Let me talk to him on your behalf.
s05e07	The Gift	 The king cannot sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
s05e07	The Gift	 You will try to help her? I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your happiness is all I want in this world.
s05e07	The Gift	 - I know.
s05e07	The Gift	 - No, you don't.
s05e07	The Gift	 You can't possibly.
s05e07	The Gift	 Not until you have children of your own.
s05e07	The Gift	 I would do anything for you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Anything to keep you from harm.
s05e07	The Gift	 I would burn cities to the ground.
s05e07	The Gift	 You are all that matters.
s05e07	The Gift	 You and your sister.
s05e07	The Gift	 From the moment you came into this world.
s05e07	The Gift	 My boy.
s05e07	The Gift	 My only boy.
s05e07	The Gift	 Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's well-being.
s05e07	The Gift	 You looked different when I left.
s05e07	The Gift	 You had more hair.
s05e07	The Gift	 And more hands.
s05e07	The Gift	 - How's Trystane? - He'll be all right.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'm sorry for that.
s05e07	The Gift	 It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
s05e07	The Gift	 Why is it happening at all? Your mother's worried about you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Threats have been made.
s05e07	The Gift	 Dorne's too dangerous for you.
s05e07	The Gift	 - I've come to take you home.
s05e07	The Gift	 - This is my home.
s05e07	The Gift	 This has been my home for years.
s05e07	The Gift	 I didn't want to come here, but she told me to.
s05e07	The Gift	 I did what she said.
s05e07	The Gift	 I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back? It's for your own good.
s05e07	The Gift	 These are complicated matters.
s05e07	The Gift	 No, it's not complicated at all.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's simple.
s05e07	The Gift	 I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here.
s05e07	The Gift	 - I don't understand.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Of course you don't.
s05e07	The Gift	 You don't know me.
s05e07	The Gift	  Brothers, O brothers, my days here are done   The Dornishman's taken my life   But what does it matter   For all men must die  And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife   I have, I've tasted the Dornishman's wife.
s05e07	The Gift	  He's got a good voice.
s05e07	The Gift	 We're lucky he's a singer.
s05e07	The Gift	 If he were a fighter, we might have been in trouble.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's against my code to hurt a woman.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
s05e07	The Gift	 I wouldn't say you beat me.
s05e07	The Gift	 How's your arm? Wonderful.
s05e07	The Gift	 Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
s05e07	The Gift	 You think you're leaving Dorne? No great hurry.
s05e07	The Gift	 Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
s05e07	The Gift	 Thank you.
s05e07	The Gift	 I said Dornish women.
s05e07	The Gift	 I didn't say you.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen? I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e07	The Gift	 Name one more beautiful than I am.
s05e07	The Gift	 Well, now, in King's Landing, there was an absolutely gorgeous There was a what? In King's Landing, you were saying? Was I? There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
s05e07	The Gift	 Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
s05e07	The Gift	 How's your arm now? You seem concerned with it.
s05e07	The Gift	 You must really like me.
s05e07	The Gift	 And how about your head? My head? My head? You don't even want to know what's going on in-- Your nose is bleeding.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's nothing.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's the dry air.
s05e07	The Gift	 My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshai.
s05e07	The Gift	 They call it the Long Farewell.
s05e07	The Gift	 It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.
s05e07	The Gift	 The only antidote.
s05e07	The Gift	 Who's the most beautiful woman in the world? You.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sorry? Who? You.
s05e07	The Gift	 Don't drop it.
s05e07	The Gift	 I think you're very handsome as well.
s05e07	The Gift	 - I'm sorry about the locale.
s05e07	The Gift	 - No, you're not.
s05e07	The Gift	 It felt like the safest place.
s05e07	The Gift	 Not for your clientele, clearly.
s05e07	The Gift	 It was an establishment like no other.
s05e07	The Gift	 The sheer range of appetites catered to.
s05e07	The Gift	 Desires that didn't even exist until we invented them.
s05e07	The Gift	 You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you? The past is the past.
s05e07	The Gift	 The future is all that's worth discussing.
s05e07	The Gift	 The future of House Tyrell.
s05e07	The Gift	 Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren or me.
s05e07	The Gift	 I should have known you'd return to the capital as soon as things started to go wrong.
s05e07	The Gift	 - I promise you-- - I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined.
s05e07	The Gift	 Together we murdered a king.
s05e07	The Gift	 If my house should fall, I will have nothing to hide.
s05e07	The Gift	 And if I should meet with some accident here at your broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you.
s05e07	The Gift	 So do you deny a part in all this? Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.
s05e07	The Gift	 I dared not refuse her.
s05e07	The Gift	 And what did she want? A piece of information she knew that I had.
s05e07	The Gift	 Neither silence nor lies were an option.
s05e07	The Gift	 But I have other information of which she is unaware.
s05e07	The Gift	 And as you say, our interests are aligned.
s05e07	The Gift	 I have a gift for you.
s05e07	The Gift	 What kind of gift? The same kind I gave Cersei.
s05e07	The Gift	 A handsome young man.
s05e07	The Gift	 Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the great games.
s05e07	The Gift	 When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon, it will represent a significant rise in your station.
s05e07	The Gift	 But if you do happen to triumph here, you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen.
s05e07	The Gift	 So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today.
s05e07	The Gift	 This is the day your lives actually start to mean something.
s05e07	The Gift	 You and you.
s05e07	The Gift	 You.
s05e07	The Gift	 You two.
s05e07	The Gift	 You, you, and you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Up.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Valar morghulis.
s05e07	The Gift	 - Valar dohaeris.
s05e07	The Gift	 Prepare yourselves.
s05e07	The Gift	 Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
s05e07	The Gift	 For generations in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds of the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.
s05e07	The Gift	 Move yourselves.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your Grace.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your future Grace.
s05e07	The Gift	 You honor us all.
s05e07	The Gift	 Stand there.
s05e07	The Gift	 Stand straight.
s05e07	The Gift	 That's the fucking queen.
s05e07	The Gift	 We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.
s05e07	The Gift	 We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.
s05e07	The Gift	 Fight! I think I've seen enough.
s05e07	The Gift	 Your Grace, it is a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.
s05e07	The Gift	 I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
s05e07	The Gift	 What are you doing? Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get him out of my sight.
s05e07	The Gift	 Khaleesi, please.
s05e07	The Gift	 I just need a moment of your time.
s05e07	The Gift	 I brought you a gift.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's true.
s05e07	The Gift	 He has.
s05e07	The Gift	 Who are you? I am the gift.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.
s05e07	The Gift	 My name is Tyrion Lannister.
s05e07	The Gift	 This is horrible.
s05e07	The Gift	 Unacceptable.
s05e07	The Gift	 Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this.
s05e07	The Gift	 Venison.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's quite good.
s05e07	The Gift	 I had it myself for supper only last night.
s05e07	The Gift	 We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother.
s05e07	The Gift	 Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the High Sparrow.
s05e07	The Gift	 But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.
s05e07	The Gift	 I know you did this.
s05e07	The Gift	 We are making every effort on your behalf.
s05e07	The Gift	 I swear to you by all the seven gods.
s05e07	The Gift	 Lies come easily to you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Everyone knows that.
s05e07	The Gift	 But innocence, decency, concern, you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.
s05e07	The Gift	 Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're upset.
s05e07	The Gift	 You're not thinking clearly.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
s05e07	The Gift	 I don't want to see you again.
s05e07	The Gift	 I do hope you change your mind about that.
s05e07	The Gift	 I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.
s05e07	The Gift	 Though I suppose your isolation will end when your trial begins.
s05e07	The Gift	 Leave.
s05e07	The Gift	 Yes.
s05e07	The Gift	 I'm afraid I must.
s05e07	The Gift	 My son needs me now more than ever.
s05e07	The Gift	 Get out, you hateful bitch! Sleep well, sister.
s05e07	The Gift	 Thank you, Boake.
s05e07	The Gift	 - You saw her? - Yes.
s05e07	The Gift	 - And? - Her accommodations seem sufficient.
s05e07	The Gift	 What happens to her now? Well, she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion.
s05e07	The Gift	 A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they're guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith.
s05e07	The Gift	 Who will stand judge? Seven septons as it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
s05e07	The Gift	 Will you be one of them? I will.
s05e07	The Gift	 If one or both of them were to confess before the trial Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.
s05e07	The Gift	 And what does the Mother's mercy entail? It depends upon the situation.
s05e07	The Gift	 The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.
s05e07	The Gift	 Thank you, High Septon, for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
s05e07	The Gift	 Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing? I think I may have heard at one point.
s05e07	The Gift	 Baelor built his sept around it.
s05e07	The Gift	 But men worshipped here long before him.
s05e07	The Gift	 Who carved this altar? - Do you know? - I'm afraid I don't.
s05e07	The Gift	 No one does.
s05e07	The Gift	 There's no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel.
s05e07	The Gift	 No, the people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on those who came after them the way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there.
s05e07	The Gift	 Hmm.
s05e07	The Gift	 Their faith was clean.
s05e07	The Gift	 Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains.
s05e07	The Gift	 Something simple and solid and true.
s05e07	The Gift	 The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.
s05e07	The Gift	 Their lies knocked down.
s05e07	The Gift	 Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.
s05e07	The Gift	 And so it will be for all of us.
s05e07	The Gift	 High and low alike.
s05e07	The Gift	 What will we find when we strip away your finery? A young man came to us not long ago.
s05e07	The Gift	 Broken in body and spirit.
s05e07	The Gift	 He had so much to strip away.
s05e07	The Gift	 So much weighing him down.
s05e07	The Gift	 But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.
s05e07	The Gift	 Let go of vanity, pride, sin.
s05e07	The Gift	 Now his soul is so light, he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird.
s05e07	The Gift	 Hmm.
s05e07	The Gift	 And he has much to say about you.
s05e07	The Gift	 Move.
s05e07	The Gift	 Let me go immediately.
s05e07	The Gift	 You will order her to let me go.
s05e07	The Gift	 I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! Get your filthy hands off me! Have you lost your mind? I am the queen! Let me go! Look at me.
s05e07	The Gift	 Look at my face.
s05e07	The Gift	 It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
s05e08	Hardhome	Your Grace, I want to say-- You will not speak.
s05e08	Hardhome	 How do I know you are who you say you are? If only I were otherwise.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine? You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister on the day I was born.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family? Into your service? Your Grace, we have only just met.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If you'd rather return to the fighting pits, just say the word.
s05e08	Hardhome	 When I was a young man, I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who'd been sent to kill her.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And then a few years later, the most well-informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time, along with three dragons.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you? Because you cannot build a better world on your own.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The strengths and weaknesses of the houses that will either join or oppose you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I will have a very large army and very large dragons.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Killing and politics aren't always the same thing.
s05e08	Hardhome	 When I served as Hand of the King, I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If that is indeed what you are.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So you want to advise me? Very well.
s05e08	Hardhome	 What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I know.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises? Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I can't remember ever seeing a sane man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And yet he did betray you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal? Yes.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Many opportunities.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And did he? No, not until forced to do so.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He worships you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He is in love with you, I think.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But he did not trust you with the truth.
s05e08	Hardhome	 An unpleasant truth to be sure, but one of great significance to you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So I should kill him? A ruler who kills those devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And you're going to need to inspire devotion, a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But you cannot have him by your side when you do.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Confess.
s05e08	Hardhome	 My son.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Let me speak to-- Confess.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I meant it.
s05e08	Hardhome	 My face will be the last thing you see-- My name is Lanna.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm an orphan.
s05e08	Hardhome	 When I was eight, I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It took a while, but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Now every morning, I make my way down to the canals.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on her way home.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane-- Turn left onto Ragman Lane where I do most of my trade.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Lanna is very impressive.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Very industrious.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She will make a fine servant for the Many-Faced God.
s05e08	Hardhome	 How will she serve him? She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
s05e08	Hardhome	 What will she do there? She will see.
s05e08	Hardhome	 See what? How can a man tell a girl this? If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Oysters, clams, and cockles! Oysters, clams, and cockles! Oysters, clams, and cockles! Your oysters fresh? Best in the city.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you? Mm.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Very nice.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Give me four with vinegar.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's my 18th voyage.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Can't do it.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Please, I've three children.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Without me Here, take it.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You have to.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I've three children.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - What will they do? - Come on.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They've nothing without me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Please, you have to! Please, you don't understand! Please! The man is a gambler.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He wages that a sailor's ship will make it to its destination.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It is a strange wager for the captain.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He only wins if he loses his life.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So why would a captain make the wager in the first place? A girl tells a man that she has seen.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides he does not have to pay after all.
s05e08	Hardhome	 A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse? The Many-Faced God.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
s05e08	Hardhome	 A man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not.
s05e08	Hardhome	 A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She will watch the gambler.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And then what? A gift for the thin man.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She's not ready.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And if she's not? It is all the same to the Many-Faced God.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The trial will take place soon.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The charges? Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.
s05e08	Hardhome	 All lies.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Of course, Your Grace.
s05e08	Hardhome	 My concern is that the Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I wish you had said it sooner.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Is there any word from Jaime? No, I'm afraid not.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He now presides over the small council.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Tell him I need to speak to him.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I implored him to visit you, but he would not.
s05e08	Hardhome	 What about my son, the king? If you can visit me, then surely the king Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken them well.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He remains in his chambers.
s05e08	Hardhome	 His servants often find his food in the hall left untouched.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You need to talk to him.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me, come and see his mother.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He-- I tried, Your Grace.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He wouldn't see me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He won't see anyone.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I can't stay here.
s05e08	Hardhome	 There is a way, Your Grace.
s05e08	Hardhome	 A way out.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I made him.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I rose him up from nothing.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Good-bye, my queen.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The work continues.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Why? Why, Theon? I'm not Theon.
s05e08	Hardhome	 There is no Theon.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Reek.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Reek.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Why did you tell him, Reek? I was helping you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You wanted to escape.
s05e08	Hardhome	 There is no escape.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Not ever.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The master knew.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He knows everything.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He hunted him and caught him and strapped him to a cross and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Good.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If I could do what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I deserved everything.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I deserve to be Reek.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I did terrible things.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Turned on Robb.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Captured Winterfell.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Killed those boys.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - They weren't "those boys.
s05e08	Hardhome	" They were Bran and Rickon.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They were your brothers.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You've known them since they were born.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They weren't.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They were only-- Only what? - I can't.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Tell me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I can't, not unless the master says.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Tell me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They weren't what? - They weren't-- Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone while you still breathe the air.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Tell me to my face, Theon.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Tell me that they weren't your brothers! They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It was two farm boys.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You didn't? Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon? I can't talk to you anymore.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Theon, you have to tell me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Do you have any idea where-- Not Theon! Reek! Our scouts tell us he's got no more than 6,000 men.
s05e08	Hardhome	 More than half of those are mounted, however.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And how high do Stannis's horses jump? Our walls have been fully repaired.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The gates have been reinforced.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We have enough food for six months.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be.
s05e08	Hardhome	 All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You disagree? Stannis isn't from the North.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You are, Father.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And what do you recommend? That we not sit and wait for Stannis to decide what sort of fight this is going to be.
s05e08	Hardhome	 That we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows.
s05e08	Hardhome	 A smart commander does not abandon a defensive advantage.
s05e08	Hardhome	 As long as we stay behind these walls, they can't touch us.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Not to mention that the snow is so deep, we couldn't get an army through to engage them even if we wanted to.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I don't need an army.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I need 20 good men.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So, have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service? Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed? It's probably my safest option.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I can see why you would think so.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's what your father would have done.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And what would your father have done? My father, who publically sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Is that why you killed him? Someday, if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I know what my father was.
s05e08	Hardhome	 What he did.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I know the Mad King earned his name.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So, here we sit.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Two terrible children of two terrible fathers.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm terrible? I've heard stories.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible? - To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Which kind is that? The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Yes, that was wise.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Very impressive.
s05e08	Hardhome	 My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, gods forbid.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She ended up having him killed.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Perhaps it won't come to that.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Varys? King Robert's spymaster? Yes, he's the one who convinced me to come find you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.
s05e08	Hardhome	 For 20 years the Spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He did what he had to do to survive.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He did a lot of other things as well, things he didn't have to do.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But you trust him? Yes, oddly.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He may be the only person in the world I trust.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Except my brother.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The brother who killed my father? That's the one.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Your queenly prerogative.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If you chop off my head, well, my final days were interesting.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm not going to kill you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 No? Banish me? No.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So if I'm not going to be murdered and I'm not going to be banished-- You're going to advise me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 While you can still speak in complete sentences.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Advise you on what? How to get what I want.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The Iron Throne.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm not entirely joking.
s05e08	Hardhome	 There's more to the world than Westeros after all.
s05e08	Hardhome	 How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong, where you can do the most good.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I will continue that fight here and beyond.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But this is not my home.
s05e08	Hardhome	 When you get back to your home, who supports you? The common people.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people and only the common people.
s05e08	Hardhome	 What was that like? Ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The Starks are gone as well.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Our two terrible fathers saw to that.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The remaining members of House Lannister will never back you, not ever.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.
s05e08	Hardhome	 His entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours.
s05e08	Hardhome	 That leaves the Tyrells.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Not impossible, not enough.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They're all just spokes on a wheel.
s05e08	Hardhome	 This one's on top, then that one's on top.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm not going to stop the wheel.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm going to break the wheel.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I won.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - You struck me.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Have me flogged if it makes you happy.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But I'm the best you've got.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If I win at the Great Pit, how much can you sell me for? You're a free man.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You could have gone anywhere.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Why did you come back? Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Thirsty? Confess.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'll get out of here, you realize, before long.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Confess.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I can make you a wealthy woman.
s05e08	Hardhome	 A lady of the court.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Confess.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Or I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And all I do is sit here imagining hideous ways for you to die.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Does it hurt? No.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Good.
s05e08	Hardhome	 How are you? I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You know what I mean.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm good.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Are you scared? - A little.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Me, too.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Who's there? -  Olly.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Oh.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Come in.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I heard what happened.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Oh, not to worry.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Men brawl from time to time.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's only natural.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Figured you were hungry.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Oh, you're a good lad.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Wanted to ask you something if you've got the time.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I need to check on baby Sam.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Now then, how can I help? - It's about the Lord Commander.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Yes? He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Wildlings killed my mom and dad.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They killed everyone in my village.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We've been fighting them for years.
s05e08	Hardhome	 This wasn't a fight.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We were farmers and they slaughtered us.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So why is he saving them? Wildlings are people.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Just like us, there are good ones and bad ones.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.
s05e08	Hardhome	 -  Oh, Olly.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - How can he trust him? I've seen the army of the dead.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I've seen the white walkers.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And they're coming for us, for all the living.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And when it's time, we'll need every last man we can find.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But what if we let the wildlings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep? Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We don't stand a chance otherwise.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You believe that? With all my heart.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Try not to worry, Olly.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I've been worrying about Jon for years.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He always comes back.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Turn us about! You trust me, Jon Snow? Does that make me a fool? We're fools together now.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Lord of Bones.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Been a long time.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Last time I saw you, the little crow was your prisoner.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The other way around now.
s05e08	Hardhome	 What happened? War.
s05e08	Hardhome	 War? You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by some southern king.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We should gather the elders, find somewhere quiet to talk.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You don't give the orders here.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm not giving an order.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Why aren't you in chains? He's not my prisoner.
s05e08	Hardhome	 No? What is he? We're allies.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You fucking traitor.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You fight for the crows now? I don't fight for the crows.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We're not here to fight.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We're here to talk.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund? And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock? Gather the elders and let's talk.
s05e08	Hardhome	 My name's Jon Snow.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We're not friends.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We've never been friends.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We won't become friends today.
s05e08	Hardhome	 This isn't about friendship.
s05e08	Hardhome	 This is about survival.
s05e08	Hardhome	 This is about putting a 700-foot wall between you and what's out there.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You built that wall to keep us out.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Since when do the crows give two shits if we live? In normal times we wouldn't.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But these aren't normal times.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The white walkers don't care if a man's free folk or crow.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We're all the same to them, meat for their army.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But together we can beat them.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Run from them, maybe.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's not a trick.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's a gift for those who join us.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Dragonglass.
s05e08	Hardhome	 A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - You saw this? - No.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But I trust the man.
s05e08	Hardhome	 There are old stories about dragonglass.
s05e08	Hardhome	 There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them? Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Come with you where? There are good lands south of the Wall.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I knew Mance Rayder.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He wanted a new life for his people, for you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We're prepared to give you that new life.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If? If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Where is Mance? - He died.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - How? I put an arrow through his heart.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Hey, hey.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Hey, hey, hey.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Hey, none of you saw Mance die.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I did.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The southern king who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send us a message.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.
s05e08	Hardhome	 His arrow was mercy.
s05e08	Hardhome	 What he did took courage.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And that's what we need today, the courage to make peace with men we've been killing for generations.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I lost my father, my uncle, and two brothers fighting the damn crows.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm not asking you to forget your dead.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'll never forget mine.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But I'm asking you to think about your children now.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it.
s05e08	Hardhome	 No clan can stop them.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The free folk can't stop them.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The Night's Watch can't stop them.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And all the southern kings can't stop them.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Only together, all of us.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And even then it may not be enough, but at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You vouch for this man, Tormund? He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He's young, but he knows how to lead.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He didn't have to come to Hardhome.
s05e08	Hardhome	 He came because he needs us and we need him.
s05e08	Hardhome	 My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'll never trust a man in black.
s05e08	Hardhome	 But I trust you, Tormund.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If you say this is the way, we're with you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 This is the way.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm with Tormund.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We stay here, we're dead men.
s05e08	Hardhome	 At least with King Crow, there's a chance.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Tormund.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Keep that new life you want to give us.
s05e08	Hardhome	 And keep your glass, King Crow.
s05e08	Hardhome	 As soon as you get on his ships, they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.
s05e08	Hardhome	 That's our enemy.
s05e08	Hardhome	 That has always been our enemy.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I fucking hate Thenns.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Move it.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Be careful.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Move 'em along, now.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Cast-off time.
s05e08	Hardhome	 That's it, come on.
s05e08	Hardhome	 How many are with us? I'm not good at counting.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We're leaving too many behind.
s05e08	Hardhome	 The free folk are stubborn.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You know how long it took Mance to band them together? And he knew them better than I ever will.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They'll come around.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Get yourselves ready.
s05e08	Hardhome	 - Aye! Johnna is gonna look after you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 She's in charge.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You listen to her.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Take her.
s05e08	Hardhome	 There you are.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I want to go with you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I need to get the old folks on the boats.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I'm right behind you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I promise.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Go on.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Another one.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Keep moving.
s05e08	Hardhome	 We'll meet you out there.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Won't be able to take that on the boat.
s05e08	Hardhome	 It's too big.
s05e08	Hardhome	 -  That's the last one! -  Three more! Move on! There's more dragonglass everywhere.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I've got some more daggers over here.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Put that dagger in his bag.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Uh Steady! Shut the gates.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Close the gates! Shut the gates! Wait! - Open the gate! - Let us in! Help us! Please open it! Open the gate! Ready your arrows! - Wait! Wait! - Keep in line! Keep in line! Get in line! Get to the front! Go on, shoot it! - Wait, wait! - Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line! Lord Commander! Get them to the ship and come back for me! - But you'll never make-- - Now! - Let me on! - Let me on! - Bloody fucking move! - Let go! You should be on one of those boats.
s05e08	Hardhome	 So should you.
s05e08	Hardhome	 My little girls got on.
s05e08	Hardhome	 They're gonna let them pass the Wall even if you're not there? You have my word.
s05e08	Hardhome	 I've given orders.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders.
s05e08	Hardhome	 If they get through, everyone dies.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Night's Watch, with me! Move! Move! Move! No, no! - Tormund, the sleigh! - Okay, okay! The dragonglass.
s05e08	Hardhome	 You and me, then! Go! Get the glass.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Come on! The dragonglass.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Fuck the glass! We are gonna die here! Oh, fuck! Tormund, run! Wun Wun, to the sea.
s05e08	Hardhome	 Quickly! -  Faster, faster! -  Run, run! Quickly! - Quickly, row! Row! - Go, go, come on! Let's go! Now, now! Come on, row!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	A girl will return to the docks.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 She will watch the gambler.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And then what? A gift for the thin man.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Why should I spend my time listening to you? You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 What would you have me do with him? A ruler who kills those devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Let me fight for her.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The Iron Bank has called in the crown's debts.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We must send an envoy to show these bankers our respect.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Ser Meryn will lead your escort.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 There are only two like it in the world.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The one I'm wearing, the one I gave to Myrcella.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Dorne's too dangerous for you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I've come to take you home.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 This is about survival.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The white walkers don't care.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We're all the same to them, meat for their army.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But together we can beat them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We still have a hard march to Winterfell and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It's better to wait for the right time than risk everything.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 This is the right time and I will risk everything.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Because if I don't, we've lost.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I have shown you the power of king's blood.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We don't have Robert's bastard here.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The snow is so deep, we couldn't get an army through to engage them even if we wanted to.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I don't need an army.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I need 20 good men.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	    - Look out! - Fire! Fire! A band of 20 men, maybe less.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 They were in and out before anyone spotted them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons destroyed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Dozens of tents were-- - Horses? We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 without a single guard sounding the alarm? The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Put last night's guards in chains.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Either they fell asleep or they conspired with the enemy.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Find out the truth and then hang them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Your Grace.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We're not returning to Castle Black.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters, but if we can't march forward and we won't march back Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Halt!  Halt!  There it is! Open the gates.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It was a failure.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It wasn't.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I went to save them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I failed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You didn't fail him.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Or him.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Or her.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I don't think that fact's lost on them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You have a good heart, Jon Snow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It'll get us all killed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Out of my way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You sent for me, Your Grace? Find some healthy horses and a few knights to guard you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm sending you back to Castle Black.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Tell the Lord Commander his king commands him to send food, supplies, fresh horses.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 In return, when I take the throne, I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall if he so wishes.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Your Grace, you named me your Hand.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Yes.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The King's Hand should never abandon the king, especially in time of war.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You're not abandoning me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You're obeying a command.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And if Jon Snow refuses the boy with the scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you Hand for your expertise in military matters.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Ride for Castle Black.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Don't come back empty-handed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse and Princess Shireen could accompany me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 My family stays with me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 At least let me take Shireen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 A siege is no place for a little girl.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 My family stays with me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 What's this one now? "The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling" by Grand Maester Munkun.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Now that sounds like a proper story.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And he crouched behind it and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And burnt him to a crisp.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Thus ending the dragon-slaying career of Ser Byron Swann.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I made you something, Princess.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Do you like it? He's beautiful.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Thank you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - You're very welcome.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company? Of course I will.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But why am I getting a present? Because you deserve it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Gods, I was stubborn about it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Made it this far without reading.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Wish I'd listened to him.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 This is my own poor way of saying thank you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 For teaching me to be a grown-up.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'll be gone for a few days, Princess.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I want to hear all about "The Dance of Dragons" when I'm back.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You'll read it yourself.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Prince Doran.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Forgive us.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We started without you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Please, sit.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Princess Myrcella.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Uncle.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 What a lovely dress.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - You don't like it? - You must be cold.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Not at all.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The Dornish climate agrees with me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Prince Trystane.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 How's your jaw? A fleabite.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 What are you doing in Dorne? Looking after the safety of my niece, the Princess Myrcella.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly, you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force? We received a threatening message.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 That necklace was stolen from my room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oh, excellent.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 A last meal before the beheading? Oh, I can't behead you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Many in Dorne want war.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But I've seen war.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I've seen the orphans starving in the cities.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I don't want to lead my people into that hell.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And that is precisely what we are doing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital? I'm afraid he does.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I cannot disobey my king's command.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 She will return with you to King's Landing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue, their engagement must stand.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I accept.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 One more thing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 My brother was named to the small council before his death.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the fold.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You have my word.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The word of a kingslayer.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 No wonder you can't stand.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You have no spine.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Speak to me that way again, and you won't.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn? Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince? He said it was just a fleabite.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The fault is mine.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If anyone should be punished, it's me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'll let him decide.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I have learned the value of mercy from my father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - I'll set your man free.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - You're a good man.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 On one condition.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Why do we play? I'm better than you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'll always be better than you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Have I ever missed once? I don't think I have.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I can't recall.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You must love humiliation.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Or pain.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Which do you love most, humiliation or pain? That one hurt, didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - You're going to miss.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Oh, I never miss.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You will.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You're thinking too much.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Now you're nervous.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 What if she's right? - Luck.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Now it's my turn.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You're too slow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You've always been too slow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk? You'll find out very soon.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Say it one more time, handsome.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Who am I? The most beautiful woman in the world.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And that's the truth.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Slut.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I didn't realize there were knights of the Blackwater.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Only the one.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Prince.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Sorry about the other day.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm glad to hear it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Pie looks good.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 There was one condition.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Perhaps some soup instead.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oysters, clams, and cock-- How much for your little clam? Oysters, clams, and cockles.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Come on.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Is, uh - Girl! -  Tie her up! Are you deaf? Girl! Girl! My lord.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 My lord.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Lord Tyrell.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the Free City of Braavos.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I hope your journey was trouble-free.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 A bit of chop the last few days.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Nothing too awful.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Good to see the old chap still guarding the harbor.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And how goes the harvest in the Reach? Ah, the vintners say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm afraid I don't partake.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oh.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Pure nonsense, of course.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Most unfortunate for the glovers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If a man charges no interest on a loan, then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why chance it? Whereas the promise of reward makes a man willing to gamble.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You are the world's best gamblers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And all those bets you won built this.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We should celebrate.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oh, nonsense.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Work's over.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Do you sing? - I don't have that gift.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Oh, it's not a gift.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It's a skill.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Anyone can learn it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	  So give me a kiss by the Long Canal   And give me two kisses in Salty Town   For we're going to die tomorrow   The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown  Thought that old shit would never stop singing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Wasn't bad, though.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The Tyrells can all rot in hell.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Treasonous cunts.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 This is the place, lads.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The sleekest little minks in Braavos.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - You buying? - Oh, I'm buying.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But I never was good at sharing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Sell your fish somewhere else.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Oh, let her in, Brusco.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm hungry.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Come here, sweetness.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 They say oysters get the juices flowing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 We'll take half a dozen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Three coppers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Too old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Brea.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Too old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I have just the one.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Anara.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Our most expensive girl.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But well worth it, I assure you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Too old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Do you have what I want or not? Of course.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Of course.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 These fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Here.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Thank you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - I'll have one.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Any vinegar? Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo! Good.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'll tell you when we're done.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow? Of course.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'll have you whipped, girl.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Go, go on.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Out, out, go.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Valar morghulis.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Valar morghulis.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And? The thin man wasn't hungry today.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Perhaps that is why a man is thin.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Tomorrow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Tomorrow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 A girl has work to do.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Your rebellion is over.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I believe in second chances.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I don't believe in third chances.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You write like a seven-year-old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 He didn't try to make you pay? Mm-mmm.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Maybe he's changed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The queen will be thrilled to know you're bringing her daughter home.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 She will.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You love her very much, don't you? Of course, she's my niece.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I wasn't talking about her.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You think I disapprove? Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Here no one blinked an eye.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 no one would have blinked an eye at you if you'd been named Targaryen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I love.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Perhaps even you are innocent of that.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Aren't you cold? No.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 What are you reading? - "The Dance of Dragons.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	" - What's it about? It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 By the time it was over, thousands were dead.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 They never truly recovered.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 "The Dance of Dragons.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	" Why is that a dance? It's just what they call it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Hmm, doesn't make much sense.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I think it's poetic.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon who would you have chosen? I wouldn't have chosen either.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Sometimes a person has to choose.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Sometimes the world forces his hand.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is no choice at all.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 However much he may hate it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It's all right, Father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You don't even know what I'm talking about.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It doesn't matter.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I want to help you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Is there any way I can help? Yes, there is.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Good.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I want to.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And I'm your daughter.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Forgive me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Where's my father? I want to see my father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 It will all be over soon, Princess.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 No.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Where's my father? No, you can't do this.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Father, where are you? Please, let me see my father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Father, where are you? Don't let her do this.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Please let go! Let me see my father! Where are you? Please! - It's what the Lord wants.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - No.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Please! Let go! No! - It's a good thing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - A great thing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 -  Stop.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Stop! - Please! - Hear us now, my Lord.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	  You can't do this!  For you, we offer up this girl Please!  that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	  Please! No, please let me see my father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 If we don't act, we'll all starve here.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 -  All of us.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But if we make this sacrifice Accept this token of our faith, my Lord, and lead us from the darkness.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Lord of Light, show us the way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Mother! Mother, please! Mother, please! Mother! - Mother! - We can't.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 There's no other way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - She has king's blood.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 -  Please don't do this! Lord of Light, protect us.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Please! Father, please! For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Father! Father, don't do this! Please! Mother, no! Please! Please, help! Don't do this! Please, Father! Mother, help! No.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	  No, please! Don't do this! Don't do this, please, Mother! Please, Mother! Mother, help! Mother, help! Help! Please don't do this, Mother! Please! Please, Mother! Please! Please! No! Please! No! No! Where have you been? Just making sure everything is in order.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 They're waiting for you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Clap your hands.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 That one, the smaller man.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 No question, that's where you should put your money.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The smaller man it is.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm not putting my money anywhere.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Kings and queens never bet on the games.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 He would have bet against me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Common novice mistake.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I've spent much of my life in this arena.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And in my experience, large men do triumph over smaller men far more often than not.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You yourself? Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you? Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 They couldn't get their money out fast enough.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You don't approve? There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I can do without it in my leisure time.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Fair enough.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Yet it's an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty? It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm not talking about myself.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 That is greatness? That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 My father would have liked you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - At your command? - If need be.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 And how many people will die to make this happen? If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Those men think they're dying for a good reason.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Someone else's reason.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 So your reasons are true and theirs are false? They don't know their own minds, but you do? Well said.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You're an eloquent man.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Doesn't mean you're wrong.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Your Grace-- - Shut your mouth.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - You can end this.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - She cannot.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 You can.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Protect your queen! Go! Your Grace! Your Grace! Come with me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I know a way out.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 I know a way-- Stay close.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 This way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 The other side.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 - Follow me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	 Protect your queen! Drogon! Valahd.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	Brace the wind.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 His fires have melted the snows away.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The way ahead is clear.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 We ride for Winterfell.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And you will take it.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You will receive what is yours by right.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your Grace.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Prepare to form up.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your Grace.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Tell me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The men, many deserted before dawn.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 How many? Nearly half.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 All the sellswords with all the horses.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your Grace.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Speak up.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Can't be worse than mutiny.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Cut her down.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your Grace.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Get the men into marching formation.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 On to Winterfell.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He raised his hands and they all stood up at once.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Tens of thousands of them.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The biggest army in the world.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But the dragonglass No one's ever getting that back now.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Not unless we had a mountain of it.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But you killed a white walker.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 With Longclaw.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - But Longclaw - Is Valyrian steel.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms? Not enough.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? You were friends with me when I first came here.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Here's to us, then.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Long may they sneer.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 What? I wanted to ask you something.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 To ask something of you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a maester.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 That's what I'm meant to be.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Not this.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I need you here, Sam.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust? Well, there's Edd.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'd be more use to you as a maester.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Citadel has the world's greatest library.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'll learn about history, strategy, healing.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And other things, things that will help when-- when they come.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And the baby that she named after me will die.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Thank you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Oh, they'll bloody try.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Sam.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - What? Sam.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You had just been beaten half to death.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 How did you-- Oh, very carefully.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'll come back.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 To your return.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 To my return.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Aye, this way.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 My lady! Stannis.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Stannis Baratheon is coming.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 His whole army.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 How do you know it's Stannis? They're carrying his flaming heart banners.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 From the Blackwater.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'll never forget it.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Trench here.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Hurry them along.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Right, Curlew.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Yes, sir.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Dig between those two rises.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Spread out.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - I'm with you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Archers! - Spread out! And send out a foraging party immediately.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Siege begins at sunrise.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 We've got no chance! No, please, please.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Bolton has women fighting for him? I don't fight for the Boltons.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'm Brienne of Tarth.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You murdered him with blood magic? I did.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of His Name, rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Do you have any last words? Go on, do your duty.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Looks like we're done here.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I surrender! I surrender! And I accept your surrender.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Let's head back.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 My wife must be lonely.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 My lady.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I've come to escort you back to your chamber.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Go with her, please.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I know what Ramsay is.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I know what he'll do to me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's still some of me left.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your father was Warden of the North.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Ramsay needs you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Just the parts he'll use to make his heir, until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 So, shall we wait for him to come back or should we begin now? You're leaving it to me? Good.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Let's begin.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Reek-- stop! Stop! Open the gate! He's coming back.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I can see I have my work cut out for me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You two, out.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You were the first person on my list, you know.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 For killing Syrio Forel.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Remember him? Probably not.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I've gotten a few of the others.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Many-Faced God stole a few more from me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But I'm glad he left me you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Do you know who I am? I can't hear you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You know who I am.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'm Arya Stark.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Do you know who you are? You're no one.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You're nothing.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 A girl has taken a life.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The wrong life.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I was right about her.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You were.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You're not ready.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Not at all.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 That man's life was not yours to take.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Now a debt is owed.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Only death can pay for life.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 No! No! No, you-- don't die! Don't die! Why are you crying? He was my friend.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 No, he wasn't.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Didn't you listen to him? He was no one.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But if you're-- who's this? No one at all.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The faces are for no one.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You are still someone.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And to someone, the faces are as good as poison.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I can't see.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 What's happening? What's happening?! - I wish you a safe journey home.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Thank you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Forgive me, child.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I wish you all the happiness in the world.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Maybe I'll come visit you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Don't wait too long.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Got a noblewoman to marry back home.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Whenever you're ready, my lord.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Try not to lose it this time.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'll never take it off again.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I know you didn't want to leave Dorne, but I'm glad you're coming home.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your mother's desperate to see you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He seems like a nice boy.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You're lucky.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Arranged marriages are rarely so-- so well arranged.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Do you think Mother will like him? If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You really believe that? Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children? She likes you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'm not so sure about that.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Listen there's something I wanted to tell you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Something I should have told you long ago.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 So now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be, people can be.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 It was an accident, really.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I mean, what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is we don't choose whom we love.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 It just, well-- it's beyond our control.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - I sound like an idiot.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - No, you don't.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying and failing to say-- I know what you're trying to say.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 No, I'm afraid you don't.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I do.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I know.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 About you and Mother.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I think a part of me always knew.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And I'm glad.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'm glad that you're my father.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Myrcella? Myrcella? Myrcella? Myrcella? You love her, don't you? How could you not? Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But we always want the wrong woman.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Does he always talk so much? Jorah the Andal.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Torgo Nudho.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He should not be here.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 No, but he is.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Our queen would be dead if not for him.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 _ _ _ _ _ _ Puñila.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Thank you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I am sorry.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You missed a good scrap.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 None of that matters now.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The longer we sit here bantering, the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He's right.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The dragon headed north.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 We? You're a Lannister.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The queen intends to remove your family from power.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And I intend to help her do it.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Since she was little more than a child.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - You betrayed her.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Careful now.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And she exiled you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Twice, I believe.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The second time thanks to you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He's right.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Our queen exiled Jorah.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And he's right.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Jorah saved her life.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Perhaps she feels differently about him now.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Perhaps not.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The only way we'll know is if we ask her.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Fine, fine.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I suppose he can join us.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Forgive me, but why would we bring you? Pardon me? Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness? Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Can you fight? I have fought.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I don't claim to be a great warrior.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Are you good on a horse? Middling.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 So mainly you talk.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And drink.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I've survived so far.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You would help us here in Meereen, though.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 None of us have experience governing a city except for him.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Why would the Meereenese listen to him? They wouldn't.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 They will listen to Grey Worm.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'll come with you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I'll find our queen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - I am.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He is.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But you still can't go.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The people believe in you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 They know you speak for the queen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 It's true.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And Missandei.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Certainly not me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The queen's closest confidante, the commander of the Unsullied, and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Good fortune, my friends.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Meereen is ancient and glorious.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Try not to ruin her.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Let's find some good horses.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 We have so much to talk about.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Hello, old friend.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east, if one knows how to listen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Now the heroes are off to find her and I'm stuck here trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Any advice for an old comrade? Information is the key.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If only.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 A grand old city choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast? I did miss you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Oh, I know.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 We have to go home.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Oh, my poor, sweet thing.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Does it hurt? We have to go home.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Drogon.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Can you take me back to Meereen? How far did you carry me? Drogon, we need to return.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 My people need me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Well, there's no food.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Confess.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Confess.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I have sinned.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I see that now.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 How can I have been so blind for so long? I want to be clean again.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I want absolution.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And by its holy light-- You wish to make a confession? Once I've confessed, will I be free? Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Mother have mercy, then.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I confess.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Name him.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Lancel Lannister.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your cousin and the king's squire.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - I was lonely and afraid.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - You had a husband.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 A husband off whoring every chance he-- His sins do not pardon your own.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 May the gods forgive me.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Other men? No.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 No others? No.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You understand this? I do.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 There are those that say your children were not fathered by King Robert, that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 A lie.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He wants the throne, but his brother's children stand in his way.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 So he claims they are not his brother's.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 That filth.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 There is not one shred of truth to it.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I deny it.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Good.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But these are terrible charges.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 And the realm must know the truth of them.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Trial? I have confessed.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 To a single sin.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Others you have denied.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I haven't seen my son-- I don't know how long it's been.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I need to see him, please.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 You have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Thank you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Thank you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The Mother is merciful.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 It is her you should thank.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I will.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I will.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I swear it, day and night.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Good.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Am I free to go? After your atonement.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 My atonement? A sinner comes before you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Cersei of House Lannister.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Mother to His Grace King Tommen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Widow of His Grace King Robert.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her to you, the good people of the city.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 She comes before you with a solemn heart, shorn of secrets, naked before the eyes of gods and men to make her walk of atonement.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.

s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Shame.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Your Grace.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 It's good to have you back.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Come.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 We'll take you inside.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 I need to have a look at those feet.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard? If it please Your Grace, he has taken a holy vow of silence.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 He has sworn that he will not speak until all His Grace's enemies are dead and evil has been driven from the realm.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Who came to your aid? Stannis.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Now he needs you.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 We don't have enough men to make any difference.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The wildlings will make a difference.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - I told him before.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - You saved their bloody lives.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our Wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - It's not their fight.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Open the gates! Stannis? Shireen? The princess? Lord Commander.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 It's one of the wildlings you brought back.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Says he's still alive.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Are you sure he's talking about Benjen? Said he was First Ranger.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Said he knows where to find him.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome at the last full moon.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Could be lying.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Could be.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 There are ways to find out.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 - Where is he? - Over there.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 For the Watch.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 For the Watch.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 For the Watch.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 For the Watch.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 For the Watch.
s05e10	Mother's Mercy	 Olly For the Watch.
s06e01	The Red Woman	(theme music playing)   (wind blowing)  (wolf howling)  (howling continues)  (howling continues)  (door rattles)  (howling continues)  (door rattling)  (wolf whimpering)  (rattling continues)  (howling continues)  (Ghost whimpering, howling)  - (rattling continues) - (whimpering, howling continue)  Man: It's coming from the courtyard.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - (Ghost howling) - Man #2: It's the Lord Commander!  Help me get him inside.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (howling continues)  (door closes)  Thorne did this.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?  Trust?  The men in this room.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Davos: Does the wolf know you?  We need all the help we can get.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (knocking on door)  Melisandre: Ser Davos.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (door closes)  Melisandre: I saw him in the flames  fighting at Winterfell.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I can't speak for the flames  but he's gone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (men shouting)  Man: He was our Lord Commander.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Man #2: He never should have been!  (pounds)  - You all know why you're here.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - (shouting stops)  (men murmuring)  Jon Snow is dead.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Who killed him?  - I did.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - (shouting resumes)  And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck  and the other officers in this castle.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - Murderers! - Traitors!  - (men shouting) - (pounds on table)  - You're right! - (shouting stops)  We've committed treason, all of us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I had no love for him.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  That was no secret.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  But I never once disobeyed an order.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Loyalty is the foundation  on which the Night's Watch is built.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And the Watch means everything to me.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I have given my life,  we have all given our lives to the Night's Watch.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  He let the wildlings through our gates  as no Lord Commander has ever done before.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  He gave them the very land on which they reaved  and raped and murdered.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right,  I've no doubt about that.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And what he thought was right would have been the end of us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  He thrust a terrible choice upon us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And we made it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (men murmuring)  (whimpering)  Davos: He'll have seen we didn't come.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Thorne will have made it official by now.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Castle Black is his.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I don't care who's sitting at the high table.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Jon was my friend.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And those fuckers butchered him.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Now we return the favor.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We don't have the numbers.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - We have a direwolf.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - It's not enough.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,  but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We all die today.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We need to fight, but we don't need to die.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - Not if we have help.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Who is gonna help us?  You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Bolt the door.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Don't let anyone in.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I'll be back as soon as I can.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (door closes)  (bolt clicks)  (wind howling)  Ramsay: She was 11 the first time I saw her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The kennelmaster's daughter.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She smelled of dog.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You certainly were.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Myranda wasn't, though.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?  She was fearless.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  There was nothing she wouldn't do.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I wish you could be here to watch.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Maester: Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?  Or would you rather the men build a pyre?  Buried, burned?  This is good meat.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Feed it to the hounds.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Roose: Your command of the cavalry was impressive.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Do you know who struck the killing blow?  - No.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - A shame.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I'd reward the man.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Still, a great victory.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Do you feel like a victor?  I rebelled against the crown  to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Do you think that burning wagons in the night  and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons  is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?  No.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  A reckoning will come.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We need the North to face it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The entire North.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  They won't back us without Sansa Stark.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We no longer have Sansa Stark.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You played your games with her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  They won't get far.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I'm glad to hear it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And without an heir, well  let's hope the maesters are right  and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (dogs barking)  (barking continues)  (panting)  We can't stop.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (barking continues)  We have to cross here.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - (gasps) I can't.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - It's the only way to throw off the hounds.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  But it's too cold.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 I can't.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 I won't make it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 I'll die.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I've seen what his hounds do to a person.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  This way is better.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (barking continues)  (gasping)  (shivering)  (gasping)  Over here.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 Come on.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (shivering)  Sansa.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Sansa.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (dogs barking)  Man: Tell them to settle down!  Stay here.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 I'll lure them away.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  No, I won't make it without you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You will.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Go north, only north.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  He'll help you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (barking, howling)  (men shouting)  Man: See somebody, eh?  - Man #2: There they are! - Man #3: Get them!  Where is Lady Bolton?  - Dead.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Liar.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Theon: She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I left her to die in the snow.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (barking)  Got something! Run!  (horse whinnies)  Man: Hyah!  - (dogs barking) - (men shouting)  (whimpering)  - (horse whinnies) - Man #2: Resist.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 Stay.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (growling, barking)  - (barking continues) - Man #2: Stay.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I can't wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (man #3 grunting)  (whimpering)  (horse whinnies)  Man #2: Rider! Who is it?  - It's a bloody woman.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - (shouts)  (whinnies)  (roars)  (grunts)  (groans)  (shouts)  (whinnies)  (neighs)  (whinnies)  (groans)  (groaning)  No! Please! (grunts)  (panting)  (squelches)  (gasping)  Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I will shield your back and keep your counsel  and give my life for yours if need be.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I swear it by the old gods and the new.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And I vow  that you shall always have a place by my hearth  and  Meat and mead at my table.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  meat and mead at my table.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And I pledge to ask no service of you  that might bring you dishonor.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I swear it by the old gods and the new.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Arise.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (seagulls screeching)  (door opens)  Handmaiden: Your Grace, I'm sorry to disturb you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Myrcella.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (seagull screeching)  (bell tolling)  Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?  Mother.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  All I could think about when she died  was what would happen to her now.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Every day, every night,  what does Mama look like now?  Has she started to bloat?  Has her skin turned black?  Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Shh, shh.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 Don't think about it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I have to.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I have to.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 It's not right she has to suffer alone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She's not suffering.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 She's gone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  No one can hurt her anymore.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She was good.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  From her first breath, she was so sweet.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I don't know where she came from.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She was nothing like me.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  No meanness, no jealousy, just good.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I know.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I thought if I could make something so good,  so pure  - maybe I'm not a monster.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Listen-- listen to me.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She was my daughter and I failed her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  No, I knew this would happen.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The witch told me years ago.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  "And gold their shrouds.
s06e01	The Red Woman	"  Everything she said came true.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You couldn't have stopped it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  It's prophecy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 It's fate.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - You don't believe that.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Of course I do.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You told me yourself when Father died.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You said we had to stay together.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  That was a prophecy, too.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Fuck prophecy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 Fuck fate.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Fuck everyone who isn't us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We're the only ones who matter,  the only ones in this world.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And everything they've taken from us,  we're going to take back and more.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We're going to take everything there is.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  "The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  They scream in agony and their shame is so great,  they do not feel the flames,  for now they see if not for a single sin  they concealed, they were saved.
s06e01	The Red Woman	"  I'd like to see my brother.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - Confess.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Please.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  How is he? At least tell me that.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Confess.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Sinners don't make demands.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  They make confessions.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (gasps)  (door opens)  Septa Unella.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (sighs) Our other guests need you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - (gasps) - There.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I'll speak with her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  My brother, can you tell me how he is?  It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Your husband misses you dearly.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The love between a man and wife is sacred.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  But sin leads us away from the sacred.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And only confession can purge sin.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I have nothing to confess.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  So you believe you are pure?  Perfect?  Wholly without sin?  None of us are.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You have started down the path.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  But you have many miles to go.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (door opens, closes)  I always envied Oberyn.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  He lived.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  He truly lived.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Sailed around the world.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Fought men from every country.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - And men.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - And men.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  He experienced everything  while I sat here in Dorne  trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  But that is life.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We each have our roles.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And I was born to rule.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The gods are not fools.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You would have been a lousy adventurer.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And Oberyn, pfft,  he would have been a terrible ruler.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?  Maester: Prince Doran.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The Princess Myrcella.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (gasping)  When was the last time you left this palace?  You don't know your own people.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - Their disgust for you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - (Doran coughing)  Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You're not a Dornishman.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You're not our prince.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  My son Trystane  (scoffs)  Your son is weak just like you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I told you I'm not hungry.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We're not here to feed you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We're here to kill you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You want her to do it or me?  We are family.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 I don't want to hurt you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Her or me?  You.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Good.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Smart boy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You're a greedy bitch, you know that?  (door opens, door closes)  Tyrion: We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city  from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We'll be fine.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We're dressed like common merchants.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You walk like a rich person.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?  You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Because you have no cock.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (baby fussing)      She thinks you want to eat her baby.
s06e01	The Red Woman	        (speaks Valyrian)  - Varys: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - I know what mhysa means.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - Varys: Who wrote it? - Hard to know.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The Sons of the Harpy?  Very possibly.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property,  told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You can see why they're unhappy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Of course,  it could also be the freed men.
s06e01	The Red Woman	        Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
s06e01	The Red Woman	          It's a problem.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Whoever you are, wherever you go,  someone in this city wants to murder you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We can't fight an enemy we don't know.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack  in the fighting pits very carefully,  which means they take orders from someone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And have you started looking for that someone?  My little birds have already taken wing.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (men shouting in Valyrian)  - (people shouting) - (bell tolling)  - (shouting continues) - (bell continues tolling)  Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Goat?  Ram.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You think our friend got him?  Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We're on the right path, then.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Daario: Perhaps she's tired of being queen.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I don't think she likes it very much.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  She's too smart to like it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Maybe she's flown somewhere else,  somewhere far away from men like us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I've been all over the world.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  There's no escaping men like us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  There's no escaping her, eh?  You keep coming back.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 Why?  You know why.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Isn't it frustrating  wanting someone who doesn't want you back?  Of course it is.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You're a romantic.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 I admire that.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Sometimes I look at you and I think,  "So that's what I'll be like when I grow old.
s06e01	The Red Woman	"  If you grow old.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  If I grow old.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I hope I do.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I want to see what the world looks like  when she's done conquering it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  So do I.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Daario: Huh, an army?  Not an army.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  A horde.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Dothraki?  They have her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (people shouting)  - (shouts in Dothraki) - (groans)                  (chuckles, kisses)            No.
s06e01	The Red Woman	                                                  (men laugh)                                                        (chatter)  (distant dog barking)  Woman: But there has to be a price to pay for everything.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Man: I know, but have you tried telling him that?  (chatter continues)  Thank you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Man: Who'd go there after what happened to that Kingsguard?  - Man #2: Probably had it coming.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Man: Maybe so,  but I'm not risking it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - Man #2: Just can't do it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Man: All right.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Woman: Honesty as well.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 He gets it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (chatter continues)  Waif: Are you listening, blind girl?  Do you hear them talking?  Do any of them talk to you?  No.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  So sad.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (coins jingle)  - (groans) - Stand and fight, blind girl.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I can't see.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  That's your problem, not mine.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (groans)  (grunts)  (panting)  (grunts)  See you tomorrow.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (panting)  (growling)  (pounding)  Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We are both anointed knights.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Alliser: I will grant amnesty to all brothers  who throw down their arms before nightfall.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south  a free man with a fresh horse.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Davos: And some mutton.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I'd like some mutton.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - What? - I'm not much of a hunter.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it south without starving.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We'll give you food.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  Thank you, Ser Alliser.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  (footsteps departing)  Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  In my learned opinion, we open that door--  And they'll slaughter us all.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  They want to come in, they're gonna come in.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  - Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them.
s06e01	The Red Woman	 - Edd is our only chance.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  It's a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  There's always the Red Woman.
s06e01	The Red Woman	  What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?  You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.
s06e02	Home	Surrender by nightfall, or this ends with blood.
s06e02	Home	  We all die today.
s06e02	Home	  We don't need to die, not if we have help.
s06e02	Home	  You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
s06e02	Home	  We're going to have a baby.
s06e02	Home	  A reckoning will come,  we need the North to face it.
s06e02	Home	  The entire North.
s06e02	Home	  I have a team of men after them.
s06e02	Home	  They won't get far.
s06e02	Home	  Lady Sansa, I will give my life for yours if need be.
s06e02	Home	  Theon disobeyed my orders.
s06e02	Home	  The boy's a fool.
s06e02	Home	  He's my brother.
s06e02	Home	 He's a Greyjoy.
s06e02	Home	  Karstarks are Northmen.
s06e02	Home	  They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
s06e02	Home	  Stand and fight, blind girl.
s06e02	Home	  See you tomorrow.
s06e02	Home	  We won't be sailing to Westeros any time soon.
s06e02	Home	  They're dragons, Khaleesi, they can never be tamed.
s06e02	Home	  You're a warg, Bran.
s06e02	Home	 It's in your blood.
s06e02	Home	  He waits for you.
s06e02	Home	  You're the three-eyed raven.
s06e02	Home	   Give him another go, Ned.
s06e02	Home	  That's my father.
s06e02	Home	  And my Uncle Benjen.
s06e02	Home	  Keep your shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell.
s06e02	Home	  They were all so happy.
s06e02	Home	  So were you once.
s06e02	Home	  Stop showing off.
s06e02	Home	  Lyanna!  My Aunt Lyanna.
s06e02	Home	  I've seen her statue in the crypt.
s06e02	Home	  My father never talked about her.
s06e02	Home	  Would you get out of here? We're sparring.
s06e02	Home	  Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?  I don't know.
s06e02	Home	  What about him?  Wylis, come here.
s06e02	Home	  Hodor?  But he's got giant's blood.
s06e02	Home	  And you've got training.
s06e02	Home	 Sounds like a fair match to me.
s06e02	Home	  Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.
s06e02	Home	  And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.
s06e02	Home	  Hodor talks?  You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis.
s06e02	Home	  Come along, now.
s06e02	Home	 It's no place for you.
s06e02	Home	  Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.
s06e02	Home	  If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable.
s06e02	Home	  Well, he's never going to learn to fight because he's a stable boy.
s06e02	Home	  So leave him be.
s06e02	Home	  It is time to go.
s06e02	Home	  Please, a little longer.
s06e02	Home	  You finally show me something I care about  and then you drag me away.
s06e02	Home	  It is beautiful beneath the sea,  but if you stay too long, you'll drown.
s06e02	Home	  I wasn't drowning.
s06e02	Home	 I was home.
s06e02	Home	  Wylis.
s06e02	Home	  Hodor.
s06e02	Home	  I saw you as a boy.
s06e02	Home	  You could talk.
s06e02	Home	  What happened?  Hodor.
s06e02	Home	  Where's Meera?  Hodor.
s06e02	Home	  You shouldn't be here.
s06e02	Home	  It's not safe outside the cave.
s06e02	Home	  It's not safe anywhere.
s06e02	Home	  I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.
s06e02	Home	  - Hodor.
s06e02	Home	 - His real name is Wylis.
s06e02	Home	  And he could talk and fight and-- and then--  What's wrong?  The Three-Eyed Raven says there's a war coming.
s06e02	Home	  And we're going to fight it in there?  Brandon Stark needs you.
s06e02	Home	  For what? I sit in there  and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.
s06e02	Home	  He isn't going to stay here forever.
s06e02	Home	  And out there he needs you.
s06e02	Home	  It's time, Ser Davos.
s06e02	Home	  Open the door and the men inside  can rejoin their brothers in peace.
s06e02	Home	  We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs.
s06e02	Home	  Nobody needs to die tonight.
s06e02	Home	  I've never been much of a fighter.
s06e02	Home	  Apologies for what you're about to see.
s06e02	Home	  Come on.
s06e02	Home	  Attack!  Fight, you cowards!  You fucking traitor.
s06e02	Home	  The only traitors here are the ones  who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander's heart.
s06e02	Home	  For thousands of years the Night's Watch  has held Castle Black against the wildlings.
s06e02	Home	  Until you.
s06e02	Home	  Throw them into the cells where they belong.
s06e02	Home	  Took a lot of knives.
s06e02	Home	  I'll have my men get the wood for a fire.
s06e02	Home	  Bodies to burn.
s06e02	Home	  Shh, hey.
s06e02	Home	  Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei,  tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.
s06e02	Home	  All of a sudden she looks my way.
s06e02	Home	  Gives me a little smile like, "Well?"  So, all right, you know, I've never been shy  and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out.
s06e02	Home	  She's never seen anything like it.
s06e02	Home	  I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear,  Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch.
s06e02	Home	  Ooh!  She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips.
s06e02	Home	  Well, you all know me.
s06e02	Home	  You know I wouldn't lie about this.
s06e02	Home	  Get out of my way.
s06e02	Home	  King's orders, Your Grace.
s06e02	Home	  What are the king's orders?  He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace,  for your own protection.
s06e02	Home	  You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?  Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's command, I cannot let you pass.
s06e02	Home	  I would like to speak to my son.
s06e02	Home	  He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.
s06e02	Home	  She grew up.
s06e02	Home	  Almost.
s06e02	Home	  Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?  I expect it was Mother.
s06e02	Home	  Your mother wouldn't do that.
s06e02	Home	  Yes, she would.
s06e02	Home	  Are you angry with her?  - Of course not.
s06e02	Home	 - Then why didn't you let her come?  She has every right to be here.
s06e02	Home	  They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.
s06e02	Home	  If she had tried--  They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.
s06e02	Home	  Not while I'm here.
s06e02	Home	  Why haven't you gone to see her?  Everything she endured, she did it for you.
s06e02	Home	  Don't you think I know that?  I'm sorry.
s06e02	Home	  But I can't.
s06e02	Home	  Why not?  When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery,  what did I do?  When they paraded her through the streets like a whore,  what did I do?  We all fail sometimes.
s06e02	Home	  The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm.
s06e02	Home	  If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother,  what good am I?  Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.
s06e02	Home	  Your Grace.
s06e02	Home	  Lord Commander.
s06e02	Home	  I want to see my wife.
s06e02	Home	  The gods wait for Queen Margaery  to confess her crimes and seek their mercy.
s06e02	Home	  The king must wait as well.
s06e02	Home	  Go and see your mother, Tommen.
s06e02	Home	  You're a bold man.
s06e02	Home	  On the contrary.
s06e02	Home	  I fear a great deal.
s06e02	Home	  The Father, the Mother,  the Warrior.
s06e02	Home	  Do you know why we use these stones?  To remind us not to fear death.
s06e02	Home	  We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.
s06e02	Home	  You must long for the next life.
s06e02	Home	  In truth, I fear that, too.
s06e02	Home	  You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.
s06e02	Home	  Your sister sought the gods' mercy  and atoned for her sin.
s06e02	Home	  What about my sins?  I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back.
s06e02	Home	  I killed my own cousin.
s06e02	Home	  When the gods judged my brother guilty,  I helped him escape their justice.
s06e02	Home	  What atonement do I deserve?  You would spill blood in this holy place?  Oh, the gods won't mind.
s06e02	Home	  They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.
s06e02	Home	  Go on, then.
s06e02	Home	  I deserve it.
s06e02	Home	 We all do.
s06e02	Home	  We are weak, vain creatures.
s06e02	Home	  We live only by the Mother's mercy.
s06e02	Home	  They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.
s06e02	Home	  I don't.
s06e02	Home	  They'd never reach me before you struck.
s06e02	Home	  I've fought against worse odds.
s06e02	Home	  No doubt many of us would fall.
s06e02	Home	  But who are we, hmm?  We have no names, no family.
s06e02	Home	  Every one of us is poor and powerless.
s06e02	Home	  And yet together,  we can overthrow an empire.
s06e02	Home	  Mother.
s06e02	Home	  Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?  Gold.
s06e02	Home	  Good.
s06e02	Home	 It was always her color.
s06e02	Home	  I'm sorry for keeping you here.
s06e02	Home	  I shouldn't have, but I was--  I didn't want to lose you again.
s06e02	Home	  I understand.
s06e02	Home	  I'm glad to see you.
s06e02	Home	  I know I should have come sooner.
s06e02	Home	  I wanted to.
s06e02	Home	 I was wrong.
s06e02	Home	  It's all right.
s06e02	Home	  No, it isn't.
s06e02	Home	  I should have executed all of them.
s06e02	Home	  I should have pulled down the sept  onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you,  as you would have for me.
s06e02	Home	  You raised me to be strong  and I wasn't.
s06e02	Home	  But I want to be.
s06e02	Home	  Help me.
s06e02	Home	  Always.
s06e02	Home	  If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time.
s06e02	Home	  Meaning no offense.
s06e02	Home	  He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.
s06e02	Home	  I do not make dwarf jokes.
s06e02	Home	  You think them.
s06e02	Home	  So, the fleet.
s06e02	Home	 It's been burned.
s06e02	Home	  We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.
s06e02	Home	  Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere.
s06e02	Home	  Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.
s06e02	Home	  Perhaps they can tell us their secret.
s06e02	Home	  The Masters have retaken both cities.
s06e02	Home	  Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers.
s06e02	Home	  What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.
s06e02	Home	  They are not eating.
s06e02	Home	  They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.
s06e02	Home	  Daenerys is the dragon queen.
s06e02	Home	  Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious.
s06e02	Home	  If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?  Dragons do not do well in captivity.
s06e02	Home	  - How do you know this? - That's what I do.
s06e02	Home	  I drink and I know things.
s06e02	Home	  The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros  ranged over hundreds of miles.
s06e02	Home	  Then Daenerys's ancestors  started chaining them up in pens.
s06e02	Home	  A few generations later,  the last dragons were no larger than cats.
s06e02	Home	  They must be unchained or they'll waste away.
s06e02	Home	  Missandei,  how many times were you in the company of these dragons?  - Many times.
s06e02	Home	 - And did they ever harm you?  Never.
s06e02	Home	  Dragons are intelligent.
s06e02	Home	  More intelligent than men according to some maesters.
s06e02	Home	  They have affection for their friends  and fury for their enemies.
s06e02	Home	  - I am their friend.
s06e02	Home	 - Do they know that?  They will.
s06e02	Home	 It's time they had their supper.
s06e02	Home	  I'm friends with your mother.
s06e02	Home	  I'm here to help.
s06e02	Home	  Don't eat the help.
s06e02	Home	  When I was a child,  an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.
s06e02	Home	  I begged him for one of you.
s06e02	Home	  "It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon," I told him.
s06e02	Home	  "It could be little like me.
s06e02	Home	"  Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.
s06e02	Home	  Then my father told me  the last dragon had died a century ago.
s06e02	Home	  I cried myself to sleep that night.
s06e02	Home	  But here you are.
s06e02	Home	  Next time I have an idea like that,  punch me in the face.
s06e02	Home	  What's your name?  What's your name?  - No one.
s06e02	Home	 - I don't believe that.
s06e02	Home	  You don't believe that.
s06e02	Home	  Who are you?  No one.
s06e02	Home	  If a girl says her name,  a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.
s06e02	Home	  A girl has no name.
s06e02	Home	  If a girl says her name,  a man will feed her tonight.
s06e02	Home	  A girl has no name.
s06e02	Home	  If a girl says her name,  a man will give her eyes back.
s06e02	Home	  A girl has no name.
s06e02	Home	  Come.
s06e02	Home	  Leave it.
s06e02	Home	  A girl is not a beggar anymore.
s06e02	Home	  We came upon the bodies on our way here.
s06e02	Home	  Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?  They obviously had help.
s06e02	Home	  I didn't think Lady Sansa killed them all by herself.
s06e02	Home	  Thank you for this report, Lord Karstark.
s06e02	Home	  We know where she's going.
s06e02	Home	  Her brother's at Castle Black.
s06e02	Home	  Ned Stark's last surviving son?  Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.
s06e02	Home	  So was I, Father.
s06e02	Home	  Your hold on the North will never be secure  as long as a Stark can walk through that door.
s06e02	Home	  Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side.
s06e02	Home	  And the few men left are barely men at all.
s06e02	Home	 Farm boys and thieves.
s06e02	Home	  With a small force, we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow--  Murder the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?  You'd unite every house in the North against us.
s06e02	Home	  We don't need every house in the North.
s06e02	Home	  The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks  command more soldiers than all the other houses combined.
s06e02	Home	  With their support, none could challenge us.
s06e02	Home	  The Starks lost my house the day King Robb cut off my father's head.
s06e02	Home	  It's time for new blood in the North.
s06e02	Home	  If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog,  you'll be treated as a mad dog.
s06e02	Home	  Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.
s06e02	Home	  My lords.
s06e02	Home	  Lady Walda has given birth.
s06e02	Home	  A boy.
s06e02	Home	  Red-cheeked and healthy.
s06e02	Home	  My congratulations, Lord Bolton.
s06e02	Home	  Congratulations, Father.
s06e02	Home	  I look forward to meeting my new brother.
s06e02	Home	  You'll always be my firstborn.
s06e02	Home	  Thank you for saying that.
s06e02	Home	  It means a great deal to me.
s06e02	Home	  Maester Wolkan,  send ravens to all the northern houses.
s06e02	Home	 Roose Bolton is dead.
s06e02	Home	  Poisoned by our enemies.
s06e02	Home	  How did he die?  Poisoned by his enemies.
s06e02	Home	  You're talking to your lord.
s06e02	Home	 Use respect.
s06e02	Home	  Forgive me, my lord.
s06e02	Home	  Send for Lady Walda and the baby.
s06e02	Home	  She's resting, my lord.
s06e02	Home	  At once, my lord.
s06e02	Home	  There he is.
s06e02	Home	  Isn't he wonderful?  May I hold him?  Of-- of course.
s06e02	Home	  Little brother.
s06e02	Home	  Lord Bolton sent for us.
s06e02	Home	  Have you seen him?  Of course.
s06e02	Home	 Follow me, Mother.
s06e02	Home	  Where is Lord Bolton?  Down!  It's all right.
s06e02	Home	 Come on, shh.
s06e02	Home	  It's cold out here, Ramsay.
s06e02	Home	 I need to feed him.
s06e02	Home	  Ramsay, where is your father?  Ramsay.
s06e02	Home	  Where is Lord Bolton?  I am Lord Bolton.
s06e02	Home	  Ramsay.
s06e02	Home	  Ramsay, please.
s06e02	Home	  I'll leave Winterfell.
s06e02	Home	 I'll go back to the Riverlands.
s06e02	Home	  Please.
s06e02	Home	  Ramsay.
s06e02	Home	  He's your brother.
s06e02	Home	  I prefer being an only child.
s06e02	Home	  I saw her with a man.
s06e02	Home	  I don't think he hurt her.
s06e02	Home	  She didn't want to leave him, he didn't want to leave her.
s06e02	Home	  You don't know which way she went?  I spent three days looking for her.
s06e02	Home	  She disappeared.
s06e02	Home	  How'd she look?  She looked good.
s06e02	Home	  She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.
s06e02	Home	  No, she wouldn't be.
s06e02	Home	  What happened at Winterfell?  I should have gone with you while I had the chance.
s06e02	Home	  It was a difficult choice, my lady.
s06e02	Home	  We've all had to make difficult choices.
s06e02	Home	  We shouldn't be lighting fires.
s06e02	Home	  It's not safe.
s06e02	Home	  He won't stop hunting us.
s06e02	Home	  We just have to make it to Castle Black.
s06e02	Home	  Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us.
s06e02	Home	  Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
s06e02	Home	  I won't let him.
s06e02	Home	  I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
s06e02	Home	  And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place.
s06e02	Home	  And the truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.
s06e02	Home	  And the truth about Robb, who I betrayed.
s06e02	Home	  When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.
s06e02	Home	  I don't want to be forgiven.
s06e02	Home	  I can never make amends to your family  for the things I've done.
s06e02	Home	  They'll keep you safer than I ever could.
s06e02	Home	  You're not coming with us?  I would have taken you all the way to the Wall.
s06e02	Home	  I would have died to get you there.
s06e02	Home	  May I take one of the horses?  Where will you go?  Home.
s06e02	Home	  The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.
s06e02	Home	  And the ironborn who held it?  They died fighting to a man.
s06e02	Home	  What is dead may never die.
s06e02	Home	  What is dead may never die.
s06e02	Home	  But they did  and our invasion died with them.
s06e02	Home	  Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
s06e02	Home	  Then we will take more.
s06e02	Home	  Why? For more pinecones and rocks?  Because I order it.
s06e02	Home	  We can defeat anyone at sea,  but we'll never hold lands and castles  against mainland armies.
s06e02	Home	  Not if our captains defy my orders,  abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.
s06e02	Home	  I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
s06e02	Home	  Then where is he?  Where is your kingdom?  We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war.
s06e02	Home	  That war is over.
s06e02	Home	  The last time we provoked them too far,  I watched from that window as they breached our walls  and knocked down our towers.
s06e02	Home	  I lost two brothers that day.
s06e02	Home	  And I lost three sons.
s06e02	Home	  The War of the Five Kings, they call it.
s06e02	Home	  Well, the other four are dead.
s06e02	Home	  When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you want.
s06e02	Home	  But for now, shut your mouth and obey  or I will make another heir who will.
s06e02	Home	  Let me pass.
s06e02	Home	  You fool, move aside for your king.
s06e02	Home	  Haven't I always, brother?  I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
s06e02	Home	  What is dead may never die.
s06e02	Home	  Has the custom changed since I've been gone?  Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?  You can mock our god without my help.
s06e02	Home	  I don't mock the Drowned God.
s06e02	Home	  I am the Drowned God.
s06e02	Home	  From Oldtown to Qarth,  when men see my sails, they pray.
s06e02	Home	  You're old, brother.
s06e02	Home	  You've had your time.
s06e02	Home	  Now let another rule.
s06e02	Home	  I heard you lost your mind  during a storm on the Jade Sea.
s06e02	Home	  They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
s06e02	Home	  They did.
s06e02	Home	  And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.
s06e02	Home	  I needed silence.
s06e02	Home	  What kind of an ironborn  loses his senses during a storm?  I am the storm, brother.
s06e02	Home	  The first storm and the last.
s06e02	Home	  And you're in my way.
s06e02	Home	  Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves.
s06e02	Home	  Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh.
s06e02	Home	  Pull his bones down to your depths  to rest beside his ancestors and his children.
s06e02	Home	  What is dead may never die.
s06e02	Home	  I'm going to find out who did this.
s06e02	Home	  I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.
s06e02	Home	  I swear it by the Salt Throne.
s06e02	Home	  The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon,  not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
s06e02	Home	  My father would have wanted me to rule.
s06e02	Home	  Your father does not get to choose.
s06e02	Home	 The law is clear.
s06e02	Home	  Perhaps you'll win.
s06e02	Home	  Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn.
s06e02	Home	  And perhaps not.
s06e02	Home	  Come in.
s06e02	Home	  I'm sorry, my lady.
s06e02	Home	 Didn't mean to interrupt.
s06e02	Home	  You interrupt nothing.
s06e02	Home	  I assume you know why I'm here.
s06e02	Home	  I will after you tell me.
s06e02	Home	  It's about the Lord Commander.
s06e02	Home	  The former Lord Commander.
s06e02	Home	  Does he have to be?  What are you asking?  Do you know of any magic  that could help him?  Bring him back?  If you want to help him, leave him be.
s06e02	Home	  Can it be done?  There are some with this power.
s06e02	Home	  - How? - I don't know.
s06e02	Home	  Have you seen it done?  I met a man who came back from the dead,  but the priest who did it--  it shouldn't have been possible.
s06e02	Home	  But it was.
s06e02	Home	 It could be now.
s06e02	Home	  Not for me.
s06e02	Home	  Not for you?  I saw you drink poison that should have killed you.
s06e02	Home	  I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
s06e02	Home	  Everything I believed,  the great victory I saw in the flames,  all of it was a lie.
s06e02	Home	  You were right all along.
s06e02	Home	  The Lord never spoke to me.
s06e02	Home	  Fuck him, then.
s06e02	Home	  Fuck all of them.
s06e02	Home	  I'm not a devout man, obviously.
s06e02	Home	  Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.
s06e02	Home	  I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.
s06e02	Home	  I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
s06e02	Home	  I never had this gift.
s06e02	Home	  Have you ever tried?  Please.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	(theme music playing)   (man breathing)  (breathing continues)  (breathing heavily)  (Ghost panting, whines)  (gasping)  Easy, easy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Easy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What do you remember?  They stabbed me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Olly  he put a knife in my heart.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I shouldn't be here.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The lady brought you back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Afterwards, after they stabbed you,  after you died, where did you go?  What did you see?  Nothing.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  There was nothing at all.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Lord let you come back for a reason.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Stannis was not the prince who was promised,  but someone has to be.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Could you give us a moment?  You were dead.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And now you're not.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That's completely fucking mad, seems to me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I can only imagine how it seems to you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I did what I thought was right.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And I got murdered for it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And now I'm back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Why?  I don't know.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Maybe we'll never know.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What does it matter?  You go on.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You fight for as long as you can.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I don't know how to do that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I thought I did, but  I failed.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Good.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Now go fail again.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (door opens)  They think you're some kind of god.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The man who returned from the dead.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'm not a god.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I know that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I saw your pecker.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What kind of god would have a pecker that small?  (both chuckle)  (winces)  (winces)  Your eyes are still brown.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Is that still you in there?  I think so.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Hold off on burning my body for now.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (laughs)  That's funny.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You sure that's still you in there?  (laughs)  (thunder crashing)  - (chatter) - (Sam groans)  You all right?  Yes.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Yes, I'm fine.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see  because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?  I don't think so.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Sea, see.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  They're spelled different, but they sound the same.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Yeah, they do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  It was before I learned how to read, obviously.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Sam, are you going to be sick?  Won't be long.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 We'll be in the south soon.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'm excited to see Oldtown.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Are you going to vomit again?  No.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 No, no, no.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Citadel doesn't admit women.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I stayed at Castle Black.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 There's no women allowed there.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Citadel isn't Castle Black.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester Aemon  to help me bend the rules.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'll stay in Oldtown, then.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  By yourself?  With a baby and no money?  So if we're not going to Oldtown,  where are you taking me?  To my home.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Horn Hill.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My father's-- well, my father,  but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  They'll take care of you both.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  "Wherever you go, I go, too.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	"  That's what you said.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That's all I want--  to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes  so you'll be safe.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Us and everyone else in the world.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I don't care about them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Well, no, I do, but I don't really.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I care about you and him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I know that, Sam.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And he does, too.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You're the only one who ever has.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If you think it's for the best,  we trust you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'd never do that to the father of my son.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (coughs)  (horses whinny)  (distant horse whinnies)  (horse whinnies)  That's my father.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The man beside him is Howland Reed,  Meera's father.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Ser Arthur Dayne.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Sword of the Morning.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Lord Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I looked for you on the Trident.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We weren't there.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Your friend the usurper  would lie beneath the ground if we had been.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Mad King is dead.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Why weren't you there to protect your prince?  Our prince wanted us here.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Where's my sister?  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And now it begins.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  No.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Now it ends.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (shouts)  (groans)  (shouts)  (gurgles)  (groans)  He's better than my father.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Far better.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But Father beat him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Did he?  I know he did.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Heard the story a thousand times.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (grunts)  He stabbed him in the back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (woman screams)  What's in the tower?  That's enough for one day.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We'll visit again another time.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - I want to see where he's going.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 - Time to go.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (screaming continues)  Father!  (gasps)  Why did you do that?  Take me back there.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 I want to go back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  No.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - He heard me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 - Maybe.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - Maybe he heard the wind.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 - He heard me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The past is already written.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 The ink is dry.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What's in that tower?  I want to go back there.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I've told you many times, stay too long  where you don't belong and you will never return.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Why do I want to return?  So I can be a cripple again?  So I can talk to an old man in a tree?  You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years  watching the world from a distance  as the roots grew through me?  So why did you?  I was waiting for you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I don't want to be you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (laughs) I don't blame you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You won't be here forever.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You won't be an old man in a tree.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But before you leave,  you must learn.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Learn what?  Everything.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (chatter)                                                                    I don't know how you stand it in all that leather.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If we could have the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You look lovely today, my dear.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 You really do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If you're going to torture me,  just call them back and get on with it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I am not a torturer.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Though it so often is what people deserve.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And it does provide answers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But they're usually the wrong answers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My job is to find the right answers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Do you know how I do that?  I do it by making people happy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'd like to make you happy, Vala.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That's your name, isn't it, Vala?  (chuckles) That's all right.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I know who you are and what you've done.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You've done a lot.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You've sacrificed your body for a cause,  which is more than most people do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy  murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers  brought here by a foreign queen  to destroy our city and our history.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I understand.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Well, that makes perfect sense  from your perspective.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I have a different perspective, of course.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective  just as I will try to see them from yours.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Because that is the only way  that I can make you and Dom happy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That is how you pronounce it-- Dom?  I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Such a handsome boy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Those big, brown eyes.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Good luck keeping the ladies away.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?  You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Children are blameless.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I have never hurt them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Your boy is in no immediate danger,  this I swear to you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But between us, dear,  you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We both know the penalty for that crime.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  How will poor Dom get on without his mother?  And with his breathing problem.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  So either you kill me or they do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  There is a third option, though.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask  one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Far too heavy for me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The boat sails at dawn.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You need to decide now.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  A new life for you and Dom  or  What should we do while we wait?  To pass the time, what should we do?  What should we talk about?  You speak 19 languages.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You two, you spend a great deal of time together.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What would you be talking about if I weren't here?  Patrol.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What we see on patrol.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Who we captured on patrol.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That's good.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 That's very good.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But that's a report.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I was thinking more of a conversation.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  A wise man once said the true history of the world  is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Who said this?  Me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Just now.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  All right, no conversations.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Let's play a game.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You don't play games, either one of you, ever?  Games are for children.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Missandei: My master Kraznys  would sometimes make us play games.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  There, that's a start.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - Only the girls.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 - No, no, no.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Not that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Of course not that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Innocent games.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Fun games.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Drinking games.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Missandei: We do not drink.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Until you do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  All right.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 No drinking.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We can play without drinking.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  It's a wonderful game.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 I invented it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Here's how it works.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I make a statement about your past.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If I'm wrong, I drink.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And if I'm right--  maybe we can't play without drinking.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (door opens)  Oh, you took your time.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Sorry.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - Some things you can't rush.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 - You found out?  The Good Masters of Astapor  and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  With help from their friends in Volantis.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Tyrion: You see?  You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We only have to worry about  the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We will do it again and execute the Masters.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,  who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?  If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?  We cannot.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Masters speak only one language.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  They spoke it to me for many years.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I know it better than my mother tongue.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  May it be the last thing they ever hear.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You may be right.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Grey Worm: So we will fight them?  - Possibly.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 - Possibly?  It's a conversation.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Tell me, can your little birds get a message  to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai,  and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?  Of course.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Men can be fickle,  but birds I always trust.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (children chatting quietly)  Your eye looks much better, Arthur.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  How's your mother's jaw?  Better.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And your father?  No one's seen him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And no one will.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That worked out rather nicely.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Will Lord Varys ever come back?  I don't think so.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Do you miss him?  He was nice.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He called us his little birds.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He gave us sweets.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  It's funny you should mention that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Guess what I happened to find today.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Candied plums from Dorne.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (laughing)  Now remember, if any of your friends  like sweets or need help, they can always come to me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  All I need in return are whispers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (door opens)  Qyburn: No need to be afraid.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  This is Ser Gregor.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He's friends with all my friends.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Run along now.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Varys's little birds?  Your little birds now, Your Grace.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What did you do to him exactly?  I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Oh, a number of things.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Does he understand what we're saying?  I mean, to the extent that he ever understood  complete sentences in the first place.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He understands well enough.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  So tell him to march into the sept  and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Ser Gregor can't face them all.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And he won't have to.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He'll only have to face one.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?  Not yet.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Don't stop at the city.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I want little birds in Dorne,  in Highgarden, in the North.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If someone is planning on making our losses their gains,  I want to hear it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If someone is laughing at the queen  who walked naked through the streets covered in shit,  I want to hear.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I want to know who they are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I want to know where they are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Pycelle: As bad as Lord Varys was, Qyburn is worse.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I told them all.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 I told them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He's arrogant, dangerous.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - And no one listened to my advice.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 - (door opens)  So here we are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And what he's done to Gregor Clegane  is an abomination.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We never sanctioned this experiment.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I for one think it will be in our best interest  to have the beast dest--  (farts)  - Can I help you? - Why are you here?  - My mother-- - I was invited, my dear,  to help deal with several troublesome issues,  such as the queen's imprisonment.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Thank you for bringing it up.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Margaery is the queen.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You are not the queen  because you're not married to the king.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I do appreciate these things  can get a bit confusing in your family.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  This is a small council meeting.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You have no position on the small council.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard  does have a position on the small council.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?  Well, um  I would say Ser Gerold Hightower  had a seat on the Mad King's council.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Of course, that was the Mad King.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  King Robert saw things differently.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - And King-- - (loud thud)  What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?  Do you consider the murder of your own blood  a troublesome issue?  The same women who murdered Myrcella  have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We've got a lot to discuss.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  All of us together.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  No, we cannot make you leave.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And you cannot make us stay.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  - (door opens) - (armor rattling)  (groans) Your Grace.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'm sorry, Your Grace.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That's not possible.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Not yet.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  When will it be possible?  When she's fully atoned for her sins.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You cut off her hair and marched her naked  through the streets in front of the whole city.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  That wasn't the full atonement?  No.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  She must stand trial before seven septons  so we can learn the true extent of her sins.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I am the king.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And what does that mean to you?  It means a great deal to me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The Crown and the Faith  are the twin pillars of the world.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Do you know who told me that?  Your mother.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My mother who is unclean?  My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?  How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?  How did men and women  first come to feel the Mother's presence, hmm?  It was through their own mothers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 You know that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Her love for you is more real  than anything else in this world  because it doesn't come from this world.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But you know that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You've felt it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You've seen her when she talks to you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Yes.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  It's a great gift.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  One I never had.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Envy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  One more thing for me to atone for.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Your Grace, do you-- may I?  Do you mind?  It's my knees.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Of course.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  When your mother made her walk of atonement,  she did it to get back to you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I still don't understand why you want to put her  through any more than she's already endured.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  It's not what I want.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 It's what the gods want.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  They make their will known to us and it's up to us  to either accept or reject it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Please.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If we're to be just and good,  then we accept it, all of us, even kings.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  A true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And no one is wiser than the gods.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My grandfather once said something similar.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Except for the part about the gods.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  As they work through your mother.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  There's so much good in all of us.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (gasps)  (gasps)  Who are you?  No one.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (grunts)  Waif: Who were you before you came here?  Arya: Arya Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (grunts)  Waif: Tell me about Arya Stark's family.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Her father was Eddard Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Her mother was Catelyn Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  She had one sister, Sansa,  and four brothers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (panting)  Three brothers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Robb, Bran, Rickon.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And a half-brother Jon.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And where are they now?  Arya: They may be dead for all a girl knows.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (sniffs)  (sniffs)  Tell me about the Hound.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Arya: Also dead.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Arya Stark left him to die.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 He was on her list.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He was not on her list anymore.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  She had taken him off it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?  Arya: She did and she did not.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  She sounds confused.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Yes, she was.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?  - (groans) - Arya: Cersei Lannister.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Gregor Clegane.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Walder Frey.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (rustling)  Waif: That's a short list.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (panting)  That can't be everyone you want to kill.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?  Which name would you like a girl to speak?  (shouts)  Jaqen: If a girl tells me her name,  I will give her eyes back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  A girl has no name.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Come.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If a girl is truly no one,  she has nothing to fear.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Who are you?  No one.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (horse whinnies)  The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Famously loyal to the Starks.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And you, Lord Karstark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they?  But here we are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Times change.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  When my father became Warden of the North,  your house refused to pledge their banners.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Your father was a cunt.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My beloved father, the Warden--  Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I might have done the same to my father  if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My father was poisoned by our enemies.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Mmm.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?  The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  We're farther north than any of you fuckers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I like fighting wildlings.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 Been doing it all my life.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  So now you've come seeking help?  We need to help each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The colder it gets, the farther south those goat fuckers will roam.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Won't take them long to get here.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?  If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  He knows this place better than we ever will.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Pledge your banners to House Bolton.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North  and we will fight together to destroy the bastard  and all his wildling friends.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'm not kissing your fucking hand.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'm not doing that either.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?  Your father honored tradition.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Knelt for Robb Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Called him King of the North.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?  Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I've got a gift for you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  A girl, I hope.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	 I prefer redheads.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  A girl, aye.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (laughing)  A wild one.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I like them wild.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  And the boy, nice and young.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  The way Karstark likes them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Who's this?  Rickon Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  How do I know that's Rickon Stark?  Welcome home, Lord Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (pounding on door)  It's time.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If you have any last words, now is the time.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You shouldn't be alive.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  It's not right.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Neither was killing me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My mother's still living at White Harbor.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Could you write her?  Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I had a choice, Lord Commander.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You brought an army of wildlings into our lands.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  An army of murderers and raiders.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up,  I pray I'd make the right choice again.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  I fought, I lost.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Now I rest.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  But you, Lord Snow,  you'll be fighting their battles forever.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  (choking, gasping)  We should burn the bodies.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You should.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  What do you want me to do with this?  Wear it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Burn it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  Whatever you want.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  You have Castle Black.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	  My watch is ended.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	1 ( theme music playing )  Game of Thrones 6x04  Book of the Stranger  @elderman  ( wind howling )  - ( distant man shouting ) - ( metal clanging )  ( rustling, chair scrapes )  Where you gonna go?  South.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What are you gonna do?  Get warm.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I was with you at Hardhome.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We saw what's out there.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We know it's coming here.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  How can you leave us now?  I did everything I could.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 You know that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You swore a vow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - I gave my life.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - For all nights to come.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They killed me, Edd! My own brothers.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You want me to stay here after that?  - ( horn blowing ) - Man: Riders approaching!  Man #2: Open the gate!  ( people murmuring )  This is good soup.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?  - With the peas and onions? - Mmm.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We never should have left Winterfell.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left?  I want to scream at myself, "Don't go, you idiot.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	"  How could we know?  I spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass I was to you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I wish I could change everything.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We were children.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I was awful, just admit it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( chuckles )  You were occasionally awful.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm sure I can't have been great fun.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - Can you forgive me? - There's nothing to forgive.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - Forgive me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - All right.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  All right, I forgive you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( laughs )  - ( coughing ) - ( laughs )  You'd think after thousands of years,  the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Where will you go?  Where will we go?  If I don't watch over you,  Father's ghost will come back and murder me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Where will we go?  I can't stay here, not after what happened.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  There's only one place we can go.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Home.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?  We'll take it back from them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I don't have an army.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  How many wildlings did you save?  They didn't come here to serve me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They owe you their lives.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?  - Sansa.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - Winterfell is our home.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Wherever they are, it belongs to our family.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We have to fight for it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm tired of fighting.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It's all I've done since I left home.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I've killed wildlings.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 I've killed men that I admire.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I hanged a boy younger than Bran.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I fought and I lost.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I want you to help me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But I'll do it myself if I have to.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  My lady.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Ser Davos.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Will you stay here at Castle Black?  I will do as Jon Snow commands.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You serve Jon Snow now?  He's the prince that was promised.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What happened down there?  There was a battle.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Stannis was defeated.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And Shireen?  What happened to the princess?  I saw what happened.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We've met before.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That's in the past now.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Yes, it's in the past.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It doesn't mean I forget.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Or forgive.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He admitted it, you know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Who did?  Stannis.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Just before I executed him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( sighs )  ( horses approaching )  ( horse whinnies )  The Defender of the Vale!  Uncle Petyr!  My lord.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Come and see.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I missed your name day.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Go on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - ( screeches ) - ( gasps ) A falcon!  A gyrfalcon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The greatest and rarest of birds.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Last time I saw you, Baelish,  you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Indeed I was.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And yet not long ago, we received reports  that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  On our way to the Fingers,  we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Seemed to know exactly when  we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Do you take me for a fool?  Tell me, Lord Royce,  how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?  I shared my intentions with you  and no one else.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Slander a man in his own home,  you might find yourself crossing swords with him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Your home is the Vale.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 The Lord of the Vale stands before us.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And only his judgment concerns me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Robin: Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?  My lord.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  To your father, to your mother, and now to you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?  ( screeches )  Lord Royce has served the Vale well.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He's enjoyed a distinguished military career.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  If we could trust his absolute loyalty,  he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I think he deserves one more chance.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 What do you say?  Fine.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I bring good news.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I expect she's headed to Castle Black  where her brother serves as Lord Commander.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( sighs )  She's my cousin.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We should help her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That was my instinct as well.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Our lord has spoken.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Gather the Knights of the Vale.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The time has come to join the fray.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( birds screeching )  Grey Worm: You invite the enemy into our city?  I did.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  As a clever man once told me,  "We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	"  Grey Worm: I don't make peace with the queen's enemies.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I kill the queen's enemies.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Yes, that's the military approach.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And how has that worked here in Meereen?  I represent the diplomatic approach.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters  and they tried to murder her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We enter these negotiations with open eyes.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Trust me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 My own recent experience with slavery  has taught me the horrors of that institution.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  How many days were you a slave?  ( stammers ) Long enough to know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Not long enough to understand.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And somehow you've risen  to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It's most impressive.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Here's to reversals of fortune.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We came here to meet the queen  and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Her path takes her westward.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  When we last met, I offered her ships  so she could return to Westeros where she belongs.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 She refused them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  She refused them because hundreds of thousands  of men, women, and children still lived in chains.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  As they have since the dawn of time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - Not anymore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - You think you're a free man now?  You still follow orders.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Just because your master has silver hair and tits  doesn't mean she's not a master.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Friends, friends, friends, please.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  There have always been  those with wealth and power and those with nothing.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That is the way of the world.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm not here to change the way of the world.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Slavery is the way of our world.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You don't need slaves to make money.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years  and I grew up richer than any of you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But our queen recognizes that she erred  by abolishing slavery  without providing a new system to replace it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  So here is the queen's proposal.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Slavery will never return to Meereen,  but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay  time to adjust to the new order.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What does that mean?  Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,  we will give you seven years to end the practice.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Slaveholders will be compensated  for their losses, of course, at fair prices.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  In exchange, you will cut off  your support for the Sons of the Harpy.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I do hope you accept, my friends.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You will not receive a better offer.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( rings bell )  Let us sail on the tide of freedom  instead of being drowned by it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And as a parting gift to our honored guests  Give freedom a chance.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( whispering in Valyrian )  ( Tyrion speaking Valyrian )  Perhaps I should translate for you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Man: We speak the Common Tongue.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - Excellent.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - You met with the slavers today.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Tyrion: I did.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I imagine this room was built  so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But I am not your ruler.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm not the Breaker of Chains.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm not the Unburnt.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You are a stranger here.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?  Because our queen chose me as her advisor.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Until she returns from her travels--  When does she return?  Soon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 You have my word.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We don't know you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 We don't trust you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 We know Torgo Nudho.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We fight with him against the Masters.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 We trust him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  As commander of the Unsullied, he knows how to defeat the slavers  and he knows when it is time to make peace.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You have made peace with the slavers?  Tyrion: We offered terms.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( speaking Valyrian )  - Do not use me for your lies.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - Those men respect you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They respect me because they know who I am.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - They know I am loyal.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - As do I.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I am loyal to my queen, not you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  If you betray her work, you are my enemy.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I am not betraying her work.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 I am trying to save her city.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  For a short time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You're right.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  War is a horror that should be ended at once.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I can't do both today.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You are wrong to trust these men.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I don't trust the Masters.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 I trust their self-interest.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They're trustworthy if they're convinced  that working with me is in their self-interest.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You don't know them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 You don't understand them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We are not human in their eyes.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They look at me and see a weapon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They look at her and see a whore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Their contempt is their weakness.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You will not use them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They will use you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 That is what they do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( bird screeching )  ( breathing heavily )  You all right?  Why don't you sit and catch your breath?  - I'm fine.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - ( chuckles )  I don't think you could ride the dragon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  20 years ago, maybe.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - What? - Our queen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  She's wild, you know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Don't let her size fool you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You, I don't think your heart could take it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Must make you angry that our queen chose me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Makes me sad.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 You'll disappoint her before long.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - She'll move on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - We'll all disappoint her before long.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We need each other right now.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 After we're done needing each other--  Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What do I have to gain?  If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?  None.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The road running through the Horse Gate,  they call that the godsway.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Eastern Market, Western Market.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  When Khal Drogo died,  she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,  the widows of the dead khals.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That's where they would have taken her,  the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What are you doing?  It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?  If they spot us and we're unarmed,  we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But if they see weapons  You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  There's 100,000 of them down there.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We can't fight our way out.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We wait till dark, and then we'll find her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Uh  I'm very attached to this knife.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Don't worry.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 It didn't touch you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You know what happens?  I know what happens.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'll do it myself.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - ( drum music playing ) - ( chatter )  ( moaning )  I should have been born a Dothraki.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( men speaking Dothraki )  - Come on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - ( continues in Dothraki )  ( speaking Dothraki )  ( grunting )  ( shouts )  ( shouting in Dothraki )  ( bone cracks )  ( choking )  ( squelches )  ( gasping )  Told you, I'm very attached to this knife.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You all right?  If they find a body with a stab wound,  the whole city will be looking for us.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( grunting )  ( thuds )  Huh.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( women speaking Dothraki )  Mm-hmm.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - No, don't hurt her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - She'll give us away.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We have to go now.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( whimpering )  We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  All we can do is try.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  No.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We can do more than that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And you're going to help me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( speaking Dothraki )  If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go?  - ( door closes ) - What would you seek out?  I'd go to my brother,  my husband, my family.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money,  finery, power.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Seeking out your family means seeking out sin.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm not maligning you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I sought those things out, too.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  To the exclusion of all else.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  My father was a cobbler.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He died when I was young and I took over his shop.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He was a simple man and he made simple shoes.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But I found that the more work I put into my shoes,  the more people wanted them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Fine leather, ornamentation,  detailing, and time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Time most of all.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Quality takes time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( chuckles ) Yes.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I imagine you've worn a year  of someone's life on your back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time  and they paid well for the privilege.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I used their money  to buy a taste of their lives for myself.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Each time I indulged,  I felt myself ascending to something better.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And one day you walked through a graveyard  and realized it was all for nothing  and set out on the path to righteousness.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Book of the Stranger, verse 25.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You know "The Seven-Pointed Star.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	"  Septa Unella reads it to me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 At me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You're close.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But it wasn't a graveyard.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It was a feast.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I bought old fine wine  and young pretty girls  and invited my friends to come and share it all.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We passed around the wine, passed around the women,  and soon we fell into a stupor.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I woke before dawn.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I could barely stand.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor,  lying in heaps next to their fine clothes.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The truth of their bodies laid bare.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I could smell them  beneath the incense and the perfume  and the fine food that had already started to turn.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And I saw it with perfect clarity.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I saw what my sins were.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used,  my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It was all part of a story.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  A story I was telling myself about who I was.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  A collection of lies  that would disappear in the light.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The people I was trying to climb away from,  the beggars in the street,  the poor,  they were closer to the truth than I ever was.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  So what did you do?  I left to go and find them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I didn't even put on my shoes.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I walked out the door and never went back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Come, let's go and see him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - Who? - Your brother.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( door locks )  Loras.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Loras.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( sobbing )  Listen to me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You need to stay strong.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I can't stay strong.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I never was strong.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You are strong.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You are the future of our house,  the future of our family.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - I don't care about that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - Shh!  Shh.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Have you-- have you told them that?  That you don't care?  I just want it to stop.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Help me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( sobbing )  They want me to help you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They want me to help tear you down.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They want me to help tear you down.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That's why he's letting me see you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 I know it is.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Let them win.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Just make it stop.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Please.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - ( sobbing ) - All right.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Pycelle: And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  This High Sparrow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Not setting them off, that's the most important thing.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You are beset with enemies both within and without.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What are you doing here?  I am advising the king on our current predicament.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Leave.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I am a member of the small council.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The king--  Is this a small council meeting?  Obviously not.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That will be all for now.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Your Grace.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Since I've missed the past several small council meetings,  I wanted to speak to you about a few things.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  As have we all, unfortunately.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We need to be careful in dealing with such a man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  To prevent things from escalating any further.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We have to be careful not to antagonize him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He has Margaery.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 We can't put her at risk.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - He's dangerous.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - Look at me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What did they do to me?  To the king's own mother?  It's all right.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It's done.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 It's in the past.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And of course  Margaery's safety is paramount.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You don't like Margaery, do you?  Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Margaery is the queen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Queens must command respect.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Kings even more so.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  No respect for anything in this world.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He has no use for the things of this world.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?  With fantasies.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  With beggars in the street.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  With nothing.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Mother  there's something I want to tell you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Something the High Sparrow told me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You've spoken with him?  I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 If he found out I told--  It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly  given his constant prattling about the truth.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I am your mother.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You can always trust me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( door opens )  The small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You're not welcome.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You once spoke of your respect for our father  because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority,  publically shamed, and confined to the Red Keep.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( chuckles ) What's left to work with?  Jaime: Cersei is the mother of the king.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  She has the king's ear and his trust.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And the king has been speaking regularly  with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The High Sparrow seized power  knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves  instead of seizing it back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Here we are.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Well done to us.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms  rests in his dirty peasant hands.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Yes, Margaery will repent her sins  before the good people of the city.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Oh, no.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That cannot happen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That will not happen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I agree.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You've got the second largest army in Westeros.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You'll bring them into the city,  stop Queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts,  and take her back into Crown custody.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow  or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You will take no action at all.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?  No, but if the king should call--  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably,  and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,  do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?  You hate these fanatics as much as we do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You hate what they've done to your son.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Do you want Lancel back?  Or have you given him up for good?  Of course I want him back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Then stand aside  and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  If it doesn't go as planned,  the sparrows have many friends in this city.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We'll have civil war.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Many will die.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Many will die no matter what we do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Better them than us.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( chatter )  ( fire crackling )  They told me you were home and I didn't believe it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  "Theon Greyjoy?" I said.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  "He's dead.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He's been dead a long time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	"  He let you go?  I escaped.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I can't hear you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I escaped.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Look at me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Look at me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Men died trying to rescue you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Good men.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  My men.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm sorry.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You were my brother.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You were a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother  and I risked everything for you  and you betrayed me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 I know and I'm sorry.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Stop saying that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He broke me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He broke me into 1,000 pieces.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - I know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - You don't know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He sent us one of those pieces.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That's why I came for you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( sobbing )  Why did you come here?  Where else could I go?  You heard Father was dead and you thought you'd claim the crown?  No, no.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 I only heard he died after we docked.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You happen to show up on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?  I didn't know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You think any ironborn wants you to be king  after what you've done?  I don't want to be king.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  What do you want?  I should have listened to you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 You're the only one--  That doesn't matter anymore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Stop crying.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Look at me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Tell me what you want.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You should rule the Iron Islands.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Let me help you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They've cleaned you up nicely.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You know who I am?  A lord.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Yes.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  A lord.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You've seen my banners?  The flayed man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Does that worry you at all?  You eat them after?  ( chuckles )  No.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( scoffs ) Then I've seen worse.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You served the Starks?  Aye.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 They put me in chains  and put a sword at my throat,  so I served them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The Starks have been gone for a long time,  but you kept protecting Rickon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I served his family a long time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Didn't get no wages.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Way I see it, I'm owed.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Be that as it may,  Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He's mine.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  So what use could I possibly have for you?  ( scoffs )  I can give you what you want.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And you're sure you know what that is?  Same thing men always want.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( moans )  You're a good talker.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I like that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That so?  I had to work hard to get him talking.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  But he talked.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  They all do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  He told me everything.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  All about the Stark boys,  who helped them escape,  and how she did it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( sighs )  Man: Open the gate!  Sorry about the food.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It's not what we're known for.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  That's all right.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 There are more important things.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( door opens )  A letter for you, Lord Commander.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  "To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You have betrayed your own kind.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You have betrayed the North.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Winterfell is mine, bastard.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Come and see.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  His direwolf's skin is on my floor.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Come and see.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 I want my bride back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Send her to me, bastard,  and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter  every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You will watch as I skin them living.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You--"  Go on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  It's just more of the same.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  "You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You will watch as my dogs  devour your wild little brother.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Come and see.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell  and Warden of the North.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	"  Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  His father's dead.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Ramsay killed him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  - And now he has Rickon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 - We don't know that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Yes, we do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  How many men does he have in his army?  I heard him say 5,000  once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  How many do you have?  That can march and fight?  2,000.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  The rest are children and old people.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  You're the son of the last true Warden of the North.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  Northern families are loyal.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	 They'll fight for you if you ask.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  A monster has taken our home and our brother.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	  ( speaking Dothraki )  ( door opens )  ( door closes )  ( laughs )  ( laughing )  ( shouting )  ( screams )  ( Dothraki screaming )  ( screaming )  ( music playing )  @elderman
s06e05	The Door	(theme music playing)   (knock at door)  - Sansa: Yes? - (door opens)  For you, my lady.
s06e05	The Door	  How far is Mole's Town?  (footsteps)  Sansa.
s06e05	The Door	  Lady Brienne.
s06e05	The Door	  When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.
s06e05	The Door	  You have no idea how happy I am  to see you unharmed.
s06e05	The Door	  Unharmed?  What are you doing here?  I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid.
s06e05	The Door	  They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
s06e05	The Door	  To come to my aid?  Did you know about Ramsay?  If you didn't know, you're an idiot.
s06e05	The Door	  If you did know, you're my enemy.
s06e05	The Door	  Would you like to hear about our wedding night?  He never hurt my face.
s06e05	The Door	  He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter.
s06e05	The Door	  But the rest of me,  he did what he liked with the rest of me  as long as I could still give him an heir.
s06e05	The Door	  What do you think he did?  I can't begin to contemplate--  What do you think he did to me?  Lady Sansa asked you a question.
s06e05	The Door	  He beat you.
s06e05	The Door	  Yes, he enjoyed that.
s06e05	The Door	  What else do you think he did?  - Sansa, I-- - What else?  Did he cut you?  - Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
s06e05	The Door	 - I didn't know.
s06e05	The Door	  I thought you knew everyone's secrets.
s06e05	The Door	  I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.
s06e05	The Door	  I underestimated a stranger.
s06e05	The Door	  The other things he did,  ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things,  but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.
s06e05	The Door	  I can still feel it.
s06e05	The Door	  I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.
s06e05	The Door	  I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.
s06e05	The Door	  I'm so sorry.
s06e05	The Door	  You said you would protect me.
s06e05	The Door	  And I will.
s06e05	The Door	 You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
s06e05	The Door	  I don't believe you anymore.
s06e05	The Door	 I don't need you anymore.
s06e05	The Door	  You can't protect me.
s06e05	The Door	  You won't even be able to protect yourself  if I tell Brienne to cut you down.
s06e05	The Door	  And why shouldn't I?  Do you want me to beg for my life?  If that's what you want, I will.
s06e05	The Door	  Whatever you ask that is in my power,  I will do.
s06e05	The Door	  What if I want you to die here and now?  Then I will die.
s06e05	The Door	  You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family  and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family.
s06e05	The Door	  Go back to Moat Cailin.
s06e05	The Door	  My brother and I will take back the North on our own.
s06e05	The Door	  I never want to see you again.
s06e05	The Door	  I would do anything to undo what's been done to you.
s06e05	The Door	  I know that I can't.
s06e05	The Door	  Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go?  Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish  has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.
s06e05	The Door	  You might consider seeking him out.
s06e05	The Door	  The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
s06e05	The Door	  I have an army.
s06e05	The Door	  Your brother's army.
s06e05	The Door	  Half-brother.
s06e05	The Door	  (staves clacking)  (grunting)  You're not ready.
s06e05	The Door	  You should go home before it's too late.
s06e05	The Door	  (grunts)  (grunts)  (grunts)  You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.
s06e05	The Door	  She has a point.
s06e05	The Door	  None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies.
s06e05	The Door	  They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
s06e05	The Door	  Who was the first?  He was no one.
s06e05	The Door	  The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face  and how to give the gift.
s06e05	The Door	  The man taught others in exchange for their service.
s06e05	The Door	  Many served, many more gifts were given.
s06e05	The Door	  Soon all the masters and overseers were gone  and the Faceless Men fled.
s06e05	The Door	  Where did they go?  Here.
s06e05	The Door	  They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house.
s06e05	The Door	  These were the faces they wore in life  when they were not wearing others.
s06e05	The Door	  The first Faceless Men.
s06e05	The Door	  And now a girl is one of them,  if a girl desires.
s06e05	The Door	  A girl has no desires.
s06e05	The Door	  Who?  An actress who calls herself Lady Crane.
s06e05	The Door	  She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square.
s06e05	The Door	  A girl has been given a second chance.
s06e05	The Door	  There will not be a third.
s06e05	The Door	  One way or another,  a face will be added to the hall.
s06e05	The Door	  (applause)  (horn blows)  (crowd laughs)  - (farts) - Ahh!  Oh, murdered by a boar.
s06e05	The Door	  The great big hairy whore.
s06e05	The Door	  He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts  and soon I am no more.
s06e05	The Door	  Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie.
s06e05	The Door	  I love you, Father.
s06e05	The Door	 Please don't die.
s06e05	The Door	  - Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.
s06e05	The Door	 - (laughs)  I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land.
s06e05	The Door	  And our son alone on that cold, cold throne  without a guiding hand.
s06e05	The Door	  Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace?  To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?  Ned Stark will do fine.
s06e05	The Door	 Now bring me more wine.
s06e05	The Door	  - (crowd laughs) - (footsteps)  Ooh!  Ooh, what's happened here, then?  He brought you here, Ned Stark,  'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land.
s06e05	The Door	  You should be king of us all  and I should be your Hand.
s06e05	The Door	  We men of the North are right good hands  at keeping people lawful.
s06e05	The Door	  I'd ask him for permission,  but he smells too bloody awful.
s06e05	The Door	  - (screams) - (crowd laughs)  I die! I die!  And here I now must lie.
s06e05	The Door	  Oh, woe.
s06e05	The Door	 Oh, no.
s06e05	The Door	  - (farts) - (laughing)  Oh, I am about to go.
s06e05	The Door	  (farting)  Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?  The Iron Throne's what I demand.
s06e05	The Door	  - You cannot.
s06e05	The Door	 - I can.
s06e05	The Door	  - You will not.
s06e05	The Door	 - I will.
s06e05	The Door	  - You dare not.
s06e05	The Door	 - I dare yes.
s06e05	The Door	  - The line of succession.
s06e05	The Door	 - What's that mean?  - The proper progression.
s06e05	The Door	 - What's that mean?  - The lawful ascension.
s06e05	The Door	 - What's that mean?  (laughing)  - (music playing) - (cheering)  So move along, give me my chair  and there won't be no more trouble.
s06e05	The Door	  - (grunts) - (crowd laughs)  But we had a deal all done and dusted.
s06e05	The Door	  I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.
s06e05	The Door	  (laughter, applause)  Save my father.
s06e05	The Door	  Truly you should.
s06e05	The Door	 Killing the man will do you no good.
s06e05	The Door	  - Save him, please.
s06e05	The Door	 - Show him mercy.
s06e05	The Door	  Show the people what a good king should be.
s06e05	The Door	  Good people, you may all relax.
s06e05	The Door	  My father's friend shall be spared the--  - (audience gasps) - (gasps)  - (music playing) - Sansa actor: Father! No!  Oh, Father.
s06e05	The Door	 Oh!  (laughter)  Tyrion actor: Worry not!  All is well.
s06e05	The Door	  I have here a decree  from my father Tywin Lannister,  the richest man you'll see.
s06e05	The Door	  He proclaims me Hand of the King.
s06e05	The Door	  The position's mine for life.
s06e05	The Door	  And he's given me permission to take  Sansa as my wife.
s06e05	The Door	  - (screams) - (crowd booing)  You'll learn that what I lack in height,  - I make up for in appetite.
s06e05	The Door	 - (screams)  So let's forget about your plight,  and go rehearse our wedding night.
s06e05	The Door	  - (music playing) - (applause)  It's a wart.
s06e05	The Door	 Two warts.
s06e05	The Door	  I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
s06e05	The Door	  Well, don't worry, love.
s06e05	The Door	 They usually go away in five or six years.
s06e05	The Door	  Oh, wash this, darling.
s06e05	The Door	 It stinks of me.
s06e05	The Door	  You can do better, Bianca, dear.
s06e05	The Door	 You must do.
s06e05	The Door	  I had two lines.
s06e05	The Door	  There are no small parts.
s06e05	The Door	 You rang very false.
s06e05	The Door	  I rang very false?  What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.
s06e05	The Door	  (laughs)  Bianca: You weren't complaining about me last night.
s06e05	The Door	  Tyrion actor: May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?  Lady Crane: I'm a rum girl, Bobono.
s06e05	The Door	  You need to know that if we're going to be intimate.
s06e05	The Door	  Of course we're going to be intimate.
s06e05	The Door	  It's only a matter of time.
s06e05	The Door	  (rum pouring)  To our children.
s06e05	The Door	  May they have your talent.
s06e05	The Door	  And your filthy mind.
s06e05	The Door	  (chuckles)  A girl will poison the rum.
s06e05	The Door	  Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
s06e05	The Door	  If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall  A girl is not ready.
s06e05	The Door	  She's a good actress.
s06e05	The Door	  So a man has heard.
s06e05	The Door	  Seems like a decent woman.
s06e05	The Door	  Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?  No.
s06e05	The Door	  Who wants her dead?  That does not matter.
s06e05	The Door	 The price was paid.
s06e05	The Door	  The younger actress.
s06e05	The Door	  She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
s06e05	The Door	  A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
s06e05	The Door	  A girl has decided.
s06e05	The Door	  A servant does not ask questions.
s06e05	The Door	  (raven cawing)  (ravens cawing)  (voices whispering)  - (raven caws) - (whispering continues)  (whispering)  (breathing heavily)  No! No! No!  (screaming)  (screaming stops)  (ice crackling)  (gasps)  It was you.
s06e05	The Door	  You made the white walkers.
s06e05	The Door	  We were at war.
s06e05	The Door	  We were being slaughtered.
s06e05	The Door	  Our sacred trees cut down.
s06e05	The Door	  We needed to defend ourselves.
s06e05	The Door	  From whom?  From you.
s06e05	The Door	  From men.
s06e05	The Door	  Aeron: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God.
s06e05	The Door	  In his name we gather today  to choose a new king as our leader.
s06e05	The Door	  Who makes a claim?  I am Yara Greyjoy,  daughter of Balon Greyjoy,  King of the Iron Islands.
s06e05	The Door	  I claim the Salt Throne.
s06e05	The Door	  We've never had a queen.
s06e05	The Door	 Not once.
s06e05	The Door	  There are many things we've never done.
s06e05	The Door	  We've never made our mark upon the world.
s06e05	The Door	  The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind  until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms  long enough to become a nuisance.
s06e05	The Door	  Then they swat us down.
s06e05	The Door	  They conquer us, humiliate us,  and go right back to forgetting we exist.
s06e05	The Door	  Men: Aye!  - We are a sea people.
s06e05	The Door	 - Aye!  - Our god is a sea god.
s06e05	The Door	 - Aye!  When I am queen, we will build a fleet that--  - You shall not be queen! - I am not finished!  Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us.
s06e05	The Door	  Not when Balon's own male heir has returned.
s06e05	The Door	  I am Theon Greyjoy  last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
s06e05	The Door	  And she is your rightful ruler.
s06e05	The Door	  Men: Aye!  Those of you that have sailed under her,  and there are many of you here,  - you know what she is.
s06e05	The Door	 - Aye!  - She is a reaver.
s06e05	The Door	 - Aye!  - She is a warrior.
s06e05	The Door	 - Aye!  She is ironborn!  Aye!  We will find no better leader.
s06e05	The Door	  This is our queen.
s06e05	The Door	  (men cheering)  (men chanting) Yara! Yara! Yara!  I'm Euron Greyjoy.
s06e05	The Door	  I claim the Salt Throne.
s06e05	The Door	  (men murmuring)  Niece.
s06e05	The Door	  Nephew.
s06e05	The Door	  Little Theon.
s06e05	The Door	  Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground.
s06e05	The Door	  (men chuckle)  Captured a castle you couldn't keep.
s06e05	The Door	  Got yourself taken prisoner.
s06e05	The Door	  Even heard you have no cock.
s06e05	The Door	  (men laugh)  Explains why you think a woman can be king.
s06e05	The Door	  When did you return, Uncle?  A few days ago.
s06e05	The Door	  I had some things to take care of.
s06e05	The Door	  Long overdue.
s06e05	The Door	  I'm glad you're here.
s06e05	The Door	  Now I know what my first act as queen will be.
s06e05	The Door	  To execute the man who killed my father.
s06e05	The Door	  (men murmuring)  I did.
s06e05	The Door	  I killed him.
s06e05	The Door	  Threw him right over a rope bridge  and watched him fall.
s06e05	The Door	  He was leading us nowhere  and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me.
s06e05	The Door	  No one loved him.
s06e05	The Door	 No one wanted to follow him.
s06e05	The Door	  He led us into two wars we couldn't win.
s06e05	The Door	  I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
s06e05	The Door	  That would have been hard to do.
s06e05	The Door	  You weren't here.
s06e05	The Door	  Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.
s06e05	The Door	  Gallivanting?  That the sort of thing you start to say  - once your dick gets chopped off? - (men laugh)  Did the great lords of Westeros teach you words like that?  You were gone.
s06e05	The Door	  Yara was here.
s06e05	The Door	  Being ironborn.
s06e05	The Door	 Leading ironborn.
s06e05	The Door	  Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
s06e05	The Door	  Euron: And how will she do that?  I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
s06e05	The Door	  Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet  because I'm the one who knows how to use it.
s06e05	The Door	  I've been all over the world.
s06e05	The Door	  I've seen more of it than all of you combined.
s06e05	The Door	  And across the sea there is a person  who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.
s06e05	The Door	  Someone with a large army,  three large dragons, and no husband.
s06e05	The Door	  I'm going to build that fleet  and I'm going to gallivant right over  and give it to Daenerys Targaryen  - along with my big cock.
s06e05	The Door	 - (men laugh)  You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?  I'm not going to seduce her.
s06e05	The Door	 The Iron Fleet will seduce her.
s06e05	The Door	  And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e05	The Door	  I wasn't born to be king.
s06e05	The Door	  I paid the iron price  and here I stand.
s06e05	The Door	  (cheering)  (men chanting) Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!  Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!  Euron! Euron!  May Euron, your servant, be born again  from the sea as you were.
s06e05	The Door	  Bless him with salt.
s06e05	The Door	 Bless him with stone.
s06e05	The Door	  Bless him with steel.
s06e05	The Door	  Listen to the waves.
s06e05	The Door	 Listen to the god.
s06e05	The Door	  He is speaking to us and he says  we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.
s06e05	The Door	  Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away.
s06e05	The Door	  Let the old Euron drown.
s06e05	The Door	  Let his lungs fill with seawater.
s06e05	The Door	  Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
s06e05	The Door	  What is dead may never die,  but rises again harder and stronger.
s06e05	The Door	  (gagging, coughing)  (gasping)  What is dead may never die.
s06e05	The Door	  All: What is dead may never die.
s06e05	The Door	  (cheers)  Where are my niece and nephew?  Let's go murder them.
s06e05	The Door	  Aeron: They stole our best ships.
s06e05	The Door	  Won't be enough to save them.
s06e05	The Door	  Go back to your homes.
s06e05	The Door	  Chop down every tree you can find.
s06e05	The Door	  Quarter-saw the timber and start building.
s06e05	The Door	  I want every man bending planks.
s06e05	The Door	  I want every woman spinning flax for sails.
s06e05	The Door	  Build me a thousand ships  and I will give you this world.
s06e05	The Door	  I banished you twice.
s06e05	The Door	  You came back twice.
s06e05	The Door	  And you saved my life.
s06e05	The Door	  So I can't take you back  and I can't send you away.
s06e05	The Door	  You must send me away.
s06e05	The Door	  Is there a cure?  I don't know.
s06e05	The Door	  How long does it take?  I don't know that either.
s06e05	The Door	  But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough.
s06e05	The Door	  I'll end things before that.
s06e05	The Door	  I'm sorry.
s06e05	The Door	  I'm so sorry.
s06e05	The Door	  Don't be.
s06e05	The Door	  All I've ever wanted was to serve you.
s06e05	The Door	  Tyrion Lannister was right.
s06e05	The Door	  I love you.
s06e05	The Door	  I'll always love you.
s06e05	The Door	  Good-bye, khaleesi.
s06e05	The Door	  Do not walk away from your queen,  Jorah the Andal.
s06e05	The Door	  You have not been dismissed.
s06e05	The Door	  You pledged yourself to me.
s06e05	The Door	  You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
s06e05	The Door	  Well, I command you to find the cure  wherever it is in this world.
s06e05	The Door	  I command you to heal yourself  and then return to me.
s06e05	The Door	  When I take the Seven Kingdoms,  I need you by my side.
s06e05	The Door	  In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters,  how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?  None.
s06e05	The Door	  And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men?  Two, but that was the day of the pact.
s06e05	The Door	  Since then, nothing.
s06e05	The Door	  So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
s06e05	The Door	  For now.
s06e05	The Door	  For now is the best we get in our profession.
s06e05	The Door	  It's not enough.
s06e05	The Door	  Considering the city was on the brink of civil war,  I'd say it's a good start.
s06e05	The Door	  It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.
s06e05	The Door	  They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.
s06e05	The Door	  The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.
s06e05	The Door	  Resist the foreign invaders.
s06e05	The Door	  Our queen has an even better story.
s06e05	The Door	  Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.
s06e05	The Door	  The people know who brought them freedom.
s06e05	The Door	  Yes, but do they know who brought them security?  Who brought about an end to the violence?  We need someone the people trust,  someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.
s06e05	The Door	  Sounds like quite the hero.
s06e05	The Door	 Where would we find him?  Who said anything about "him"?              That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
s06e05	The Door	  Thank you for travelling all this way.
s06e05	The Door	  I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
s06e05	The Door	  The truth is we need your help.
s06e05	The Door	  We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to--  You don't need to persuade me.
s06e05	The Door	  I came to help.
s06e05	The Door	  Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised.
s06e05	The Door	  From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
s06e05	The Door	  Yes.
s06e05	The Door	  She has freed the slaves from their chains  and crucified the Masters for their sins.
s06e05	The Door	  She did indeed.
s06e05	The Door	  Her dragons are fire made flesh,  a gift from the Lord of Light.
s06e05	The Door	  But you heard all of this before, haven't you?  On the Long Bridge of Volantis.
s06e05	The Door	  The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands,  burning their sins and flesh away.
s06e05	The Door	  Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers.
s06e05	The Door	  The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
s06e05	The Door	  You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed.
s06e05	The Door	  And while she's gone, you want her advisors  to be worshipped and obeyed.
s06e05	The Door	  I'd settle for obeyed.
s06e05	The Door	  I will summon my most eloquent priests.
s06e05	The Door	  They will spread the word.
s06e05	The Door	  Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness  in this war and in the great war still to come.
s06e05	The Door	  That sounds most excellent.
s06e05	The Door	  A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed  as the chosen one by one of your priestesses.
s06e05	The Door	  He, too, had a glorious destiny.
s06e05	The Door	  He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated  by the man standing beside me.
s06e05	The Door	  Last I had heard, he had been defeated again,  this time at Winterfell and this time for good.
s06e05	The Door	  We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
s06e05	The Door	  I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake.
s06e05	The Door	  Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic?  You're always right.
s06e05	The Door	  Everything is the Lord's will.
s06e05	The Door	  Everything is the Lord's will.
s06e05	The Door	  But men and women make mistakes.
s06e05	The Door	  Even honest servants of the Lord.
s06e05	The Door	  And you, an honest servant of the Lord,  why should I trust you to know any more  than the priestess who counseled Stannis?  My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,  but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.
s06e05	The Door	  Everyone is what they are  and where they are for a reason.
s06e05	The Door	  Terrible things happen for a reason.
s06e05	The Door	  Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child.
s06e05	The Door	  If not for your mutilation  at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,  you wouldn't be here helping the Lord's Chosen  bring his light into the world.
s06e05	The Door	  Knowledge has made you powerful.
s06e05	The Door	  But there's still so much you don't know.
s06e05	The Door	  Do you remember what you heard that night  when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire?  You heard a voice call out from the flames.
s06e05	The Door	 Do you remember?  Should I tell you what the voice said?  Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?  We serve the same queen.
s06e05	The Door	  If you are her true friend,  you have nothing to fear from me.
s06e05	The Door	  (raven caws)  (wind howling)  What?  (gasps)  (gasps)  (screams)  He saw me, the Night King!  - He saw me! - He touched you.
s06e05	The Door	  I don't know.
s06e05	The Door	 He was close, but--  He touched you.
s06e05	The Door	  He knows you are here.
s06e05	The Door	 He'll come for you.
s06e05	The Door	  But he can't get in.
s06e05	The Door	  He can now.
s06e05	The Door	 His mark is on you.
s06e05	The Door	  You must leave, all of you.
s06e05	The Door	  Meera: Come on, Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Help me with the sledge.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  I'm sorry.
s06e05	The Door	 I didn't mean to.
s06e05	The Door	  - The time has come.
s06e05	The Door	 - The time for what?  For you to become me.
s06e05	The Door	  But am I ready?  No.
s06e05	The Door	  We can't defend the north from the walkers  and the south from the Boltons.
s06e05	The Door	  If we want to survive, we need Winterfell  and to take Winterfell, we need more men.
s06e05	The Door	  Davos: Aside from the Starks and the Boltons,  the most powerful houses in the North  are the Umbers, the Karstarks,  and the Manderlys.
s06e05	The Door	  The Umbers and the Karstarks  have already declared for the Boltons,  so we're not doing so well there.
s06e05	The Door	  The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
s06e05	The Door	 They can hang.
s06e05	The Door	  But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay  without knowing they had another choice.
s06e05	The Door	  I beg your pardon, my lady,  but they know that a Stark beheaded their father.
s06e05	The Door	  I don't think we can count on them either.
s06e05	The Door	  How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?  Precious little, my lady.
s06e05	The Door	  My father always said Northerners are different.
s06e05	The Door	  More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.
s06e05	The Door	  They may well be loyal,  but how many rose up against the Boltons  when they betrayed your family?  I may not know the North, but I know men.
s06e05	The Door	  They're more or less the same in any corner of the world  and even the bravest of them don't want to see  their wives and children skinned for a lost cause.
s06e05	The Door	  If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him,  they need to believe it's a fight they can win.
s06e05	The Door	  There are more than three other houses in the North--  Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,  Mazin, Hornwood.
s06e05	The Door	  Two dozen more.
s06e05	The Door	 Together they equal all the others.
s06e05	The Door	  We can start small and build.
s06e05	The Door	  Sansa: The North remembers.
s06e05	The Door	  They remember the Stark name.
s06e05	The Door	  People will still risk everything for it,  from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.
s06e05	The Door	  I don't doubt it.
s06e05	The Door	  But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
s06e05	The Door	  No, but I do.
s06e05	The Door	  Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son  as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.
s06e05	The Door	  And there are also the Tullys.
s06e05	The Door	 They're not Northern,  but they will back us against the Boltons without question.
s06e05	The Door	  I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
s06e05	The Door	  My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it  and retaken Riverrun.
s06e05	The Door	  How do you know that?  Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
s06e05	The Door	  That's good.
s06e05	The Door	  The Blackfish is a legend.
s06e05	The Door	  His support would mean a great deal.
s06e05	The Door	  Stark, Tully, a few more houses,  almost starts to look like a winning side.
s06e05	The Door	  I've sworn to protect you, my lady.
s06e05	The Door	  You heard them.
s06e05	The Door	 We need more men  and my uncle has an army.
s06e05	The Door	  We can send the Blackfish a raven.
s06e05	The Door	  Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
s06e05	The Door	  It has to be you.
s06e05	The Door	  Ride for Riverrun.
s06e05	The Door	 My uncle will talk to you  and you'll know how to talk to him.
s06e05	The Door	  What is it?  I don't like leaving you here alone.
s06e05	The Door	  With Jon?  Not him.
s06e05	The Door	 He seems trustworthy.
s06e05	The Door	  A bit brooding, perhaps.
s06e05	The Door	  I suppose that's understandable, considering.
s06e05	The Door	  The others, though.
s06e05	The Door	  Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother  with bloodmagic.
s06e05	The Door	  And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they?  Already out looking for a leader with better prospects.
s06e05	The Door	  And that wildling fellow with the beard--  Jon isn't Tormund.
s06e05	The Door	 Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman  or Stannis for that matter.
s06e05	The Door	 Jon is Jon.
s06e05	The Door	  He's my brother.
s06e05	The Door	 He'll keep me safe.
s06e05	The Door	 I trust him.
s06e05	The Door	  Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?  New dress?  I made it myself.
s06e05	The Door	 Do you like it?  Yeah, it's-- I like the wolf bit.
s06e05	The Door	  Good, because I made this for you.
s06e05	The Door	  I made it like the one Father used to wear.
s06e05	The Door	  As near as I can remember.
s06e05	The Door	  Thank you, Sansa.
s06e05	The Door	  You're welcome.
s06e05	The Door	  Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
s06e05	The Door	  I'll do my best.
s06e05	The Door	  Good luck.
s06e05	The Door	  Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?  I'm not the Lord Comman--  yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.
s06e05	The Door	  (raven caws)  Meera: We can go home now, Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Well, maybe not home home,  but somewhere that isn't a cave.
s06e05	The Door	  (chuckles) Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Eat something that isn't moss.
s06e05	The Door	  I want an egg.
s06e05	The Door	 How do you like 'em?  Boiled? Fried up with some butter?  (laughs) Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Get Bran and run!  (white walkers snarling)  Bran.
s06e05	The Door	 Bran, wake up.
s06e05	The Door	  - Bran.
s06e05	The Door	 - Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Bran, wake up.
s06e05	The Door	  - Man: Gods keep you on the kingsroad.
s06e05	The Door	 - Woman: Take it easy.
s06e05	The Door	  Watch yourself.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Help me!  (shouts)  Leaf: Go!  Go!  (shrieking)  Rickard: Remember that you are a Stark.
s06e05	The Door	  Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale  and try to stay out of fights.
s06e05	The Door	  Yes, Father.
s06e05	The Door	  But if you have to fight, win.
s06e05	The Door	  Bran! Bran, wake up!  (snarling)  (grunts)  (branches breaking)  - (screams) - (growls)  Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.
s06e05	The Door	  - Bran! Bran, wake up! - Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  You have to wake up.
s06e05	The Door	  - We need Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 - Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Meera: Bran, we need Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Bran, you have to wake up.
s06e05	The Door	 We need Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  (screaming)  - (shrieks) - Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  (snarling)  Bran, we're all going to die!  Meera: Bran, wake up!  We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!  Bran, you have to wake up.
s06e05	The Door	 We need Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Warg into Hodor now!  Bran, wake up.
s06e05	The Door	 We need Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  We need Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Warg into Hodor now! Now!  Listen to your friend, Brandon.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor: Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	 Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	  (shrieks)  (gasps)  (groans)  (Summer barking)  (growling)  - Summer! - Leaf: Go.
s06e05	The Door	  Go!  (yelping)  (snarling)  Three-Eyed Raven: The time has come.
s06e05	The Door	  Leave me.
s06e05	The Door	  - What are you doing? - Go!  (snarling)  (snarling)  (grunts)  - Hodor, hurry! - (grunts)  Hodor!  Hold the door!  Meera: Hold the door!  Hold the door!  Hold the door!  (thumping)  (wights snarling)  Hold the door!  - Meera: Hold the door! - Nan: Wylis!  What's the matter?  - Hold the door! - Come on, son.
s06e05	The Door	  Hold the door!  - (snarling continues) - (shouts)  (screams)  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door!  Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold door!  Hold door! Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door!  Hold door! Hodor!  Hodor! Hodor!  Hodor! Hodor!  Hodor!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	(theme music playing)   (grunting)  (voices whispering)  (screeches)  (Meera grunting)  (groans)  (panting)  (grunting)  (cawing)  Burn them all!  Where's my sister?  - (groans) - (caws)  Aerys: Burn them all!  (Meera panting)  (shouts, panting)  (grunts)  (sobbing)  (murmuring)  Please.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Aerys: Burn them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Burn them all!  (wights shrieking)  - Aerys: Burn them all! - (Bran screams)  (growling)  Meera.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  They found us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - (growling) - (Meera gasps)  (crying)  I'm so sorry.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (growling)  (whinnies)  (snarling)  (howling)  (whinnies)  Come with me, now.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (growling)  The dead don't rest.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (grunts)  (grunts)  (growling)  (horse whinnies)  It's so green.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, yes.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Once you get south of the Riverlands,  very different sorts of trees start to take over.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Maple, elm, beech, poplar.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The odd willow.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And of course now that summer's over,  you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You're nervous.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 You're a nervous talker.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  That's not any better being a nervous mute.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I didn't think I'd ever come back here  after my father made me renounce my title  and inheritance  and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  So you know what to tell them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  That Little Sam is your baby.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Yes, now that's very important.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild,  he'll take you in.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He'll get an education.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 He'll learn to read.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And you can help teach him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Huh?  What did you tell your family about me?  I told them I met you in the North.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Did you tell them how far north?  Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You didn't tell them where I'm really from?  You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?  The thing is  my father doesn't like wildlings.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He hoped I'd make a man of myself by "killing some bloody wildlings,"  so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I think we're here.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (birds chirping)  Sam.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (laughs) Oh, Sam.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, hello, Mother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I never thought I'd see you again.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - You look wonderful.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - Oh.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 (groans)  Talla?  Gods, you're a woman now.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - He has yellow teeth-- - That's enough, Talla.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, my.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You are lovely.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, and this,  this is our son Samwell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Hello, little one.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 (laughs)  It's me, your grandmother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (laughs)  May I hold him?  Yes, of course.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You have a curious mind, I can tell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You'll be a scholar like your father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Where is Father? And Dickon?  They're on a hunt.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  They'll join us for dinner.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Come inside.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Such a journey.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You must be exhausted.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, and a dress for dinner.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You can wear one of mine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  What's your color?  Midnight blue or silver?  Silver, maybe.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Come.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (pigeons coo, wings flapping)  Is there no other way?  You're afraid for her?  Of course I'm afraid for her!  It just seems very dangerous.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She'll be protected the entire way.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The Faith Militant are very stern  with those who overstep their bounds.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I suspect the gods will predispose the common people  to gentleness on her behalf.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She's truly opened her heart to them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And now she's devoted to the gods as well.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Would you like to see her?  (door opens)  Have they hurt you?  Have they mistreated you?  - No, Your Grace.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - I've missed you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  More than you could know.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We'll be together again soon  and everything will be better than it was before.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Better how?  Soon the--  walk of atonement.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He says there's no other way.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?  Yes, a few times.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Have you?  Yes, I have.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?  (chuckles) You think I'm mad.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I sound mad.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  No.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 No, you don't.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You-- you could never.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You're right, he's not.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He's a lot more--  He is.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  There's something about him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  His way of looking at the world.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's taken me a while.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He's helped me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  What are you talking about?  You're a good person.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 You've always been a good person.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - You're the best person I know.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - (chuckles)  I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Ah, yes, I visited their hovels  and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I never gave them what they really needed, though.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  All those stories I told myself about who I was  and why I did the things I did.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  There were so many lies in those stories.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I don't understand.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's all right.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 It really is.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  What about Loras?  I love my brother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I will always love my brother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  His soul is pure and perfect.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  His sins don't erase that purity,  they only obscure it.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He just needs to atone for them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We all do.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Sooner or later, one way or another.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The gods have a plan for us all.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (footsteps)  It's hard to walk in this.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's beautiful.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You're beautiful.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (sighs)  This venison, it's very tasty.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Is it from today's hunt?  Well, no.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We haven't been able to cure that one yet.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  This is last week's.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, of course.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Sorry.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - Long journey.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - (Dickon chuckles)  Brought it down from 70 yards.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  One shot.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, that's a fair distance.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?  Oh, yes.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Yes.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A good amount.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  North of the Wall,  you don't hunt, you don't eat.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Mm-hmm.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Mostly deer or is it elk as well?  Rabbits.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Sometimes squirrels.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I say "we," it's my friend Jon mostly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Sometimes Edd.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, and Gilly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Um, huntress.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Melessa: I imagine it's common where you're from.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,  who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Talla: Your father taught you to hunt?  Our father would never teach us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  That's enough of that.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Samwell, would you care for more bread?  Oh, yes.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Yes, please.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Thank you, Mother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Not fat enough already?  I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - He wants me to-- - I read your letter.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You're to be a maester.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Yes.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And once I have my chain,  I'll return to Castle Black.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Something resembling a man at least.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You managed to stay soft and fat.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Your nose buried in books.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He can wield a sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He killed a Thenn.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He killed a white walker.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (laughs) There's no such thing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He risked his own life to save mine more than once.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Your way down to Castle Black?  Where did he kill a white walker?  Where are you from?  How'd you come to meet my son?  The Night's Watch came to our keep.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - Where? - Gilly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - North of the Wall.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - North of the Wall?  You're a wildling.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries  and here I sit hosting one in my hall  thanks to my son.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  See that sword?  It's called Heartsbane.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's been in our family for 500 years.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's Valyrian steel.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Only a handful of them left in the world.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  To him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He will never wield that sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,  it would be the end of this house.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you  and I made my peace with that.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Who else would have him?  But I overestimated him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  No.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  This you getting back at me, boy?  Hmm? Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?  And you got what you were after, didn't you?  A bastard.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 A half-breed bastard.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Your invitation into our home.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Come, my dear.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Talla.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I've lost my appetite.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He dishonors us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You dishonor yourself.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Your mother's a fine woman.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 You're not worthy of her.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 She can work in the kitchens.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The bastard will be raised here.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'm not angry at you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'm angry that horrible people  can treat good people that way and get away with it.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  When do you have to go?  First light.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (Little Sam fussing)  (crying)  Say good-bye to him for me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He doesn't know what you are.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Good-bye, Gilly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - Sam? - We're leaving.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - What? - Get your things.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I don't have any things.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - What are you doing? - We belong together.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  All of us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  What about your mother and sister?  Oh, they'll understand.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Your sister's dress.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She won't mind.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Looks better on you anyway.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Sam.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  That's your father's sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's my family's sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (groans)  Sam.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Won't he come for it?  He can bloody well try.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - (music playing) - (crowd cheering)  The lion and the rose are one.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I thank the gods above.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And to you, my beauteous bride,  I pledge undying love.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  All: Hail King Joffrey.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Hail Queen Margaery.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'll drink a toast to my new queen,  for there is no one fairer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?  Drink long and deep, my noble king,  from this cup of sweet wine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The last drink he shall ever take.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And vengeance shall be mine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - (laughs) - (audience booing)  - (gagging) - (audience gasps)  Poison!  Murder!  I gasp.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 I-- I die.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - (Arya laughs) - (gagging)  I limp.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And it was he  - (audience gasps, boos) - that poisoned me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  My evil Uncle Imp.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (laughing)  - (audience booing) - (laughing)  Calm down, dear.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  My firstborn son.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  My golden lion  foully, falsely slain.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I pray you found a lasting peace  free from strife and pain.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Take my life instead.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, woe.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, grief.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (crying)  Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  All hope is lost.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  All joy is gone.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And there is no tomorrow.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (applause)  What is that I hear and smell?  Someone I'll soon send to hell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's time to see if truth they told  who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - (groans) - (audience gasps)  You beast.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 You beast.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  No worse child ever stained this land.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Curse the day I named you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (groaning)  - (farts) - (laughing)  My greatest crime.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Now I must flee.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Then sail across the Narrow Sea  to do unto you more treachery.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Don't fear winter.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Fear me!  - (laughing) - (audience gasps)  (booing)  Izembaro: Thank you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca,  Clarenzo.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - I give you Bobono.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - (booing)  I give you Camello.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And last but not least,  sweet Lady Crane.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (cheering)  Give this a good beating.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Shake those fleas out.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 That's a dear.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  That crowd was shit.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Girl.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  What are you doing back here?  Nothing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I saw you the other day in the audience.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  How many times have you seen this stupid play?  Three times.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Did you pay?  No.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I remember when the players came to my village.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Just like you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Saw the painted faces, the costumes,  listened to the songs,  cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You're very good.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  My final speech is shit.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be,  the writing's no good.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  So change it.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  How would you change it?  The queen loves her son more than anything.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She wouldn't just cry.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She would be angry.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  What's your name?  Mercy.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Wonderful eyebrows.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Do you like pretending to be other people?  I have to go.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 My father's waiting for me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Lady Crane, they loved you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  They were sweet.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Or drunk.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Drunkenly sweet.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  No laugh for Ned's death.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  These people are worse than animals.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  But they loved her.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 They all love her.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I do what I can with what I'm given.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  With what you're given?  Well, I was thinking--  Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?  Full to the tits with ideas.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - I didn't mean-- - You have ideas, I have ideas,  he has ideas.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Why should my ideas have any more value than yours  simply because I've been doing this my whole life?  Who is anyone to judge my work?  This is my profession.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 I know what I'm doing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You have no right to an opinion.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (gasps)  Careful of that one.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She wants you dead.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And?  As I expected.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A shame.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A girl had many gifts.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You promised me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Don't let her suffer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Company, halt!  My lord.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  My lord.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  My friends, the hour has come.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Madness has overtaken this city  and grasped in its claws my children.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  But now we must drive it back  under the rocks whence it came.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Madness has had its day!  Captain: Forward, march!  Rich or poor, noble or common,  if we sin, we must atone.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Margaery of House Tyrell  came to us a sinner.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She stood before the gods  in the holy sept and lied.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  She disgraced her house,  her king, and herself.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (crowd murmuring)  Captain: Company, halt!  Face front!  Turn!  High Sparrow: Lord Tyrell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Ser Jaime.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Sorry to interrupt.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I don't have the authority to give them to you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And you don't have the authority to take them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - (crowd murmuring) - That's right.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Hyah.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - Captain: Lock spears! - (soldiers grunt)  I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You've already insulted one great house.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It won't happen twice.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Every last sparrow will die  before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  To die in the service of the gods  would please each and every one of us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We yearn for it.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  But there is no call for it today.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  There will be no walk of atonement.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (crowd murmuring)  Captain: Order up.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins  by bringing another  into the true light of the Seven.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (crowd murmuring)  Together we announce  a new age of harmony.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A holy alliance  between the Crown and the Faith.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (crowd cheering)  Woman: Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!  The Crown and the Faith  are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (crowd cheering)  What's happening?  He's beaten us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  That's what's happening.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit  to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You don't have to do this.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 You don't have to do anything.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I have to answer to the gods.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Not when you're sitting in that chair.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The Crown's decision on this matter is final.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Will I be walking naked in the streets?  Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first  to teach me about the gods' mercy?  You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And you will continue to do so.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  But not in this city.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You've lost it?  Black Walder: Yes, Father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Presumably you still know where it is.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You didn't lose Riverrun.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You let the Blackfish take it from you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He surprised us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 He knows the castle better than anyone.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him,  you couldn't find him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  That's what it means to lose something.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I don't think it's fair to blame us--  For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,  swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Not again.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 Riverrun is ours.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Take it back.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We don't have the men.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Black Walder: The Mallisters have risen against us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 And the Blackwoods.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Lothar: The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us,  raiding our supply trains and camps.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Black Walder: Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  They're laughing at us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  All across the Riverlands  right down to King's Landing,  they're laughing at us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I hear it in my sleep!  I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Take that castle back.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  He'll never yield, Father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Oh, he'll yield.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You'll show him the knife you used  to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly,  and you'll show him the knife you used  to open his niece's throat.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And you'll remind him who it was  that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  His nephew.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (chains rattling)  Cheer up, Lord Edmure.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You're going home.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own  because he's 400 years old.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Sent me with an army to the Riverlands  and a siege that could last months.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army  than in the sept dungeons.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'm not going to the Riverlands.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (pouring)  What, then?  I'm going to give Bronn  the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen  and have him gather the best killers he knows.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head  and every other sparrow head I can find.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - You can't.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - He has our son! He stole our son!  He's torn our family apart.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  How should we treat people who tear us apart?  We should treat them without mercy and we will.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And without you, this is all for nothing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Stand at the head of our army where you belong,  where Father wanted you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Show our men where their loyalties belong.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Show them what Lannisters are,  what we do to our enemies.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And take that stupid little castle back  because it's ours and because you can.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You'll stand trial soon.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 I need to be here for you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  It will be a trial by combat.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I have the Mountain.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  They've made us both stronger, all of them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  They have no idea how strong we are.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  No idea what we're going to do to them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We've always been together.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We'll always be together.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  We're the only two people in the world.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Why did you help us?  The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Now he lives again.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (gasps)  When I last saw you, you were a boy.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A fearless boy.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Who are you?  Uncle Benjen.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The last letter Jon wrote me  said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I led a ranging party deep into the North  to find white walkers.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  They found us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Left me there to die.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  To turn.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  The Children found me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  How?  The same way they made the walkers in the first place.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You saw it yourself.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Dragonglass.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  I didn't have time to learn.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 I can't control anything.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You must learn to control it  before the Night King comes.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Drink.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  One way or another,  he will find his way to the world of men.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  When he does,  you will be there waiting for him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And you will be ready.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - (horse whinnies) - (bird screeching)  (horse whinnies)  (shouts in Dothraki)  Daario: Everything all right?  How many days' ride to Meereen?  A week at best.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?  Dothraki and all their horses,  the Unsullied, the Second Sons--  1,000 ships easily.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  - Probably more.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	 - And who has that many?  Nobody.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  Nobody yet.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  And what then?  I take what is mine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  What was I made for?  You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (wind blowing)  Wait here.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	  (bird screeching)  (horses whinny)  (Dothraki muttering)    (dragon roaring)  (murmuring)  (roaring)  - (horses whinnying) - (shouting)  (roars)  (roars)            (cheering)        (cheering)      (cheering)        (cheering)  (cheering continues)    (cheering)    (roars)
s06e07	The Broken Man	Man: That's it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Get it right to the top.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - Man #2: Steady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Steady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - (men shouting)  (hisses)  (chatter)  (chatter)  Up she goes.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Hey, come on.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Put your back into it, huh?  Here you are, son.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - Oh, gentlemen, please.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - Man #3: To my right.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And you lot, come on.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Come on, get it moving.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Come on, come on.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 (laughs)  (panting)  (theme music playing)   In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  How many men did it take to cut you down?  Just one.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Ooh.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He must have been some kind of monster.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He was a woman.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (laughs)  (clanging)  (chatter)  I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm used to it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The way you were stinking already  and you had bugs all over you  and bone was coming through right there.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (laughs)  I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Oh, nearly shit myself.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I reckoned you were gonna die  by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days,  but you didn't.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 What kept you going?  Hate.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  No, there's a reason you're still here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Aye, there's a reason.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  No, a reason.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Gods aren't done with you yet.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I've heard that before.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Man was talking about a different god, though.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Well, maybe he was right.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't know much about the gods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're in the wrong line of work.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches  who think they know the word of god or gods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I don't even know their real names.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Maybe it is the Seven.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Or maybe it's the old gods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't know.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  What matters, I believe,  is that there's something greater than us.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You didn't know me back in my time.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You don't know the things I've done.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I've heard stories.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If the gods are real  why haven't they punished me?  They have.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Your Grace.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  What are we reading today?  The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Chapter three, verse 12.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Ah, "As water rounds the stones, smoothing--"  "Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love  calm a man's brute nature.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  A wife salves her husband's wounds,  a mother sings her son to sleep.
s06e07	The Broken Man	"  You learn quickly.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  There are some who know every verse of the sacred text,  but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood  and savages who can't read at all  who understand the Father's wisdom.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  For years I pretended  to love the poor, the afflicted.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I had pity for them, but I never loved them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  They disgusted me.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  They are hard to love.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The poor disgust us because they are us,  shorn of our illusions.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  How'd we smell without perfume.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (sighs) Can I ask you about a personal matter?  Of course.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The king mentioned that since your reunion,  you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  No.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You have a duty, Your Grace.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  To your husband, your king, your country,  to the gods themselves.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's just  the desires that once drove me no longer do.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Congress does not require desire  on the woman's part, only patience.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The king must have an heir  if we are to continue our good work.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Forgive me.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Sometimes the true path is hard to find.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Hard to find  and harder still to walk upon.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But you've made great progress.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  My grandmother?  Yes.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman,  a strong woman,  and an unrepentant sinner.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You must teach her the new way  as she taught you the old.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Or I fear for her safety,  body and soul.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (birds chirping)  Olenna: Does it move or talk?  I want to speak with you alone.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Oh, this is madness!  You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about  - Grandmother.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - until I tell them to stop.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If I tell them to stop.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - You could use a good bashing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - Grandmother, please.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  What have they done to you?  You marched against the High Sparrow,  - against the Faith.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - We marched for you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - They showed mercy.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - And what about your brother?  What mercy did they show him?  Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He'll have to renounce his name and title  - Have you lost your mind? - and live his life as a penitent.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He can begin again.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  As a mindless fanatic.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  As a free man.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You will leave for Highgarden today.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  There is no law that says you must stay here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I am the queen.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But you should leave, Grandmother.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Your place is at home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I will never leave you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Never.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - You must.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - (paper crinkles)  Go home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Find comfort in prayer and good works.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The Mother watches over us all.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'll see you soon, my dear.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Shall we pray?  Dim Dalba: We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,  when the time comes and we meant it,  but this isn't what we agreed to.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  These aren't white walkers.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  This isn't an army of the dead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  This isn't our fight.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Tormund: If it weren't for him, none of us would be here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Remember Mance's camp?  It stretched all the way to the horizon.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And look at us now.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Look what's left of us.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And if we lose this, we're gone.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Be like we were never there at all.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We'll be the last of the free folk.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  That's what'll happen to you if we lose.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,  they know you're here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  They know that more than half of you are women and children.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  After they finish with me, they'll come for you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're right.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  This isn't your fight.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I shouldn't be asking you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's not the deal we made.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I need you with me if we're going to beat them,  and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk  when no other southerners would.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He died for us.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And if that's what we are,  we deserve to be the last of the free folk.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (growls)  Snow.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Are you sure they'll come?  We're not clever like you southerners.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  When we say we'll do something, we do it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (exhales)  I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  That is hardly your concern.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Your grandson is still a prisoner.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You'll leave him rotting in a cell?  Loras rots in a cell because of you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you  and your stupidity.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're right.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I made a terrible mistake.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I carry it with me every single day.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Good.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And now we must fight them together.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We need each other.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  At a certain age, it's hard to recall.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But the truly vile do stand out through the years.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Do you remember the way you smirked at me  when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?  I do.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I'll never forget it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You love your granddaughter.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I love my son.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's the only truth I know.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We must defend them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can  before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If you're half as bright as you think you are,  you'll find a way out of here, too.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Never.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'll never leave my son.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  What'll you do, then?  You have no support.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Not anymore.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Your brother's gone.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 The High Sparrow saw to that.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The rest of your family have abandoned you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The people despise you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're going to kill them all by yourself?  You've lost, Cersei.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (horse whinnies)  Man: Pick the pace up.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Keep going.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Man #2: Keep it moving!  (horse whinnies)  Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Someone certainly does.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Oh, no.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Not me.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm just an upjumped sellsword.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're an anointed knight.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 There's quite a difference.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Aye, knights don't get paid.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You can be the right hand I lost.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You promised me a lordship and a castle  and a highborn beauty for a wife.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And you'll get all three.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 A Lannister always--  Don't say it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Don't fucking say it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - (chatter) - (horse whinnies)  (pigs grunting)  Lothar: Come out and fight us, Blackfish.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We have Lord Edmure.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Yield the castle or we'll hang him.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  This is your last warning.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Yield the castle.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You think I won't do it, old man?  I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Go on, then.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Cut his throat.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Lothar, is it?  Ser Jaime.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We didn't know you were coming.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Whoa, whoa.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Walder.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Now let's say I threatened to hit you  unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - What do you think I'd do? - I don't give a rat's--  I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Have him bathed and fed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Unless you'd like to take his place.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Apologies, Ser Jaime.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Do as he says.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The siege is now under my command.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts,  he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Bronn: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Set pickets every hundred yards.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Those are our siege towers--  As I said, the siege is under my command.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If that's not to your liking, go home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Get word to the Blackfish.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I want a parley.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  A parley or a fight?  He's an old man.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You've got one hand.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  My money's on the old boy.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (bird screeches)  (door opens)  Lady Mormont.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Welcome to Bear Island.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I remember when you were born, my lady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It was said she was a great beauty.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I'm sure you will be, too.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I doubt it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 My mother wasn't a great beauty  or any other kind of beauty.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  She was a great warrior, though.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  She died fighting for your brother Robb.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He was also a great warrior and an honorable man.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I was his steward.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 In fact--  I think we've had enough small talk.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Why are you here?  Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black  before he marched on Winterfell and was killed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - It said-- - I remember what it said.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Bear Island knows no king  but the King in the North whose name is Stark.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Robb is gone,  but House Stark is not.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And it needs your support now more than ever.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (whispering)  As far as I understand, you're a Snow  and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Or is she a Lannister?  I've heard conflicting reports.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I did what I had to do to survive, my lady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But I am a Stark.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I will always be a Stark.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If you say so.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 In any case,  you don't just want my allegiance.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 You want my fighting men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It is our duty to stop him.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  What you have to understand, my lady, is that--  I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?  If it please, my lady,  I understand how you feel.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't know you, Ser?  Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You needn't ask your maester about my house.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's rather new.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  How is it you understand how I feel?  You never thought you'd find yourself in your position.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I never thought I'd be in my position.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And now I find myself addressing the lady  of a great house in time of war.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's our war.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Go on, Ser Davos.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,  made that man his steward.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew  he had the courage to do what was right,  even if it meant giving his life.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood  that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's between the living and the dead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And make no mistake, my lady,  the dead are coming.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Is this true?  Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I fought them at Hardhome.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We both lost.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You want to protect your people, my lady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I understand.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But there's no hiding from this.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We have to fight and we need to do it together.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (whispering)  House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We will not break faith today.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Thank you, my lady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  How many fighting men can we expect?  (whispering)   - 62? - We are not a large house,  but we're a proud one.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And every man from Bear Island  fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If they're half as ferocious as their lady,  the Boltons are doomed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (horse whinnies)  (crossbows click)  Kingslayer.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Blackfish.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I assume you're here  to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't see Sansa and Arya.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - I don't have them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - Pity.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Do you wish to resume your captivity?  Then why are you here?  You know why I'm here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  This castle belongs to House Frey.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're trespassing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or--  Or you'll kill Edmure?  My nephew's marked for death no matter what.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Hang him and be done with it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It won't stop with Edmure.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You'll force me to storm the castle.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Hundreds will die.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Hundreds of mine.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Thousands of yours.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If you can breach the walls.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We'll breach them and kill every last one of you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But if you surrender,  I'll spare the lives of your men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  On my honor.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Your honor?  Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The war is over, ser.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?  As long as I'm standing, the war is not over.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  This is my home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  So you can either attack  or try to starve us out.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We have enough provisions for two years.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Do you have two years, Kingslayer?  You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Why did you come treat with me?  Sieges are dull.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Well, now you have.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Aye, now I have.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm disappointed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Glover: The answer is no.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - I've heard enough.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The Boltons helped us do it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Now you want me to fight against them?  I could be skinned for even talking to you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The Boltons are traitors.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Roose Bolton--  Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?  House Mormont.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And?  We sent ravens to Houses Manderly--  I don't care about ravens.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're asking me to join your army.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Who is fighting in this army?  The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (laughs)  Then the rumors are true.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I didn't dare believe them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I received you out of respect for your father.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Now I would like you to leave.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home  to fight alongside wildlings.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - Lord Glover.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 - There's nothing else to say.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I would remind you that House Glover  is pledged to House Stark.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Sworn to answer when called upon.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We wept when we heard of your father's death.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call  and hailed him King in the North.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And where was King Robb  when the ironborn attacked this castle?  When they threw my wife and children in prison  and brutalized and killed our subjects?  Taking up with a foreign whore.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I served House Stark once,  but House Stark is dead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (men shouting)  (birds screeching)  (chatter, laughter)  (laughing)  Why did we have to come here?  Some of us still like it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Have a drink at least.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't want one.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (sighs) Don't go far, love.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - (giggles) - I'll find you in a bit.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - (squeals) - (laughs)  Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Doesn't interest you anymore?  I'm sorry.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I won't joke about it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'll never hurt you, little brother.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Don't you know that?  You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?  Of course he is.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 As long as we're alive, we're a threat.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He'll find us.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's a great big world and we have fast ships.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't want any.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I don't care what you want.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Drink it all.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're ironborn, Theon.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I know you've had some bad years.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Some bad years?  But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Drink the goddamn ale.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Now listen to me.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I need you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Can you find him for me?  Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You escaped.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 You hear me?  You got away and you're never going back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We'll get justice for you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Fuck justice, then.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 We'll get revenge.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Listen to me.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If you're so broken that there's no coming back,  take a knife and cut your wrists.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  End it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But if you're staying, Theon, I need you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We're gonna sail to Meereen.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Are you with me?  Are you really with me?  Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while,  I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (men shouting)  Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And that's a good thing?  He was the most experienced commander in Westeros.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He chose this place for a reason.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Those mountains are a natural fortification.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  There's a stream down there for the horses.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We're not staying here long.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Another storm could hit any day.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Aye, the snows defeated Stannis  as much as the Boltons did.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  2,000 wildlings,  200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins--  62 Mormonts.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's not what we'd hoped for.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (men arguing)  For fuck's sake.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  So he's your most trusted advisor now?  Because he secured 62 men from a 10-year-old?  Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you  and he served Stannis for years.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Stannis who lost the Blackwater,  who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?  It's not enough.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 We need more men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  There's no time.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord--  We fight with the army we have.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (arguing continues)  Friends, this is not worth fighting over!  Davos: This'll be it, now.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Right, now we don't need to be fighting--  - Who the fuck are you? - Hold on.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Man: Yeah, who the fuck are you?  (crow caws)  (caws)  (birds chirping)  Ray: I was a soldier once.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  All my superiors thought I was brave.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I wasn't.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 I mean, I never ran from a fight.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  That's all I was, a coward.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We followed orders no matter the orders.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Burn that village.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Fine, I'm your arsonist.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Steal that farmer's crops.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Good, I'm your thief.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm your murderer.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I remember once a woman screaming at us,  calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  But we weren't animals.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Animals are true to their nature  and we had betrayed ours.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I cut that young boy's throat myself  as his mother screamed  and my friends held her back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  That night  I felt such shame.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Shame was so heavy on me,  I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  All I could do was stare into that dark sky  and listen to that mother screaming her son's name.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Now, I know I can never bring that lad back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  All I can do with time I've got left  is bring a little goodness into the world.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  That's all any of us can do, isn't it?  Never too late to stop robbing people,  to stop killing people.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Start helping people.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's never too late to come back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (horse whinnies)  And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's not even about the gods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 It's about you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Seven save you, friends.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  How can we help you?  What are you doing here?  Well, we're talking about life.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You?  Protecting the people.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Ray: Well, we thank you for your protection.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Who are you protecting us from?  (chuckles)  Do you have any horses?  No horses.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  No gold.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 No steel.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Food, then.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 Protecting the people is hungry work.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm sure it is.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're welcome to stay for supper,  but we have hungry mouths here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Stay safe.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  The night is dark and full of terrors.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  "Seven save you, friends.
s06e07	The Broken Man	"  I'm a fucking septon.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 What was I supposed to say?  They don't believe in your Seven.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  They're from the Brotherhood.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 They follow the Red God.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Aye, well, all are welcome here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Anyway, we got nothing for them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Sure, you do.
s06e07	The Broken Man	 You've got food,  you've got steel even if you say you don't.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And you've got women.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  What do you want to do? Fight them?  Kill them?  It'd be you against all of them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I mean, these people don't know how to fight.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You do.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm done with fighting.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Even if it's to protect yourself?  Violence is a disease.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You don't cure it by dying, either.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You've done enough work for one day.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Come on up for some supper.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  It's gonna be a cold night.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  We'll need firewood.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'll save you a bowl of stew.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  Might even have some ale hidden away.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (chatter)  He's not a lying man.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm inclined to believe him.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You're Westerosi.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  What do you care?  I want to book passage home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (laughs) You? Can't afford it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (coins jingle)  Where'd you steal this from?  Why do you care?  We leave in two days.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  You can have a hammock in steerage.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (coins jingle)  I want a cabin.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  And we'll leave at dawn.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  See you at sunrise.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  (birds screeching)  Sweet girl.
s06e07	The Broken Man	  - (blade rings) - (groans)  (grunting)  (shouts)  (gasping)  (whimpering)  (whimpering echoes)  (birds chirping)  (sighs)  (people screaming)  (fly buzzing)  (wood, rope creaking)
s06e08	No One	(theme music playing)   Lady Crane: My son.
s06e08	No One	  My firstborn son.
s06e08	No One	  My child king, hush.
s06e08	No One	  Listen to the gods, for you they sing.
s06e08	No One	  Fight no more, sweet child.
s06e08	No One	  Your wars are won.
s06e08	No One	  The wolves are buried  and the false stag done.
s06e08	No One	  Shut your blue eyes, my love.
s06e08	No One	  Let the crown fall.
s06e08	No One	  The Father above beckons you to his hall.
s06e08	No One	  In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more.
s06e08	No One	  But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore  and my brother the Imp  who killed his own king.
s06e08	No One	  Born amongst lions, our curse from within.
s06e08	No One	  I will slay him, I swear.
s06e08	No One	  With noose or with knife,  though it take me a fortnight,  a moon or my life.
s06e08	No One	  (applause)  (cheering)  (music playing)  Bobono: What is that I hear and smell?  - (audience booing) - Someone I'll soon send to hell.
s06e08	No One	  It's time to see if truth they told  who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
s06e08	No One	  Man: Get the wig!  Izembaro: You beast, you beast.
s06e08	No One	 You killed my wife.
s06e08	No One	  And now you've taken your father's life.
s06e08	No One	  No worse child ever stained this land.
s06e08	No One	  I curse the day I named you.
s06e08	No One	 (groans)  (crowd cheers, laughs)  Bobono: My greatest crime!  (thudding)  (people laughing, chatting)  You're good at that.
s06e08	No One	  Where did you learn?  I'm a jealous woman.
s06e08	No One	  I've always liked bad men  and they've always liked me.
s06e08	No One	  They'd come home wherever home was that night  stinking of some whore's perfume.
s06e08	No One	  So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them.
s06e08	No One	  And then I'd feel terrible,  so I'd patch them up.
s06e08	No One	  I got good at patching them up.
s06e08	No One	  And good at putting holes in them.
s06e08	No One	  (chuckles) And that.
s06e08	No One	  What happened to the actress?  The one who wanted you dead.
s06e08	No One	  Bianca.
s06e08	No One	  She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress  after what I did to her face.
s06e08	No One	  (slurps)  Mmm.
s06e08	No One	  I never did learn to cook.
s06e08	No One	  But eat.
s06e08	No One	 Eat.
s06e08	No One	 You need it.
s06e08	No One	  The company is moving on to Pentos soon.
s06e08	No One	  You should come with us.
s06e08	No One	  - I can't.
s06e08	No One	 - Why not?  Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.
s06e08	No One	  And besides, we need a new actress.
s06e08	No One	  I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
s06e08	No One	  Come with us.
s06e08	No One	  What's left for you here?  You wouldn't be safe.
s06e08	No One	  Not while she's looking for me.
s06e08	No One	  Who?  She doesn't have a name.
s06e08	No One	  Where will you go?  Essos is east and Westeros is west.
s06e08	No One	  But what's west of Westeros?  I don't know.
s06e08	No One	  Nobody does.
s06e08	No One	  That's where all the maps stop.
s06e08	No One	  The edge of the world, maybe.
s06e08	No One	  I'd like to see that.
s06e08	No One	  (groans)  - What's that? - Milk of the poppy.
s06e08	No One	  I don't want any.
s06e08	No One	  Sleep is the only way you'll heal.
s06e08	No One	  Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.
s06e08	No One	  (men laughing)  (horse neighs)  Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.
s06e08	No One	  I was a famous kisser.
s06e08	No One	  You lads know how to kiss proper?  Course we do.
s06e08	No One	  This is for masters, this technique.
s06e08	No One	  - You're not ready.
s06e08	No One	 - I'm ready.
s06e08	No One	  He says he's ready.
s06e08	No One	  All right.
s06e08	No One	 Now, pay attention.
s06e08	No One	  You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.
s06e08	No One	  Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.
s06e08	No One	  Very romantic.
s06e08	No One	  Take your middle finger, yeah,  and you jam it right up her bunghole.
s06e08	No One	  (laughing)  So fucking close!  Ah, it smells like pussy to me.
s06e08	No One	  Look at him.
s06e08	No One	 You get hard, boy?  Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
s06e08	No One	  (laughing)  Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?  (growls)  - (shouts) - (groans)  (grunts)  (groans)  (whimpering)  Where's the other one?  - The one with the yellow cloak.
s06e08	No One	 - Fuck you!  Those are your last words, fuck you?  Come on, you can do better.
s06e08	No One	  Cunt!  You're shit at dying, you know that?  - (whimpering) - (shouts)  (squelches, thuds)  (chatter)  (bellows)          I'd call that a successful gambit.
s06e08	No One	  - Would you? - Look around.
s06e08	No One	  The city has come back to life.
s06e08	No One	  - You made a pact with fanatics.
s06e08	No One	 - I did and it worked.
s06e08	No One	  If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.
s06e08	No One	  That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.
s06e08	No One	  Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
s06e08	No One	  I'm going to miss you.
s06e08	No One	  I know.
s06e08	No One	  I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
s06e08	No One	  If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.
s06e08	No One	  We need friends in Westeros.
s06e08	No One	  And we need ships.
s06e08	No One	  Most of all, we need our queen.
s06e08	No One	  She'll come back.
s06e08	No One	 She has to.
s06e08	No One	  My heart's been broken too many times already.
s06e08	No One	  I'll walk the rest of the way myself.
s06e08	No One	  I can't go off on a secret mission  in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
s06e08	No One	  Varys.
s06e08	No One	  The most famous dwarf in the world.
s06e08	No One	  (knocks)  Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant  have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.
s06e08	No One	  Have been permitted?  That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
s06e08	No One	  They demand to see you, Your Grace.
s06e08	No One	  Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?  The king is aware of their presence?  He is, Your Grace.
s06e08	No One	  He's currently in his chambers at prayer.
s06e08	No One	  Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon  wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.
s06e08	No One	  His Holiness the High Septon  is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
s06e08	No One	  Your Grace, this is not a request.
s06e08	No One	  It is a request, Cousin Lancel.
s06e08	No One	  You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.
s06e08	No One	  The High Septon commands you.
s06e08	No One	  Are you sure you want to refuse him?  He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
s06e08	No One	  He made no such promises.
s06e08	No One	  If you refuse to come of your own free will--  Get out.
s06e08	No One	  Move aside, ser.
s06e08	No One	  (raspy breathing)  Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
s06e08	No One	  I choose violence.
s06e08	No One	  (grunts)  (grunts)  (gasping)  (gasping)  Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
s06e08	No One	  (men shouting)  Looks like a siege, my lady.
s06e08	No One	  You have a keen military mind, Pod.
s06e08	No One	  My lady.
s06e08	No One	 My lady.
s06e08	No One	  Who goes there?!  State your business!  My name is Brienne of Tarth.
s06e08	No One	  Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him.
s06e08	No One	  Tell him I have his sword.
s06e08	No One	  (men shouting)  (grunting)  Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?  (coughing)  (laughs)  Podrick fucking Payne.
s06e08	No One	  I thought you'd be dead by now.
s06e08	No One	  Not yet.
s06e08	No One	  (laughs)  - Are they in there? - Uh-huh.
s06e08	No One	  You think they're fucking?  What?  No.
s06e08	No One	  Why not? I'd fuck her.
s06e08	No One	  You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?  - I'm her squire.
s06e08	No One	 - Oh.
s06e08	No One	  (chuckles) Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.
s06e08	No One	  And she'd fuck him, don't you think?  The way she looks at him.
s06e08	No One	  The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.
s06e08	No One	  I preferred working with the little brother on that account.
s06e08	No One	  Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.
s06e08	No One	  You must have shown it to her by now.
s06e08	No One	  - She's training me to fight.
s06e08	No One	 - Is she?  Oh.
s06e08	No One	 - An hour in the morning, an hour at night.
s06e08	No One	  Every day.
s06e08	No One	  Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?  Well, that's a different sort of fighting.
s06e08	No One	  Now, that's the truth, isn't it?  You want to learn that sort of fighting?  All right.
s06e08	No One	  All right, let's start with your footwork.
s06e08	No One	  Show me your stance.
s06e08	No One	  Now listen to me, Pod.
s06e08	No One	  See how your feet are about a yard apart?  Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.
s06e08	No One	  'Cause they do, Pod.
s06e08	No One	 Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.
s06e08	No One	  Do it again.
s06e08	No One	 Come on, don't sulk.
s06e08	No One	  Jaime: I never thought you'd find her.
s06e08	No One	  I just assumed Sansa was dead.
s06e08	No One	  Why would you assume that?  In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.
s06e08	No One	  I don't think you know many girls like her.
s06e08	No One	  Well, I'm proud of you.
s06e08	No One	  I am.
s06e08	No One	 You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark  against all odds.
s06e08	No One	  Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.
s06e08	No One	  The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder,  so there is that complication.
s06e08	No One	  What the hell are you doing here?  I've come for the Blackfish.
s06e08	No One	  You're welcome to have him.
s06e08	No One	  Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons  and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
s06e08	No One	  With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?  The Tully army.
s06e08	No One	  They're a bit occupied at the moment.
s06e08	No One	  I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun  currently defended by the Tully rebels,  so you can see the conundrum.
s06e08	No One	  The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?  Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
s06e08	No One	  As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
s06e08	No One	  Exactly.
s06e08	No One	  We shouldn't argue about politics.
s06e08	No One	  You're a knight, Ser Jaime.
s06e08	No One	  I know there is honor in you.
s06e08	No One	  - I've seen it myself.
s06e08	No One	 - I'm a Lannister.
s06e08	No One	  Don't ask me to betray my own house.
s06e08	No One	  I do no such thing.
s06e08	No One	  Take Riverrun without bloodshed.
s06e08	No One	  Ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact.
s06e08	No One	  What do you propose?  Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce.
s06e08	No One	  Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
s06e08	No One	  Why would he abandon his ancestral home?  Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
s06e08	No One	  Have you ever met the Blackfish?  - No.
s06e08	No One	 - He's even more stubborn than you are.
s06e08	No One	  All right.
s06e08	No One	  Try to talk some sense into the old goat.
s06e08	No One	  He won't listen, but his men might.
s06e08	No One	  Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.
s06e08	No One	  I need your word.
s06e08	No One	  If I persuade him to abandon the castle,  you'll grant a safe passage north.
s06e08	No One	  You have my word.
s06e08	No One	  You have until nightfall.
s06e08	No One	  (sighs)  You gave it to me for a purpose.
s06e08	No One	  I've achieved that purpose.
s06e08	No One	  It's yours.
s06e08	No One	  It will always be yours.
s06e08	No One	  One last thing, Ser Jaime.
s06e08	No One	  Yes, Lady Brienne?  Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender  and if you attack the castle,  honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.
s06e08	No One	  Of course it does.
s06e08	No One	  To fight you.
s06e08	No One	  Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
s06e08	No One	  Blackfish: I've said no three times already.
s06e08	No One	  I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
s06e08	No One	  I haven't seen her since she was a child.
s06e08	No One	  I don't know her signature.
s06e08	No One	 I don't know you.
s06e08	No One	  And I will not surrender.
s06e08	No One	 Double the guards tonight.
s06e08	No One	  The Kingslayer wants to try us.
s06e08	No One	  I can feel it.
s06e08	No One	  As I have said, my name is--  Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
s06e08	No One	 I know your father.
s06e08	No One	  - Good man.
s06e08	No One	 - He always spoke highly of you.
s06e08	No One	  And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.
s06e08	No One	  If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat  on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool.
s06e08	No One	  Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
s06e08	No One	  We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
s06e08	No One	  - He's not my friend.
s06e08	No One	 - No?  Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle?  Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?  Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark.
s06e08	No One	  He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted.
s06e08	No One	  He gave me this sword to protect her.
s06e08	No One	  That is what I have done and I will continue to do  until the day I die.
s06e08	No One	  (chuckles)  She's exactly like her mother.
s06e08	No One	  I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
s06e08	No One	  You have more than she does.
s06e08	No One	  She wants her home back.
s06e08	No One	 I understand that.
s06e08	No One	  But this is my home.
s06e08	No One	  And if Jaime Lannister wants it,  he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.
s06e08	No One	  Find the maester.
s06e08	No One	  We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
s06e08	No One	  What should I write?  Tell her I failed.
s06e08	No One	  (chatter)  There's to be a royal announcement?  There is.
s06e08	No One	  Why wasn't I informed?  There is to be a royal announcement  in the throne room  at this very moment.
s06e08	No One	  Where are you going?  To stand by my son.
s06e08	No One	  Your place is in the gallery  with the other ladies of the court.
s06e08	No One	  Pycelle: Your Grace  Tommen: Lords and ladies,  the Faith and the Crown  are the two pillars that hold up this world.
s06e08	No One	  One collapses, so does the other.
s06e08	No One	  The Father judges us all.
s06e08	No One	  If you break his laws  you will be punished.
s06e08	No One	  After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon,  we have determined that Loras Tyrell  and Cersei Lannister's trial  will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor  on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.
s06e08	No One	  (crowd murmuring)  Furthermore, after much prayer  and reflection,  the Crown has decided that from this day forward,  trial by combat will be forbidden  throughout the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e08	No One	  (crowd murmuring)  Tommen: The tradition is a brutish one,  a scheme devised by corrupt rulers  in order to avoid true judgment from the gods.
s06e08	No One	  Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell  will stand trial before seven septons  as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.
s06e08	No One	  Seven blessings to all.
s06e08	No One	  Crowd: Seven blessings.
s06e08	No One	  (doors open)  Your Grace  that old rumor you told me about.
s06e08	No One	  My little birds investigated.
s06e08	No One	  And?  Was it just a rumor or something more?  More.
s06e08	No One	  Much more.
s06e08	No One	  Missandei: You seem happy.
s06e08	No One	  I am happy.
s06e08	No One	  You should both be happy as well.
s06e08	No One	  Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.
s06e08	No One	  Now it's like a man reborn.
s06e08	No One	  I will be happy when our queen returns.
s06e08	No One	  Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?  Unsullied never drink.
s06e08	No One	  - Why not? - Rules.
s06e08	No One	  And who made these rules?  Your former masters?  Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human.
s06e08	No One	  Have a drink with me.
s06e08	No One	  And you? What's your excuse?  I have tried wine before.
s06e08	No One	  It made me feel funny.
s06e08	No One	  That's how you know it's working.
s06e08	No One	  Here's to our queen.
s06e08	No One	  Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
s06e08	No One	  To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,  Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.
s06e08	No One	  - Long may she reign.
s06e08	No One	 - Long may she reign.
s06e08	No One	  Tyrion: Do you like it?  Tastes like it has turned.
s06e08	No One	  Yes, yes.
s06e08	No One	 Fermentation.
s06e08	No One	  One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms  I'd like to have my own vineyard.
s06e08	No One	  Make my own wine.
s06e08	No One	  The Imp's Delight.
s06e08	No One	  Only my close friends could drink it.
s06e08	No One	  Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.
s06e08	No One	  I do not know any jokes.
s06e08	No One	  Grey Worm?  Right.
s06e08	No One	  Three lords walk into a tavern--  a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.
s06e08	No One	  They order ale,  but when the barkeep brings them over,  each of them finds a fly in his cup.
s06e08	No One	  The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.
s06e08	No One	  The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.
s06e08	No One	  The Stark reaches into his cup,  pulls out the fly and shouts,  "Spit it out, you wee shit.
s06e08	No One	  Spit it out.
s06e08	No One	"  It's funnier in Westeros.
s06e08	No One	  The Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.
s06e08	No One	  Yes.
s06e08	No One	  A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.
s06e08	No One	  Not a true story, necessarily.
s06e08	No One	  A story that's supposed to make you laugh ideally.
s06e08	No One	  Not at the moment, perhaps.
s06e08	No One	  Missandei, do you like the wine?  I do.
s06e08	No One	  Tell a joke.
s06e08	No One	  Two translators are on a sinking ship.
s06e08	No One	  The first says,  "Do you know how to swim?"  The second says, "No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.
s06e08	No One	"  Ah! (laughing)  That is the worst joke I ever heard.
s06e08	No One	  You don't even know what a joke is.
s06e08	No One	  I am soldier all my life.
s06e08	No One	 You think I never hear joke?  You lied to us.
s06e08	No One	  I make joke.
s06e08	No One	  (laughing)  More jokes.
s06e08	No One	  I once walked into a brothel  with a honeycomb and a jackass.
s06e08	No One	  - The madam says-- - (bells ringing)  (Grey Worm shouting in Valyrian)  (bells continue ringing)  The Masters have come for their property.
s06e08	No One	  (men shouting)  Lord Edmure.
s06e08	No One	  I apologize for the way the Freys treated you.
s06e08	No One	  A man of your birth deserves better.
s06e08	No One	  You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothed from now on.
s06e08	No One	  I have your word?  (scoffs)  Oh, good.
s06e08	No One	  Good, that's--  that's a fine thing.
s06e08	No One	  My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser.
s06e08	No One	  Whatever game you're playing.
s06e08	No One	  The Blackfish is an old man.
s06e08	No One	  A good death is all he can hope for.
s06e08	No One	  But you, you have a child now, I've heard.
s06e08	No One	  A son you sired on your wedding night.
s06e08	No One	  You're a potent man.
s06e08	No One	  A son I've never met  born of a wife that I haven't seen  since our first night together.
s06e08	No One	  You should be with them both.
s06e08	No One	  I can arrange that, you realize?  Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.
s06e08	No One	  A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride.
s06e08	No One	  And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own.
s06e08	No One	  Do you imagine yourself a decent person?  Is that it?  After you've massacred my family.
s06e08	No One	  Kept me in a cell for years.
s06e08	No One	  Stolen our lands.
s06e08	No One	  I'll remind you that our houses are at war.
s06e08	No One	  I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you,  but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.
s06e08	No One	  Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.
s06e08	No One	  Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation?  It's not.
s06e08	No One	  You understand.
s06e08	No One	 On some level you understand  that you're an evil man.
s06e08	No One	  I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
s06e08	No One	  Well, that is convenient for you.
s06e08	No One	  You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?  (chuckles)  Your square jaw,  your golden armor.
s06e08	No One	  Tell me, I want to know.
s06e08	No One	  I truly do.
s06e08	No One	  How do you live with yourself?  All of us have to believe  that we're decent, don't we?  You have to sleep at night.
s06e08	No One	  How do you tell yourself  that you're decent  after everything that you've done?  I was your sister's prisoner once.
s06e08	No One	  She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
s06e08	No One	  (laughs)  Yeah.
s06e08	No One	  She should have killed you.
s06e08	No One	  Perhaps, but she didn't.
s06e08	No One	  Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.
s06e08	No One	  But I didn't hate her.
s06e08	No One	  I admired her.
s06e08	No One	  Far more than her husband or her son.
s06e08	No One	  Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?  No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner.
s06e08	No One	  You don't have a choice.
s06e08	No One	  The love she had for her children,  I was a little awed by it.
s06e08	No One	  Reminded me of my sister.
s06e08	No One	  Oh.
s06e08	No One	 Oh, I see.
s06e08	No One	  You're a madman.
s06e08	No One	  I'm not here to trade insults.
s06e08	No One	  - Your sister was a strong-- - Don't talk about Cat!  - I'll talk about whomever I want.
s06e08	No One	 - (grunts)  She loved her children.
s06e08	No One	  I suppose all mothers do,  but Catelyn and Cersei,  there's a fierceness you don't often see.
s06e08	No One	  They'd do anything to protect their babies.
s06e08	No One	  Start a war.
s06e08	No One	  Burn cities to ash.
s06e08	No One	 Free their worst enemies.
s06e08	No One	  The things we do for love.
s06e08	No One	  You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
s06e08	No One	  That's exactly why I came here.
s06e08	No One	  I love Cersei.
s06e08	No One	  You can laugh at that if you want.
s06e08	No One	  You can sneer.
s06e08	No One	 Doesn't matter.
s06e08	No One	  She needs me.
s06e08	No One	  And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun.
s06e08	No One	  I'll send for your baby boy.
s06e08	No One	  And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult.
s06e08	No One	  Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure.
s06e08	No One	  Your son doesn't matter to me.
s06e08	No One	  The people in the castle don't matter to me.
s06e08	No One	  Only Cersei.
s06e08	No One	  And if I have to slaughter every Tully  who ever lived to get back to her,  that's what I'll do.
s06e08	No One	  Guard: Who goes there?  Edmure Tully,  son of Hoster Tully  and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.
s06e08	No One	  I demand entry.
s06e08	No One	  Don't let him in.
s06e08	No One	  He's the Lord of Riverrun.
s06e08	No One	  I have to obey his commands.
s06e08	No One	  He's been their captive  ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.
s06e08	No One	  Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding  would decide to let him come home?  Because it's a trap, you idiot.
s06e08	No One	  Don't let him in.
s06e08	No One	  He's my lord, my lord.
s06e08	No One	  I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.
s06e08	No One	  You're not obeying Edmure's commands.
s06e08	No One	  You're obeying the fucking Kingslayer's commands.
s06e08	No One	  Edmure: I demand entry.
s06e08	No One	  My lord has given an order.
s06e08	No One	  With a knife to his throat.
s06e08	No One	  That is not a valid order.
s06e08	No One	  Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed--  Man: Aye, ser.
s06e08	No One	  I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
s06e08	No One	  You are not lord of this castle, my lord.
s06e08	No One	  - Lower the drawbridge.
s06e08	No One	 - Man #2: Aye, ser!  Black Walder: If you're wrong,  we've just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.
s06e08	No One	  Welcome home, my lord.
s06e08	No One	  Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms.
s06e08	No One	  Open the gates.
s06e08	No One	  - My lord-- - Your lord has given a command.
s06e08	No One	  (men shouting)  Man: Infantry, advance!  Find the Blackfish.
s06e08	No One	  Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
s06e08	No One	  Find him.
s06e08	No One	  Go on.
s06e08	No One	  Come with us.
s06e08	No One	  I've run before from the Red Wedding.
s06e08	No One	  I'm not running again.
s06e08	No One	 This is my family home.
s06e08	No One	  Your family is in the North.
s06e08	No One	 Come with us.
s06e08	No One	  Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
s06e08	No One	  You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
s06e08	No One	  Guard: All the way down!  - Check that out! - Go on, now.
s06e08	No One	  I haven't had a proper sword fight in years.
s06e08	No One	  I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.
s06e08	No One	  (men shouting)  We found the Blackfish, my lord.
s06e08	No One	  Good.
s06e08	No One	  Bring him to me.
s06e08	No One	  He died fighting, my lord.
s06e08	No One	  (men shouting)  - I was wrong.
s06e08	No One	 I admit it.
s06e08	No One	 - That changes nothing.
s06e08	No One	  The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead.
s06e08	No One	  If the slavers' forces--  No more talking from you.
s06e08	No One	 Your talking gave us this.
s06e08	No One	  And I have acknowledged that.
s06e08	No One	 I'm trying--  You're trying to tell me what the army should do.
s06e08	No One	  You do not know what the army should do.
s06e08	No One	  All right, what should the army do?  We'll not go to the beach.
s06e08	No One	  If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid.
s06e08	No One	  The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend.
s06e08	No One	  - We stay here.
s06e08	No One	 - And then?  We wait for them to come to us.
s06e08	No One	  Then we fight them.
s06e08	No One	  (thudding, rattling)  (thumping)  (dragon screeches)  - (distant horse whinnies) - (men shouting)  Clegane.
s06e08	No One	  What the fuck you doing here?  Chasing them.
s06e08	No One	 You?  Hanging them.
s06e08	No One	  Any particular reason?  They're our men.
s06e08	No One	 Or they were.
s06e08	No One	  They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers.
s06e08	No One	  Why do you want them?  Same reason.
s06e08	No One	  I was helping build it.
s06e08	No One	  They killed a friend of mine.
s06e08	No One	  You've got friends?  Not anymore.
s06e08	No One	 They're mine.
s06e08	No One	  It's the Brotherhood's good name they've dragged through the dirt.
s06e08	No One	  Fuck your name.
s06e08	No One	 They're mine.
s06e08	No One	  I killed you once before, Dondarrion.
s06e08	No One	  Happy to do it again.
s06e08	No One	  Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.
s06e08	No One	  Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
s06e08	No One	  You can have one of them.
s06e08	No One	  Two.
s06e08	No One	  No, no, no.
s06e08	No One	  We're not butchers.
s06e08	No One	 We hang them.
s06e08	No One	  Hanging?  All over in an instant.
s06e08	No One	  Where's the punishment in that?  - They die.
s06e08	No One	 - We all bloody die.
s06e08	No One	  Except this one here.
s06e08	No One	  I'll only gut one of them.
s06e08	No One	  Beric: No.
s06e08	No One	  I'll chop off one hand.
s06e08	No One	  We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss.
s06e08	No One	  That's generous.
s06e08	No One	  Bunch of nancies.
s06e08	No One	  There was a time I would have killed all seven of you  just to gut these three.
s06e08	No One	  You're getting old, Clegane.
s06e08	No One	  He's not.
s06e08	No One	  (gasping)  Please don't.
s06e08	No One	 I'll give you anything.
s06e08	No One	  (choking)  (choking)  (choking continues)  Got anything to eat?  (distant horse whinnying)  Enjoying yourself?  I prefer chicken.
s06e08	No One	  You ought to join us.
s06e08	No One	 We could use you.
s06e08	No One	  I tried joining.
s06e08	No One	 Didn't work out for me.
s06e08	No One	  Clegane, we're here for a reason.
s06e08	No One	  The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason.
s06e08	No One	  He gave a failed, drunk priest  the power to bring him back for a reason.
s06e08	No One	  We are part of something larger than ourselves.
s06e08	No One	  Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done  for something larger than ourselves.
s06e08	No One	  Cold winds are rising in the North.
s06e08	No One	  And you're going to go stop them?  We need good men to help us.
s06e08	No One	  Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.
s06e08	No One	  Beric: True enough.
s06e08	No One	  But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me.
s06e08	No One	  - Why? - (laughs)  I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric.
s06e08	No One	  I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord  and I'm better than you now.
s06e08	No One	  Aye, you're probably right.
s06e08	No One	  You're a fighter.
s06e08	No One	  You were born a fighter.
s06e08	No One	  You walked away from the fight.
s06e08	No One	  How did that go?  Good and bad, young and old,  the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike.
s06e08	No One	  You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.
s06e08	No One	  It's not too late for you.
s06e08	No One	  (footsteps approach)  (groans)  - (thuds) - (gasping)  Lady Crane?  (winces)  Lady Crane?  If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly.
s06e08	No One	  Instead  The Many-Faced God was promised a name.
s06e08	No One	  He must always receive what is his.
s06e08	No One	  You can't change that.
s06e08	No One	  I can't change that.
s06e08	No One	  No one can.
s06e08	No One	  And now he's been promised another name.
s06e08	No One	  (grunts)  - Hey! - Get out!  - Yah! - (grunts)  - (man coughs) - (gasps)  (chatter)  - (grunts) - (woman screams)  Hey!  - Yah! - (man shouts)  Ah!  (crowd shouts)  (groans)  (crowd clamoring)  Woman: My basket!  (panting)  (groaning)  (whimpering)  (panting)  It will all be over soon.
s06e08	No One	  On your knees or on your feet?  (groans)  Haven't we been through this already?  That won't help you.
s06e08	No One	  You told her to kill me.
s06e08	No One	  Yes.
s06e08	No One	  But here you are.
s06e08	No One	  And there she is.
s06e08	No One	  Finally a girl is no one.
s06e08	No One	  A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell  and I'm going home.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	(theme music playing)   (booming)  (man shouts in Valyrian)  (men grunting)  (man #2 shouts in Valyrian)  (man #3 shouts in Valyrian)  (men screaming)  (explosions)  Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (explosions)  Perhaps we should take shelter.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The city's on the rise?  Meereen is strong.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Commerce has returned to the markets.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - The people are behind you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 - (explosion)  Well, not all the people, of course.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery,  - a city without Masters - (explosions)  it proves that no one needs a Master.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Good.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Shall we begin?  Do we have a plan?  I will crucify the Masters.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I will set their fleets afire,  kill every last one of their soldiers,  and return their cities to the dirt.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  That is my plan.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You don't approve?  You once told me you knew what your father was.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Did you know his plans for King's Landing  when the Lannister armies were at his gates?  (explosions)  Probably not.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep,  the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,  all the major thoroughfares.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He would have burned every one of his citizens.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The loyal ones and the traitors.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Every man, woman, and child.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  That's why Jaime killed him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  This is entirely different.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You're talking about destroying cities.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  It's not entirely different.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Once before, I offered you peace.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  If you had not been so arrogant,  you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot  like the beggar queen you are.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Tyrion: We are here to discuss terms of surrender,  not to trade insults.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The terms are simple.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid  and the city of Meereen.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz  will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain  to be sold again to the highest bidder.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We obviously didn't communicate clearly.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I imagine it's difficult  adjusting to the new reality.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Your reign is over.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  My reign has just begun.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (dragon screeching)  (men shouting)  (roars)  (screeching)  (screeching)  (screaming)  (whooping)  (galloping hoofbeats)  (whooping continues)  (shouting)  (roaring)  (shouting in Valyrian)  Dracarys.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (men screaming)  (screaming continues)  (men screaming)        (distant dragon screeches)  (man shouts)  Thank you for the armada.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Our queen does love ships.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You violated that pact.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You declared war upon us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Though our queen does have a forgiving nature,  this cannot be forgiven.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Our queen insists that one of you must die  as punishment for your crimes.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it,  other people dying?  Him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 He should die.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - Belicho: Yes, him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 - Razdal: He's not one of us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He's an outsider, a lowborn.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He does not speak for us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Please.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Please.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (both groan)  Tell your people what happened here.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  When they come forward with notions of retribution  or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory,  remind them what happened  when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (dragons screeching)  (horses whinnying)  You don't have to be here.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Yes, I do.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  My beloved wife.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I've missed you terribly.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Now, dismount and kneel before me,  surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell  and Warden of the North.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Come, bastard,  you don't have the men, you don't have the horses,  and you don't have Winterfell.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Why lead those poor souls into slaughter?  There's no need for a battle.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Get off your horse and kneel.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I'm a man of mercy.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You're right.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  There's no need for a battle.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Thousands of men don't need to die.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Only one of us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Let's end this the old way.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You against me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (chuckling)  I keep hearing stories about you, bastard.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The way people in the North talk about you,  you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Maybe you are that good.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Maybe not.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I don't know if I'd beat you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  But I know that my army will beat yours.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I have 6,000 men.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You have, what, half that?  Not even?  Aye, you have the numbers.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Will your men want to fight for you  when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?  He's good.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 Very good.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Tell me, will you let your little brother die  because you're too proud to surrender?  How do we know you have him?  Now, if you want to save--  You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Sleep well.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  She's a fine woman, your sister.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I look forward to having her back in my bed.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And you're all fine-looking men.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  My dogs are desperate to meet you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I haven't fed them for seven days.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They're ravenous.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I wonder which parts they'll try first.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Your eyes?  Your balls?  We'll find out soon enough.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  In the morning, then, bastard.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Jon: If he was smart, he'd stay inside  the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  That's not his way.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 He knows the North is watching.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  If the other houses sense weakness on his part,  they'll stop fearing him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He can't have that.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 Fear is his power.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  It's his weakness, too.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 His men don't want to fight for him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They're forced to fight for him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 If they feel the tide turning  It's not his men that worry me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  It's his horses.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I know what mounted knights can do to us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We're digging trenches all along our flanks.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you,  in a double envelopment.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  A pincer move.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Good.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  It's crucial that we let them charge at us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They've got the numbers, we need the patience.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Did you really think that cunt would fight you man-to-man?  No.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  But I wanted to make him angry.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I want him coming at us full tilt.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We should all get some sleep.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Tormund: Rest, Jon Snow.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 We need you sharp tomorrow.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  So you've met the enemy,  drawn up your battle plans.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Aye, for what they're worth.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You've known him for the space of a single conversation,  you and your trusted advisors,  and you sit around making your plans  on how to defeat a man you don't know.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I lived with him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I know the way his mind works.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I know how he likes to hurt people.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?  You're right.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You think he's going to fall into your trap.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He won't.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 He's the one who lays traps.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - He's overconfident.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 - He plays with people.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He's far better at it than you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 He's been doing it all his life.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks?  I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You don't know him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  All right, tell me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?  We'll never get him back.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,  which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay  than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested,  which means he won't live long.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We can't give up on our brother.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Listen to me, please.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 He wants you to make a mistake.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Of course he does.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 What should I do differently?  I don't know.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 I don't know anything about battles.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Just don't do what he wants you to do.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Aye, that's good advice.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You think that's obvious?  Well, it is a bit obvious.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  If you had asked for my advice earlier,  I would have told you not to attack Winterfell  until we had a larger force, or is that obvious, too?  When will we have a larger force?  We've pleaded with every house that'll have us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The Blackfish can't help us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We're lucky to have this many men.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - It's not enough.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 - No, it's not enough.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 It's what we have.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Battles have been won against greater odds.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  If Ramsay wins,  I'm not going back there alive.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Do you understand me?  I won't let ever let him touch you again.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I'll protect you, I promise.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No one can protect me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No one can protect anyone.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (sighs)  Davos: You think there's hope?  Tormund: I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And they've never seen the free folk fight,  so, yes, there's hope.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You want to avenge your king, don't you?  It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  It was Stannis himself.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I loved the man.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He lifted me up and made me something.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - You saw these demons? - What?  No, it's a manner of speaking.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Not actual demons.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Oh.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Well, you loved that cunt Stannis  and I loved the man he burned.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Mance didn't have demons in his skull.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I believed in him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  But I was wrong just like you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Jon Snow's not a king.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No, he's not.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You want some?  I have a jug of sour goat's milk  stronger than any of that grape water  you southern twats like sucking on.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No, thanks.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 It does sound delicious,  but I better keep a clear head.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I can never sleep the night before a battle.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  So what do you do all night?  I walk.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Think and walk.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp  that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (laughs)  Happy shitting.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  My lady.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You weren't at the war council.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I'm not a soldier.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Any advice?  Don't lose.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  If I do, if I fall  don't bring me back.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I'll have to try.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I am not your servant, Jon Snow.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You're in my camp.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 I'm the commander.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I serve the Lord of Light.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I do what he commands.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  How do you know what he commands?  I interpret his signs  as well as I can.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back,  how did I bring you back?  I have no power.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Only what he gives me and he gave me you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Why?  I don't know.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Maybe he brought you here to die again.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  What kind of god would do something like that?  The one we've got.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (horn blowing)  Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes?  You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height  thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  "The height of nobility," "a man of your stature,"  "someone to look up to.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	"  You're all making the same five or six jokes.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - It was a long time ago.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 - It was.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And how have things been going for you since then?  Not so well, I gather.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys  if things had been going well.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I didn't murder the Stark boys.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And he paid for them.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Doesn't seem like it.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He's still alive.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  It was complicated for you, I'm sure,  growing up at Winterfell.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Never quite knowing who you were.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?  You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet  with men to sail them.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  In return, I expect you want me to support  your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?  Not my claim.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 Hers.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And what's wrong with you?  I'm not fit to rule.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We can agree upon that at least.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?  No more than Westeros.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You and I have that in common.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We do.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And both murdered by a usurper as well.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Will their ships be enough?  With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Barely.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  There are and Euron is building more.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He's going to offer them to you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  So why shouldn't I wait for him?  The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He also wants to give you--  His big cock, I think he said.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You won't get one without the other.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?  I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Theon: He murdered our father and would have murdered us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The Seven Kingdoms.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  All of them.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?  Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We ask you to give them back.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  And that's all?  We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two  who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Reasonable.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  What if everyone starts demanding their independence?  She's not demanding, she's asking.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The others are free to ask as well.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They left the world worse than they found it.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We're not going to do that.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We're going to leave the world better than we found it.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms  and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  That's our way of life.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No more.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No more.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (horses nickering)  Do you like games, little man?  Let's play a game.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Run to your brother.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  The sooner you make it to him,  the sooner you get to see him again.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  That's it.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  That's the game.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Easy.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Ready?  Go.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  No, you have to run, remember?  Those are the rules.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!  (grunts)  Hyah! Hyah!  (grunts)  (gasping)  (gasps)  Don't.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Prepare to charge.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Prepare to charge.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - Man: Draw! - Man #2: Draw!  Man #3: Draw!  Man #4: Loose!  Hyah! Hyah!  Go! Go! Follow your commander!  (men shouting)  Run and fight!  (roars)  Hyah!  Man: Nock!  - Draw! - Man #2: Draw!  - Man: Loose! - Man #2: Loose!  - (shouting) - (horse whinnies)  Now.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Karstark: Cavalry, charge!  (groaning)  (horses whinnying)  (shouting)  (horses whinny)  - Nock! - Man: Nock!  - Nock! - Men: Nock!  - Man: Draw! - Man #2: Draw!  - Draw! - Man: Draw!  We'll just kill our own men.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 Stand down.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - Loose! - Men: Loose!  - Get word-- - (grunts)  - (man whimpering) No! - (shouts)  (screams)  (shouting)  (horse whinnies)  (horse whinnies)  Loose!  - Loose! - Men: Loose!  - Loose! - Men: Loose!  (horse whinnies)  (shouts)  We may as well be taking shits back here.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - Follow! - (men shouting)  It's time, go.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - Who owns the North? - Men: We do!  - Who owns the North? - We do!  Show me!  (men shouting)  (yells)  (yells)  Hey!  (grunts)  (men grunt)  Man: Infantry, advance!  (men grunting)  (shouting, grunting)  (screams)  (men shouting)  With me, lads! Break their line!  (screams)  (shouts)  (shouting)  (screams)  (roaring)  Help me!  (men screaming)  (screaming)  (shouting)  - Man: Tormund! - Man #2: Get him back!  Man #2: Infantry, advance.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (men grunting)  Man #3: Both sides!  Fall back!  Fall back!  (grunting continues)  Fuck this, come on!  We're going home!  (gasping)  (shouts)  (gasping)  (shouts)  (gasping continues)  (man screaming)  (gasping)  (shouts)  (gasping)  (grunts)  (roaring)  (grunting)  (horn blowing)  (horn continues)  (shouts)  - (crunches) - (screams)  - (grunts) - (horn continues)  (shouting)  Man: Open the gate!  Man #2: Archers to the wall.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - Their army's gone.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 - Our army's gone.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  We have Winterfell.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They don't have the men for a siege.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	 All we have to do is wait.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  - (banging on gate) - Man: Archers!  To the wall!  (banging)  (Wun Wun roaring)  (men shouting)  (roars)  (groans)  (roars)  (grunts)  You suggested one-on-one combat, didn't you?  I've reconsidered.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (shouts)  (grunting)  (panting)  We're going to bury my brother in the crypt  next to my father.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Jon.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Where is he?  (dogs slurping)  (groaning)  (coughs)  Ah.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Sansa.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Hello, Sansa.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Is this where I'll be staying now?  No.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Our time together is about to come to an end.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  That's all right.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You can't kill me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  I'm part of you now.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Your words will disappear.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Your house will disappear.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Your name will disappear.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  All memory of you will disappear.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (dogs growling)  (growling continues)  (growling continues)  My hounds will never harm me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You haven't fed them in seven days.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  You said it yourself.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (dogs growling)  They're loyal beasts.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  They were.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Now they're starving.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  (dogs growling)  (growling)  Sit.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Down.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	  Down!  Down! Down!  Down!  - (growling, barking) - (Ramsay screaming)  - (crunching, tearing) - (screaming continues)  (screaming continues)   (Chord plays)
s06e10	Winds of Winter	1 (DRAMATIC MUSIC)   (DORAN GRUNTS)  Weak men will never rule Dorne again.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  WALDER: Riverrun is ours.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You let the Blackfish take it from you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Take that castle back.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  He'll never yield, father.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  WALDER: You'll remind him who it was that got married  at the Red Wedding in the first place.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  EDMURE: Command all the forces within the castle  to lay down their arms.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Open the gates.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  PETYR: Your aunt Lyanna  She was already promised to Robert Baratheon.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  SANSA: Father never talked about her.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  PETYR: How many tens of thousands had to die  because Rhaegar chose your aunt.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  SANSA: And then he kidnapped her and raped her.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (WOMAN SCREAMING)  We need friends in Westeros, and we need ships.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  DAENARYS: Our fathers were evil men.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They left the world worse than they found it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We're going to leave the world better than we found it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Your reign is over.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  My reign has just begun.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (DRAGONS SNARLING)  HIGH SPARROW: You've made great progress.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I only pray your grandmother follows your lead,  or I fear for her safety.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Go home.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Find comfort in prayer and good works.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The Mother watches over us all.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  TOMMEN: After conferring with His Holiness, the High Septon,  we have determined that trial by combat  will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell  will stand trial before seven septons  as it was in the earliest days of the faith.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (theme music playing)   (bell tolling)  (tolling continues)  (muttering quietly)  (door opens)  (knocks)  Man: Your Grace.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The trial will be getting under way soon.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You got my money?  Later.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Go away.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (sighs)  Grand Maester.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (whispering)  (crowd murmuring)  (chains rattling)  Ser Loras Tyrell.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Are you prepared to stand trial  and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?  There'll be no need for a trial.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (murmuring)  I confess before the Seven  and freely admit to my crimes.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  To which crimes will you be confessing?  All of them.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I lay with other men  including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (crowd murmuring louder)  I perjured myself before the gods.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I am guilty of depravity  dishonesty,  profligacy,  and arrogance.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I see that now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I humble myself before the Seven  and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The gods' judgment is fierce,  but also fair.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves  beyond the reach of justice.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  But the Mother shows her mercy  to those who kneel before her.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Loras: I take full responsibility for my many sins  and unburden myself of my desires.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  My only remaining wish  is to devote my life to the Seven.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  May I be a living example of their grace  for others to witness.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You understand fully  what this means?  I do.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I will abandon the Tyrell name  and all that goes with it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - (crowd murmuring) - (gasps)  I will never marry  and I will never father children.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  High Sparrow: Brother Loras  I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Will you fight to defend your faith  against heretics and apostates?  I will.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No, I can't let them--  Faith is the way, Father.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (wincing)  All right.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm ready.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I have to go.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 I'm--  I'm late for the trial.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Margaery: You mutilated him.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You gave me your word.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And I have kept my word.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Once the queen mother's trial is concluded,  Brother Loras is free to leave.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And where is the queen mother?  Her litter never left the Red Keep.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Get the others.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Where's the king?  Elsewhere, I'm afraid.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  What's the meaning of this?  I was told that--  ah.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I have more important things to do with my time  than waste them in the presence--  Please, Grand Maester.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 I bear you no ill will.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Please forgive me if you can.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (knife blade rings)  (panting)  This pains me, my lord.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Whatever your faults, you do not deserve  to die alone in such a cold, dark place.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  But sometimes before we can usher in the new,  the old must be put to rest.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - (Pycelle shouts) - (children shouting)  (Pycelle screaming)  The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (groans)  (groaning, panting)  What are you doing?  (crowd whispering)  There's something wrong.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The trial will begin shortly.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Cersei is not here.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Tommen is not here.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Why do you think they're not here?  If the accused is not here,  she will be tried regardless.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We cannot escape the justice of the gods--  Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Cersei understands the consequences of her absence  and she is absent anyway,  which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The trial can wait.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 We all need to leave.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (scoffs)  (grunting)  We all need to leave now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (whispering)  Loras.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Stay with me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (groaning)  (door opens)  (crowd shouting)  Let me through.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Let me through.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (clamoring)  Margaery: Get out of my way.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Let us through.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - (rumbling) - (people murmuring)  (people screaming)  (people scream)  (door closes)  (sputters)  Cersei: Confess.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Confess.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - No.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - Confess.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (sputtering)  (gasps)  Confess.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 It felt good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Beating me, starving me,  frightening me, humiliating me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You did it because it felt good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I understand.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I do things because they feel good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I drink because it feels good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I lie about fucking my brother  because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I killed your High Sparrow  and all his little sparrows  all his septons, all his septas,  all his filthy soldiers,  because it felt good to watch them burn.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No thought has ever given me greater joy.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (chuckles)  Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You've always been quiet.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Do you remember?  Good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm glad to see your face.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm ready to meet the gods.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  What?  Now?  Today?  You're not going to die today.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're not going to die for quite a while.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Ser Gregor.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (armor rattling)  This is Ser Gregor Clegane.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  He's quiet, too.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Your gods have forsaken you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (gasps)  This is your god now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - Shame.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - (sobbing)  - Shame.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - (screaming)  - Shame.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - (screaming continues)  (screaming continues)  Man: I'm very sorry, Your Grace.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Very sorry.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (distant screaming)  (door opens)  (door closes)  Walder: For House Lannister!  Men: Hear me roar!  (cheering)  For House Frey!  We stand together! (cheering)  May we stand together through the centuries,  - good friends to the last.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - (cheering)  And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts,  may we speak the words of our alliance,  "The Freys and the Lannisters  send their regards.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	"  (cheering)  You don't even have to do anything, do you?  You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,  and all the birds come pecking.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - You're welcome to her.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - She doesn't want me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Those two have their eyes on you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (giggling)  They have their eyes on you, cunt.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Not my type.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Not blonde enough?  Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,  hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?  - There you go.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - Maybe I'm not in the mood.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Fuck it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (women laugh)  This came together rather well.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Your father would be pleased.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm sure he would be.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Edmure is back in a cell.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Can't go killing my son by law.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 It wouldn't be right.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Give the family a bad name.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  So the famous Blackfish killed by foot soldiers, eh?  Legendary warrior, everyone said.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?  I'm a bit old for all that.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No, but back in your day.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The purpose of fighting  is defeating your enemies, isn't it?  I've defeated mine.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Now it's mine.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  What do you call that?  Victory.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Yes, you're a great conqueror.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Go on, mock me, boy.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 You think I mind?  The Tullys mocked me for years.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The Starks mocked me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Where are they now?  You talk about war as if you're an expert,  but the one battle I remember you fighting,  you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  But it doesn't matter.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Here we are now, two kingslayers.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces  and snigger behind our backs.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We don't mind, do we?  Fear is a marvelous thing.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They don't fear the Freys, though.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They fear the Lannisters.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If we have to ride north and take them back for you  every time you lose them,  why do we need you?  Show me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Your Grace, there's no need--  Show me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?  As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option,  perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?  He should be with his grandfather,  his brother, his sister.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Burn him  and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (horse whinnies)  Whoa, whoa.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (birds cawing)  Hello.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm--  I'm to be the new maester.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Oh.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  According to our records,  Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  He died.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  He's since passed away.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Which is why I'm here.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  This is irregular.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Follow me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No women or children.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (door closes)  (door opens)  (door closes)  (cawing)  - (distant chatter) - (distant metal clanging)  When we had feasts,  our family would sit up here  and I'd sit down there.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Could have been worse, Jon Snow.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You had a family.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You had feasts.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (chuckles)  Aye, you're right.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 I was luckier than most.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  What is that?  Tell him.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Tell him who it belonged to.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The Princess Shireen.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Tell him what you did to her.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Tell him!  We burned her at the stake.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Why?  The army was trapped.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 The horses were dying.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - It was the only way.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - You burned a little girl alive!  I only do what my Lord commands.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We are standing here because of him.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I loved that girl like she was my own.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  She was good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 She was kind.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 And you killed her!  So did her father.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  So did her mother.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Her own blood knew it was the only way.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The only way for what?  They all died anyway.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You told everyone Stannis was the one.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You had him believing it, all of them fooled.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - And you lied.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - I didn't lie.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I was wrong.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Aye, you were wrong.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  How many died because you were wrong?  I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  She admits to the crime.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Do you have anything to say for yourself?  I've been ready to die for many years.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You know the great war is still to come.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And you know I can help you win that war.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Ride south today.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If you return to the North,  I'll have you hanged as a murderer.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If you ever come back this way,  I will execute you myself.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm having the lord's chamber prepared for you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Mother and Father's room?  You should take it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm not a Stark.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You are to me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're the Lady of Winterfell.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You deserve it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 We're standing here because of you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They came because of you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - He did.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - And you trust him?  (chuckles) Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I should have told you about him,  about the Knights of the Vale.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm sorry.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We need to trust each other.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We have so many enemies now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Jon.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  A raven came from the Citadel.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  A white raven.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Winter is here.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Well, Father always promised, didn't he?  The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,  he was assassinated.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  100 red scorpions, was it?  You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You murder your own prince,  but you expect me to trust you?  We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You came to Dorne because you needed our help.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  What is your name again?  Barbaro?  - (chuckles) - Obara.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Obara.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 You look like an angry little boy.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Don't presume to tell me what I need.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Forgive my sister.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--  Do shut up, dear.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Anything from you?  No? Good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Let the grown women speak.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They have declared war on Dorne.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Cersei stole the future from me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  She killed my son.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  She killed my grandson.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  She killed my granddaughter.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Survival is not what I'm after now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're absolutely right.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I chose the wrong words.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It is not survival I offer.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It is your heart's desire.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (rings)  And what is my heart's desire?  Vengeance.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Justice.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (footsteps)  Fire and blood.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Your ships are nearly ready.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I saw them painting the sails.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're not coming with us.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  New strategy?  You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast?  If we take Casterly Rock,  the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're not going to Westeros.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're staying here with the Second Sons.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  There's finally peace in Meereen.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Fuck Meereen.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Fuck the people.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm here for you, not them.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You promised me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  "My sword is yours.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 My life is yours.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	"  This is what I command.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If I'm going to rule in Westeros,  I'll need to make alliances.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The best way to make alliances is with marriage.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Who are you marrying this time?  I don't know.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Maybe no one.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table?  Are you a queen or fish bait?  I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  A king wouldn't think twice about it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  So that's what you want? To be my mistress?  I'm not proud.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 I don't care what perfumed aristocrat  sits beside you in the throne room.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I don't want a crown.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 I want you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I love you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And I make you happy.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You know I do.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Bring me with you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Let me fight for you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I can't.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The dwarf told you to do this?  No one tells me to do anything.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Clever fellow.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 Can't argue with his logic.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm no use to you over there.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Don't get angry.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm not angry.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 I'm full of self-pity.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Who comes after you?  Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?  A great number of women, I imagine.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Specific orders will be left for you  regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Bay of Dragons?  We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?  You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I hope it brings you happiness.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I pity the lords of Westeros.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They have no idea what's coming for them.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Farewell, Daario Naharis.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (footsteps)  How did he take it?  No tears.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I know it was hard for you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You turned away a man who truly loves you  because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler,  if it's any consolation.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It's not.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No, I suppose not.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm terrible at consoling.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Yes, you really are.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening?  You have your armies, you have your ships,  you have your dragons.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Everything you've ever wanted  since you were old enough to want anything,  it's all yours for the taking.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Are you afraid?  Good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're in the great game now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And the great game's terrifying.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The only people who aren't afraid of failure  are madmen like your father.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Do you know what frightens me?  I said farewell to a man who loves me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  A man I thought I cared for.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And I felt nothing.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Just impatient to get on with it.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  He wasn't the first to love you  and he won't be the last.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Well, you have completely failed to console me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  For what it's worth, I've been a cynic  for as long as I can remember.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Everyone's always asking me to believe in things--  family, gods, kings, myself.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It was often tempting  until I saw where belief got people.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  So I said no, thank you to belief.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And yet here I am.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I believe in you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It's embarrassing, really.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'd swear you my sword,  but I don't actually own a sword.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It's your counsel I need.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It's yours.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Now and always.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I, um  I had something made for you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm not sure if it's right.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Tyrion Lannister,  I name you Hand of the Queen.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're not one of mine, are you?  No, my lord.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Didn't think so.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Too pretty.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Where are my damn moron sons?  Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They're here, my lord.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?  Tell them to come here now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  But they're already here, my lord.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Here, my lord.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  They weren't easy to carve.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Especially Black Walder.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (breathing heavily) What  My name is Arya Stark.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I want you to know that.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The last thing you're ever going to see  is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (knife blade rings)  (groaning)  Forgive me, my lady  if you're at prayer.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm done with all that.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I came here every day when I was a girl.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I prayed to be somewhere else.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Back then I only thought about what I wanted,  never about what I had.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I was a stupid girl.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You were a child.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  What do you want?  I thought you knew what I wanted.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I was wrong.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  No, you weren't.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Every time I'm faced with a decision,  I close my eyes and see the same picture.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself  will this action help to make this picture a reality?  Pull it out of my mind  and into the world?  And I only act if the answer is yes.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  A picture of me on the Iron Throne  and you by my side.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It's a pretty picture.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  It's never stopped you from serving yourself.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The past is gone for good.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You can sit here mourning its departure  or you can prepare for the future.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You, my love,  are the future of House Stark.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Who should the North rally behind?  A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark  born here at Winterfell  or a motherless bastard born in the south?  This is where I leave you.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're not coming with us?  The Wall is not just ice and stone.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Ancient spells were carved into its foundations.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Strong magic  to protect men from what lies beyond.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And while it stands, the dead cannot pass.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I cannot pass.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Where will you go?  The great war is coming  and I still fight for the living.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'll do what I can  as long as I can.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Thank you, Uncle Benjen.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I wish you both good fortune.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Are you sure you're ready for this?  I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I have to be ready for this.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (woman screaming)  Woman: Ned?  Lyanna.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Is that you?  Is that really you?  You're not a dream?  No, I'm not a dream.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm here.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Right here.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I've missed you, big brother.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I've missed you, too.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I want to be brave.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Shh.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You are.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I'm not.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I don't want to die.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You're not going to die.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Get her some water.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - No, no water.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 - Is there a maester?  Listen to me, Ned.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (whispering)  If Robert finds out, he'll--  you know he will.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You have to protect him.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Promise me, Ned.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Promise me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (baby crying)  Promise me, Ned.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Promise me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You can't expect Knights of the Vale  to side with wildling invaders.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We didn't invade.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	 We were invited.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Not by me.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The free folk, the northerners,  and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely,  fought together, and we won.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  My father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The Boltons are defeated.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The war is over.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Winter has come.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The war is not over.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And I promise you, friend,  the true enemy won't wait out the storm.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  He brings the storm.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (men murmuring)  Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,  but you refused the call.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover,  but in their hour of greatest need,  you refused the call.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  And you, Lord Cerwyn,  your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Still you refused the call.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  But House Mormont remembers.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The North remembers.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I don't care if he's a bastard.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  He's my king from this day until his last day.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (men murmuring)  Lady Mormont speaks harshly  and truly.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (men murmuring)  My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I didn't commit my men to your cause  'cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  But I was wrong.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  - (men murmur) - Manderly: He is the White Wolf.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  The King in the North.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (murmuring)  I did not fight beside you on the field  and I will regret that until my dying day.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  A man can only admit when he was wrong  and ask forgiveness.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  There's nothing to forgive, my lord.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  There will be more fights to come.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  House Glover will stand behind House Stark  as we have for a thousand years.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (men murmur)  And I will stand behind Jon Snow  the King in the North!  - The King in the North! - (cheering)  All: The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  (chanting fades)  Man: Company halt!  Halt!  Halt!  Come on.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister  First of Her Name,  Queen of the Andals and the First Men,  Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Qyburn: Long may she reign.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  Crowd: Long may she reign.
s06e10	Winds of Winter	  (choir singing)  (men shouting)  (choir continues)  (men shouting)  (screeches)  (screeching)  (dragons screeching)  (screeching)  (dragon screeches)
s07e00	The Story So Far	1 Welcome to Westeros,  where the fight for the kingdom is on.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Anyone can die.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Which is fine.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Where great families live and die for the Iron Throne.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're all weaving these tangled webs.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Some are noble.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Jon Snow's everybody's hero.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Some are not.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - If you're gonna be bad, be really bad.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - I want my crown!  So many kings and queens in waiting.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's about power and greed.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But an icy foe may well end them all.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When's it start?  Season seven is coming and so are the dragons.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  So let's burn through the epic saga to date.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This is what Game of Thrones does, it  - it sucks you in.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - With Game of Thrones: The Story So Far.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  There is no middle ground.
s07e00	The Story So Far	   As season one opens, it's the calm before the storm.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  King Robert Baratheon rules from the capital King's Landing  but his days are numbered.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  To be king in Westeros, you sit on the Iron Throne in King's Landing  and you're ruling over the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Start the damn joust before I piss meself!  He's locked in a loveless marriage  and only chose his queen for her family's name  to hold his kingdom together.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I'm very sympathetic to Cersei.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 She was completely in love with him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 she was in awe of him almost,  and he turned into this almost semi abusive drunk.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Our marriage.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This unhappy couple have three golden haired children to their name  but Cersei keeps a deadly secret from Robert.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The children are not his.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The truth will be discovered on a royal trip north  and it's here that our story really begins.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The King has asked his old ally Ned Stark to help him rule.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ned and his wife Catelyn govern the north.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Fiercely loyal to the crown.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Starks stand for loyalty, integrity bravery.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They are really the moral compass of the show.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're the good guys and they're the ones  that you find yourself rooting for from the start.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The couple have five children:  three sons and two daughters  and the decimation of this happy family  will reverberate throughout our tale.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're almost too innocent for that world.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  King Robert arrives with his Queen Cersei  and with them is the whole Lannister clan.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  That's Jamie Lannister.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 The Queen's twin brother.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Oh, the Lannisters.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're blonde they're beautiful they're arrogant,  so fuck them.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And it's really the Lannisters who were going to introduce  a lot of trouble into the lives of the Starks from this point.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The arrival of the Lannisters into that world  totally sends shock waves through the whole family.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Bran Stark goes climbing one day,  gets to the top of the tower  and discovers the Lannister's deepest, dark secret.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The secret is that Cersei the queen  is actually sleeping with her brother Jaime.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Lannisters, oh god!  They are.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I have never seen a family.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 I mean talk about dysfunctional.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Stop! Stop.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's incest which even in Westeros is generally frowned upon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It also means that King Robert's children  are not actually his children.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - It's alright, it's alright.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - He saw us!  I heard you the first time.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He knows what it means too, and he knows that  if the incest is discovered, not only will  he and his sister be put to death  but their three children may very well too.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so for Jaime Lannister,  the greatest swordsman in Westeros,  there's only one solution.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The things I do for love.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Here's a convenient way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The kid'll die,  it'll look like he fell  and our kids will be safe.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  First in a coma,  Bran will later awake with no memory of how he fell  or what he saw.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Royal secret is safe for now  and only the viewer has seen what the Lannisters will do to keep it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Everything went pear shaped after that and really  that's the whole chain of events starting.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  King Robert still wants Ned down in the capital,  so this will be the last ever time  we see the Stark family all together.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  A family which includes Ned's son out of wedlock,  the bastard Jon Snow.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ned must now leave his family  and follow King Robert south  taking his daughters Sansa and Arya with him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The reason I think that the first season of Game of Thrones works,  is it's essentially about this good family  that just wants to essentially be left alone  and serve their king and their country.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This good family is ripped apart  and thrown into situations that they never anticipated.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They are bound for the capital, King's Landing  where Ned's new task will be to protect King Robert  from those who would unseat him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And in season one,  viewers learned the greatest enemies live in exile overseas.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Targaryens.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They were dethroned by King Robert in the last war.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The only surviving members of the family  are a brother and sister called Viserys and Daenerys.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The siblings are the children of the Mad King who was killed in war.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Viserys dominates his younger sister.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Viserys has more than a touch of the Targaryen madness  and you know sometimes he's protecting her  but he's also trying to treat her as a,  - as a bargaining chip.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Come forward my dear.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In search of an army,  Viserys makes a pact with a savage tribe, the Dothraki.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Offering his beautiful young sister  in marriage to their leader, Khal Drogo.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's the only bargaining chip he has;  he doesn't have any wealth anymore; he doesn't have any armies,  but he has her who he can trade to this horse lord.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I would let his whole tribe fuck you,  all 40,000 men, and their horses too,  if that's what it took.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's power-hungry but to a nasty degree.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He doesn't really care how or by what means,  he just wants to be important and looked up to.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But his plans backfire.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Daenerys and Khal Drogo fall in love  and become quite the power couple.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Suddenly she finds herself with Khal Drogo empowered.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  People are obeying her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He completely underestimates not only Danny but Khal Drogo.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What's he saying?  He says yes.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You shall have  a golden crown.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's a real coming-of-age story throughout the first season.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She really grows into herself.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Look away Khaleesi.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - No.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This is one of the turning points for Daenerys.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think this is when you realize that  she's prepared to sacrifice anything for the greater good.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Crown for king.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He was revolting.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He was utterly, utterly revolting,  and that was the moment that she escaped  from her shell.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 When she became the woman  and not the kowtowed girl.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And as the Targaryens grow in power,  we learn that King Robert faces another challenge  to his northernmost borders.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Threats which led past rulers  to build this giant wall of ice to keep out wild things beyond.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's protected by the legendary Night's Watch.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Night's Watch are a small army  who guard the northern border of the country.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In season one, there's lots of fighting for the throne  but actually in the background there are these creatures  appearing north of the Wall  that nobody has seen for thousands of years  and no one quite wants to believe  that they're there but they certainly are.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We hear the characters saying that this is all folklore  or that this is all made up,  but for the viewer we see that basically  these characters do exist.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 They are there.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think the White Walkers are really terrifying  mostly because you're not 100% sure,  you know what they're capable of doing  or what their motives are.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They are a serious threat.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In season one, in search of a purpose,  Jon Snow ventures to the Wall and joins the Night's Watch,  a leader in the making.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Jon Snow's everybody's hero,  Jon Snow's one of my favorite characters.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 He's the dude.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's also in search of answers.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The question of Jon  Jon Snow's parentage has been one of the burning topics  amongst not only the show's fans but book fans for many decades.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Jon Snow is Ned Stark's bastard son.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He brought him back from a war  and we never really learned who the mother is.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Understandably Catelyn, Ned's wife,  isn't too fond of Jon for that reason.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Try as she may she could never make peace with that,  with the fact that Ned was, unfaithful.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But down in the capital King's Landing,  Ned Stark has a much greater challenge to face.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  His daughter has fallen for Prince Joffrey.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's presented with marrying the future king,  live in a beautiful castle, go to banquets,  have beautiful dresses to wear.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 A fairy tale story.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ned has discovered the Queen and her brother are lovers  and this will be his family's undoing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When the King returns from his hunt I'll tell him the truth.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You must be gone by then,  you and your children.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I will not have their blood on my hands.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But before he gets the chance to talk to King Robert,  King Robert gets himself killed on a hunting trip.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Joffrey is now king, and without Robert to protect him  Ned is tried for treason.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He confesses, believing it will save his daughter,  but misjudges the new ruler.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's been stuck up in the north too long  and has no idea how the real world operates,  how to really deal with the kind of  the politics of Westeros.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Bring me his head!  That's when you realize nobody is safe in this world at all.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When I saw Sean Bean pushed down  that was the only scene that really has brought a tear to my eye.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's cruel, it's heartbreaking,  but there's a point to the children witnessing this.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  If they want to survive they have to start to be resilient.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They have to learn from this.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It was at that moment you realize  what Game of Thrones was really about.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's here that the Stark family splinters.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Arya is whisked away by a Night's Watch brother loyal to Ned,  leaving Sansa at the mercy of Joffrey.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Robb Stark reacts with murderous rage  to the news that his father has been beheaded.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Robb's the heir and he's not only picking up his father's mantle  as Lord of Winterfell,  but he's picking up a much older mantle.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The crown that no one has worn for 300 years,  the kingdom of the north.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It will lead to all-out war between the Starks and the Lannisters  who were led by its patriarch Tywin Lannister.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Tywin Lannister is one of the great warriors  and battle strategists of the age.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As well as his twins, Cersei and Jaime,  he has a son he despises, Tyrion, known as the Imp.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You're wounded.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Good of you to notice.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Tyrion obviously is just brilliant.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - I hear we won.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Stereotypes of what  a hero should be or should look like in Game of Thrones  are just completely blown out the window,  because we've got Tyrion who, you know,  doesn't look like your archetypal hero, but he is.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As war rages in Westeros,  over the Narrow Sea, Daenerys loses a husband  but gains astonishing new powers.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She walks into Khal Drogo's funeral pyre  with fossilized dragon's eggs.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What an epic scene.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Season one ends with the sight of Daenerys  emerging from a fire, unscathed with her dragons hatched.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  These creatures are extraordinary creatures  the likes of which have not been seen in hundreds of years.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  'Blood of my blood.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	'  You see these, these three dragons around her and you're, just, like,  they're gonna be awesome when they're grown.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The innocence is gone, she's it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's the force now.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As the dragons are born she comes more and more into her own  - until the power becomes innate to her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - It's about a new era.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The whole first season is essentially  the old era dying out; the new era beginning  and by the end she has a sense that  she knows that she's bound for greatness.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And after the break, watch those dragons grow in season two.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Welcome back to Game of Thrones: The Story So Far,  where season two marks a new reign of tyranny  in the capital, King's Landing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Joffrey is brutalizing his subjects  as well as his bride-to-be Sansa Stark.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You can't!  What did you say?  Sansa has learned some painful lessons along the way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The chivalrous knights and gallant princes  that she dreamed of, she.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 she got a gallant prince  and he turned out to be Joffrey.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Killing you would send your brother a message.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's a prisoner in the worst place imaginable,  enduring all kinds of psychological and  sometimes physical abuse from these captors.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Leave her face.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I like her pretty.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's a bully,  and we don't like bullies.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And you.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's the product of a brother and sister shagging,  so like you know this might be why he isn't all there mentally.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Cersei's smart enough to realize that Joffrey is  perhaps not what she might have hoped for  and he's getting out of her control now  and he's a danger in part even to her  and even to other members of the family.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What you just did,  is punishable by death.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Joffrey's enemies are everywhere.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Chief amongst them and just across the bay at Dragonstone  is Stannis, brother of the late King Robert,  who believes the throne should be his.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Stannis has learned that Robert's children are Lannister bastards  which means that it is Stannis who is next in line.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  So Stannis Baratheon, who knows that  King Joffrey is the product of incest,  decides to send ravens out to all the corners of the Seven Kingdoms  letting them know the Lannister secret.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In order to claim the throne,  Stannis enlists the red priestess, Melisandre,  who was on her own mission to find the right ruler for Westeros.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She believes Stannis is the savior of the world, basically.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's supposed to be on the Iron Throne  and her magical powers have no limits, I think.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  There's there's so much that we don't know that she can do.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  However, Stannis isn't the only one after the throne.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  His younger brother, Renly also believes he has a claim  and so war is inevitable.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Iron Throne is mine by right.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  All those that deny that are my foes.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They both think they should be king  but I'm on Stannis' side, so screw Renly.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Rather than fight it out on the battlefield,  Stannis finds another way to kill his brother.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I guess family ties don't mean an awful lot in Westeros.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The powerful sorcery of the red priestess is revealed  when she gives birth to a sinister weapon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The shadow baby is basically just a way to kill Renly  and it comes out of me in a great way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think Melisandre, she's always lived by this religion.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  If she's got something to do she's gonna do it  and she's not gonna let other people stand in her way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What I think's brilliant about Game of Thrones,  he lives in a fantasy world, it's a completely realistic  depiction of how power works.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What power does to people, what people do to get power  and what happens when they fall short,  when they miss the mark.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  That's why it's so brilliant.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When Renly is murdered, he leaves behind his widow, Margaery Tyrell  who belongs to the Tyrell family  who are very rich and powerful in their own right.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Calling yourself king doesn't make you one  and if Renly wasn't a king I wasn't a queen.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Margaery is an absolute piece of work.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You know she wants power.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Do you want to be a queen?  No.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I want to be the queen.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Across the Narrow Sea,  Daenerys Targaryen is learning valuable lessons  in her quest to return to Westeros and seize the throne.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's desperate to be a good ruler.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  That she can, you know, go to bed at night saying  I think I'm doing things the right way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As Daenerys' power grows, so do her dragons  but as news of their existence spreads,  they become highly sought after.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When she's in Qarth,  everybody's kind of think "Who are you?  We'll just take your dragons.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We'll take your dragons and you're not powerful anymore.
s07e00	The Story So Far	"  Dracarys!  People have underestimated her, the whole way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And it is in season two,  that we finally see the dragons kill for Daenerys.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As Daenerys gets stronger in exile,  Jon Snow and the Night's Watch are on a mission beyond the Wall  where the true scale of the threat to the kingdom is revealed.
s07e00	The Story So Far	   Blown the horn.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 When will he come?  The army of the dead is on its way  and it's gonna kick off sooner or later  and really you know they've got to get out of there  - as fast as they possibly can.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - One blast for friends,  two for foes.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And three for White Walkers.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The threat of winter coming is very much a myth  to the people of the south.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're not really taking it seriously.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They don't know about the undead and  all the horrors that are coming towards them.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  So what we learn in season two  is that the White Walkers are very much real.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're nothing like we've ever seen before in television.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're not just zombies, they're not just statues, they're walking  ice cubes, basically.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're, they're really bad and they're, really scary  and it's literally, I think it's got to be a fight of Ice and Fire.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We have all these kingdoms wanting to fight for the throne  and they think that that is what ultimately the battle is about  but really at the end of the day, they're not looking  at what's the real problem here and it's the White Walkers.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And it's in season two in King's Landing,  where we see that Tyrion may just be an asset to the war  when Stannis launches an attack on the city.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I'll lead the attack!  Battle of Blackwater was his moment.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He was the best person to speak to the people of King's Landing  and to get them to protect their, their.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 their.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 their city  because he knows what it's like to fight,  he knows what it's like to have your back up against the wall.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Those are brave men knocking at our door.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Let's go kill them!  Tyrion manages to get the troops fired up  by giving a good speech and  fired up then heads out with them to fight Stannis on the bay.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He doesn't last very long,  he gets knocked out after a couple of minutes.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Tyrion is upstaged by his father Tywin  who arrives with his own massive army bolstered by the Tyrells  who've now firmly joined the cause.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's that moment where you really see  where power lies.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's not in the king,  it's in the person behind the king.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The battle is over.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We have won!  And so season 2 ends with the Lannisters victorious.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  After the break, season 3 brings more terrible losses for the Starks  when they attend a cataclysmic wedding.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Welcome back to The Story So Far.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Where as season three begins,  Daenerys has set sail on a mission.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She and her dragons may have grown in power and stature  but securing an army still eludes her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  So she ventures to a place where she can buy one.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She knows she needs an army, a powerful army too,  if she ever wants to reclaim the Westerosi throne  and the best bet for that are the Unsullied.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I have dragons.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - I'll give you one.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - She appears to want to trade  the dragon for slaves.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She seems to have made this daft agreement  to give away her best dragon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She hands over the dragon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Next thing you know once she's got control of the Unsullied    Then it's very easy to say to the dragon  who still will listen to her and not to him,  - burn him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Dracarys!  Because you would take power if you have the force of a dragon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're pretty impressive creatures.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's been the mother of dragons  and knew she was destined for greatness  but now she really is a queen with an army.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  To then see that she has thousands of people  on her team and then you get like this swoop past.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's got these, like fire-breathing mythical creatures  that are just gonna tear shit up.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As this young Targaryen gains followers,  in King's Landing a young Tyrell is gaining influence.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Margaery has replaced Sansa in Joffrey's affections,  a reward for her family's military support at Blackwater.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and  watch something die over there.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Marjorie is a woman who's on top of the game,  she's controlling where she's going,  she's a proper feminist icon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But the Tyrell's ambitions  are not going down well with Cersei Lannister.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Alana is a matriarch of the family  and she advises her granddaughter  on how best to play the political game  so that she might take power in King's Landing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  To make matters worse,  her soul mate Jaime is a prisoner of war.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He is held first by Brienne of Tarth,  then both are captured by a northern faction.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Looks like your woman's getting the better of you.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This is all bundled up in  when Jaime begins to start thinking about other people.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  His efforts to stop Brienne being raped  are the beginning of that.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You know who she is, don't you?  It's good when those little  bits of goodness come in those characters that are so devilish,  as well just give you a little light in there.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight  in sapphires  if she's returned to him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I mean of course it being Game of Thrones it doesn't get him anywhere.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Another one of those Game of Thrones moments  which has so much more going on in it  than just him losing his hand.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's the greatest swordsman in Westeros we're told,  so he can't do that anymore.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's now made a good friend in her  and he's seen a lot of things and  I'm sure he's questioning what being a Lannister is about as well.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Yet without his hand,  we see Jaime Lannister at his most heroic.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The heartless knight who pushed Bran Stark from the tower  finds new honor in Season 3.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's left, he's left her behind,  he's abandoned her  and he's on his way to King's Landing and then,  then his captors mentioned that,  what's gonna happen to her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Nice bear!  And then he decides to return and save her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And it is in season three that we witness the fearsome work  of another powerful family, the Bolton's,  who are scheming to take control of the north.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think the Bolton's want pretty much what everyone else seems to want.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's power and status.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Kill me!  You're no good to me dead.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We need you.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ramsay, a bastard son of the family,  enjoys torturing his enemies  including Theon Greyjoy  who he took prisoner when sacking Winterfell after Ned's demise.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Historically, the Bolton's have always been just  just under the Starks, kind of the Starks  have always been on top of them, so I think  they feel that now is their time to rise.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's unbelievable what Ramsay is capable of doing to people.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Reek!  He's just all about the mind,  he's all about making you doubt yourself,  he's all about getting in there and making you insecure  and making you feel like you  can't go up against him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Another hostage at large in season three  is Arya Stark, kidnapped by the Hound.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The disgraced knight plans to find Arya's family  and trade her for cash.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Remember what happens to children who run.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  One of the great double acts of Game of Thrones  is the Hound and Arya.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Don't!  - Don't kill him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - There's something so  perversely magical about that pairing,  sort of warped mentor-protÃ©gÃ© relationship that develops.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In his desire to claim a ransom,  the Hound heads for the Twins  where he knows Arya's mother and brother,  Catelyn and Robb Stark,  are attending a wedding.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Twins is a strategic river crossing  controlled by the Frey family  and the Starks need them onside for their war effort.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Walder Frey is a very bitter nasty old man  who controls a small but significant area in the kingdom.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  If he's been let down by Robb Stark  after this promise,  if he shows any kind of forgiveness  or, just let it go, we didn't want to marry my daughters,  marry someone else, he would lose face,  in that world, it's a vicious world he's operating in.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Stark family offer Robb's uncle to make amends  and are here for that wedding,  a terrible mistake.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Catelyn in her heart  knew that you do not break a promise if you are the king of the north  and also you certainly don't break it to Walder Frey.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Your grace  He's probably laid awake for nights  just planning it and timing it and working out  just how it's gonna work out.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The moment when Cat sees that  Roose Bolton is wearing chainmail  is a powerful moment.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Why would you wear chain mail to a wedding,  and what is the purpose of chain mail,  it's to prevent you getting killed.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Robb! - Even though I'd read the scripts,  the Red Wedding still completely,  was shocking and I was still screaming at the TV,  "Don't do it, no don't, don't", you just don't want it to happen.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Red Wedding is the event that  pretty much decimates an entire generation of the Stark family.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Within the Game of Thrones,  Walder Frey's not playing the Game of Thrones.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's not attempting to be the king.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's actually perfectly happy with what he's got.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He has his own little fiefdom  and he's all sitting in the chair watching terrible things.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's a rotter isn't he.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's absolutely rotten.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Grim.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Lannisters send their regards.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It is an ambush backed by Tywin Lannister.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Robb was such an amazing character  and you kind of want him to be the king  and to win.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's the cruelty of it  and it's the relishing of it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Everything goes to hell at the Red Wedding.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Arya stark arrives at the Twins  to witness her brother's desecrated body  and loses any last shred of innocence.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's there.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 She's there at the Red Wedding, she's outside  and she was so close,  you know she was so close to seeing them again, she was so close.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The path that she goes on,  she learns to become stronger and fight  and also she is after revenge.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And when she comes across her family's killers later  You little shit.
s07e00	The Story So Far	   she matches their brutality.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's had to go over to the dark side,  that's what makes her interesting.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In order to survive in that world,  you've got to match what is given you.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so by the end of season 3,  all the elder Starks have gone from the Game of Thrones.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Only the children remain,  orphaned and scattered across Westeros,  including Bran Stark, still paralyzed from his fall.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's fled Winterfell with a loyal band of followers heading north.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  So Hodor we know as  - a very loyal character.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - It's all right, Hodor.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He lost the use of his legs and Hodor's the person that  carries him around and takes him everywhere.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Being the big giant of a man that he is.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's all right.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The wolves will protect him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Him and his brother Rickon are the two last  male heirs to, to the, to the Stark household  and yet it's fast depleting.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We're running out of Starks.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Bran Stark is very much on his own journey  to discover the roots of this ancient magic  that's reappearing in the kingdom throughout the seasons.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And yet amid this loss comes a small victory.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Unlikely hero Samwell Tarly  stumbles on a weakness of the White Walkers.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Samwell reaches for all he has to hand,  an old dragonglass spear he once found in the ground.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  To his astonishment it, it works.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The spells are shattered and it's melting before him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And stay with us to see wedded bliss vanish, after the break.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's choking!  Welcome back to Game of Thrones: The Story So Far.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We're in season four, a Royal Wedding in King's Landing  unites two great houses of Westeros,  the Tyrells and the Lannisters.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Margaery and Joffrey's wedding  is one of those weddings  that we all have to go to where there's no love in the room.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The wedding brings another great family into the game.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Martel's, represented by Prince Oberyn.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We're the hottest couple at the wedding  What else is there to say?  - Ellaria Sand.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - My lord.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 My lady.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Charming.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - He has a zest for life,  and all the beautiful things that the world has to offer.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  None of it is as beautiful as his own rage  and taste for revenge.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Oberyn is seeking vengeance for his sister's brutal death  - at the hands of the Lannisters.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Rape and murder  of women and children is considered distasteful.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Joffrey really uses the wedding as an excuse  - to be as horrible as he can.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Uncle,  he can be my cup bearer.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He sees it as an opportunity to wield his power because he can.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And you're dying for something to happen to him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so an unseen hand poisons the newly wed King.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Idiots, help your king.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Move away!  It's the moment of retribution that the whole of the Seven Kingdoms  - have been waiting for.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Geoffrey!  I think everybody who watches Game of Thrones  was hoping this day would come.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I wanted to kill him in such a way  that the viewers were reminded that here's a  13 year old boy who's dying.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Though it is actually the Tyrells that have poisoned Joffrey,  it is Tyrion who is blamed.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This is really the point where Tyrion's fragile bonds  with his family begin to unravel.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Take him!  Take Him!  Take Him!  In plot terms, the death of Joffrey  is another shaking of the board where the pieces are scattered  and also it's one of those things that  elevate the whole series from merely a story into a saga.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As the royal family grows weaker,  news from Westeros reaches Meereen  where Daenerys has conquered the city,  but she is not yet ready to capitalize on her enemy's weakness.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Murdered at his own wedding.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This would appear to be a really good time  for her to finally make her play for the Iron Throne.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She has the dragons and she has the army,  and she has the strength of character.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But actually she has new responsibilities now,  when she has unfinished business where she is,  and she's still trying to learn how to rule.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And to compound matters, her dragons have grown so big  that Daenerys has started to lose control of them.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  No!  As they get bigger, as her power increases,  the harder it is for her to manage.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And that's where the story then has to go.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  All they're going to bring is complexity.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And when one of the dragons kills a child and abandons her,  Daenerys is left with no other choice  but to chain the other two.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's just locked up her dragons, so  can she unleash them again, and will they forgive her?  Without the mighty force of her dragons,  Daenerys is faced with a dilemma  as to what to do next.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's definitely going through a sort of  a dark night of the soul, I think,  where she's trying to determine,  have I got what it takes.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so in season four, as Daenerys remains in exile,  across the Narrow Sea,  Sansa Stark has fled the capital  and taken refuge with her aunt Lysa,  who has been seduced by an arch schemer.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Littlefinger is playing a very chaotic game  and he thrives on that.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Oh, my sweet wife.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  For Littlefinger, it's all about getting power I think,  and using Lysa as a pawn along the way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Sansa has witnessed Lysa's murder,  and covers for Littlefinger.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Sansa's one of these pure characters who's been  mistreated all through the series.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's seen a lot of horrible, horrible things happen  and she's never been able to take control  and this is the first time.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 Actually, she's got nothing else to lose.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When Sansa lied  to protect Littlefinger, I cheered.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 I thought thank God girl.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He tried to reason with her,  promised her she was the only one he'd ever loved but  she stepped through those doors.
s07e00	The Story So Far	.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What you discover, is that she's been learning this entire time.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's been listening, she's been watching.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's been taking Littlefinger's lessons to heart.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  So from one Stark protÃ©gÃ© to another,  Sansa's sister Arya is still the Hound's hostage  but they're now on an equal footing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Who would pass the bloody gate?  The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's her captor but he's also her protector  and you know she's seen his own pain  and his own fear at times and  they've shared some dangerous situations.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But when The Hound is gravely injured in battle,  Arya is forced to strike out on her own.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Fuck it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 I'm ready.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Now he's wounded and he's dying  and she's remembering all he said about mercy  and he's asking for mercy  and by mercy he means, you know, a quick thrust to kill him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And she doesn't give it to him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Kill me.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She won't put him out of his misery,  she won't give him the easy way out,  she's going to leave him there to suffer.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Another wandering Stark is Arya's crippled brother, Bran,  who has made it north of the Wall  in search of the three-eyed Raven  who he believes will help him walk again.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  All the time aided by his loyal traveling companion, Hodor.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think Hodor's more than just Bran's legs.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think he means a lot to Bran, you know, someone  he's always been there through absolutely everything, you know,  even though he can't speak, he can only say one word,  he's always someone that's looking after them.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You know, in a world of evil,  he's probably one of the only good ones.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Clearly Bran is very important because he's trekked  all the way up north to a cave where this, this raven  has been summoning him for the past couple of seasons, and  now he's in this cave with the three-eyed raven.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Really we're gonna find out  what, what the grand scheme of things is for Bran.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You'll never walk again.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But you will fly.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  His powers, he's getting stronger and there's gonna be some  really exciting things happening  and we're gonna find out more and more about him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  At the Wall, the Night's Watch suffers  a huge wildling attack at Castle Black,  but in season four they get a powerful new ally.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Stannis Baratheon, who's been away licking his wounds  after the Blackwater defeat, joins them with his vast army.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Battle of the Blackwater was a huge  and crushing defeat at the end of season two  and it's taken them basically two seasons  to sort of rebuild from that,  and his arrival means that Jon Snow could have a new ally  in the battle against the White Walkers beyond the Wall.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  If my father had seen the things that I've seen,  he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  All of them.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Season four draws to a mighty climax in King's Landing  when the ultimate father-and-son showdown comes to a head.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Tyrion is tried for murder.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I'm guilty of being a dwarf.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - You're not on trial for being a dwarf.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Oh, yes I am.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I've been on trial for that my entire life.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's put on trial for a murder he doesn't commit.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  His father deserts him and betrays him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I demand a trial by combat!  I mean, trial by combat, you can get someone  to fight for your honor, so whether you're wrong or not,  as long as they win the fight that's what matters.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He names Oberyn Martell as his champion.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The one thing that he's ever lived for,  is to avenge his sister's death  and he knows that now that the opportunity is presenting itself,  there is no question that he will get what he wants.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You killed her children!  And he does get what he wants by  forcing a confession out of him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's not exactly how he expected it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I killed her children.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He still technically got what he wanted, you know.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Then I raped her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Then I smashed her head in like this!  But when Oberyn is defeated,  Tyrion is sentenced to death.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In Westeros the pursuit of justice is  as futile as anything else.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Is that any way to speak about our mother?  Tyrion is released from jail by his brother Jaime  and told to go and board a ship and run away.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Instead he decides to check in on his father.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But it's his former lover Shae  that he discovers in Tywin's bed.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Tyrion then kills Shae in a sort of fit of jealousy  and then takes a crossbow and goes to find his father.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Tyrion.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Put down the crossbow.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's so tightly wound, this scene.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This is someone who spent his whole life  trying to win his approbation, as much as he hated him,  he really wanted that, you know.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Obviously that's never gonna happen now  because he put a crossbow bolt in his groin.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What it means, is when a big character like that goes,  there's gonna be a power vacuum and there's gonna be  hustling and jostling to get into his place.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I am the queen!  I am the queen! Have you lost your mind?  Join us after the break, we're in season five  and new power rises in King's Landing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Welcome back to the Story So Far.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Where in season five, a Royal Wedding unsettles Cersei.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Her son Tommen is now king  and has fallen under the spell of his new Queen, Margaery,  much to Cersei's dismay.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When Margaery come in his life,  I think he was just enjoying life so much.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Judging from the King's enthusiasm,  the Queen Mother will be a queen grandmother soon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Wouldn't that be a lovely day.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Him being King  was just a whole new excitement, a whole new life.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Cersei empowers religious fanatics  to help her topple her rival, Queen Margaery.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You can't do this.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 I am The Queen!  She brings back the faith militant because she's, like, well  hopefully I can clear the board with these guys  and regain some of my power.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But Cersei's engineered her own downfall.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Royalty is no longer above the law  and fanatics come for her next.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  There's another contender to power  in Westeros and it's it's religion.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's the power of the faith.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They want to remove all the excesses,  to strip Cersei of all her finery,  and encourage her, in inverted commas,  to become clean.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  A sinner comes before you.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Watching Cersei do the walk of atonement  something happened that I thought would never happen  and that is I felt compassion.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  No matter what she'd done previously,  she didn't deserve this.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so season 5 sees her left naked  before her subjects to atone for her infidelities.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The walk of shame was tough was very, very tough for her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Very, very few women could have done what she did,  complete that walk.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And you see her  trying to maintain this regal presence  but she can't.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Stripped down to her literally,  physically and emotionally and psychologically  stripped down to her most vulnerable,  and then swept up into the arms of the Beast that she,  that she invited into the world.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The strange creation that is her new knight.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's just a brilliant twist.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Also getting a new ally in season five is Daenerys,  in the form of Tyrion.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  After killing his father, he's fled across the Narrow Sea,  a fugitive on the run.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He was a Lannister  and he had all the money in the world  and a noble name and a big bag of gold  can buy you a lot.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 All that's gone now.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's totally at the mercy of  the people he's traveling with.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Who're you? - And then the unthinkable happens.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - I am the gift.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - He's captured and handed over  to his family's greatest enemy,  the Targaryen Queen in Waiting, Daenerys.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  My name is Tyrion Lannister.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And between them they are an extraordinary force.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Protect your queen!  She appoints him as her political adviser  but when a civil rebellion begins,  Tyrion gets to witness Daenerys transform into a true Targaryen.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The symbol of the Targaryen's coming to claim their power  is on the back of a dragon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 'Cos I mean,  it's not much you can do  when you're standing on the ground and a dragon's coming at you.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's had the dragons now for quite a long time  but her actually becoming a dragon rider,  that's her claiming her birthright  more than I think anything else we've seen her do because  that is how the Targaryan's wielded their power.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Vlar!  Everybody painted that picture of Daenerys  flying her dragon, had never really happened,  and I've waited so many years to see that  and she finally does and she does it in a wicked way  where she's escaping death.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Daenerys, she's got the greatest name ever.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Stormborn, Mother of Dragons.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen, I love that name.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's got these dragons as backup  and then she's got Tyrion,  who knows King's Landing,  who knows the political side of things,  and he's been through battles as well.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Yet as season five ends,  Daenerys' dragon delivers her to an uncertain fate.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The last thing we see of Daenerys in season five,  she's surrounded by Dothraki, back where she bloody started.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In season five is one of vengeance for Arya.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The young Stark follows her mentor to Braavos  - to become an assassin.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - To serve well,  a girl must become no-one.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Arya's relationship with Jaqen is fascinating.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He is utterly mysterious  and she is seduced by his power.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I didn't come here to sweep floors.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  No?  Why come then?  - You said I could be your apprentice.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - The power of death,  the power to choose who dies.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And Arya uses her new skills to slaughter Meryn Trant,  a name on her kill list of people who've destroyed her world.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Arya, I think has crossed a line,  and if you look back to season one,  what would Ned Stark think of Arya's actions.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Is that what he would want for his daughter?  There is a sense of vengeance  rather than a sense of justice.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As Arya explores vengeance,  back home the battle is on for the Stark family home.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Stannis Baratheon is marching on Winterfell,  now held by the Bolton's.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's going after something and it is,  it's increasingly futile.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In a desperate move,  Stannis follows the advice of the red priestess  who promises him victory  if he makes an unspeakable offering to the Lord of Light.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She managed to convince him to burn his own daughter.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  That's one of the most chilling scenes, I think, of season five,  when, when he burns his child.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's believed in this god for so many years I think that  if it's not to do with the god she kind of just  blocks everything out  and I think that's what happened as she blocked out  the fact that she was going to be sacrificing a child.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She was sacrificing the King's blood.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Melisandre really thought that Stannis would be the one  and you know she's put a lot of her heart and soul  and everything else into, into helping him.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But it proves to be his undoing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  His men desert him,  and Melisandre, realizing all is lost,  - flees to Castle Black, - Your Grace.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  leaving Stannis to advance to Winterfell on his own.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Speak up.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Can't be worse than mutiny.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's had a rough old time, Stannis, hasn't he.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Because really he should be the king from  after Robert Baratheon dies,  but every battle he loses he becomes  further and further involved with this kind of fantasy.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And awaiting Stannis at Winterfell  are the Bolton's who tried to cement their position in the north  with a tactical marriage to Sansa Stark,  orchestrated by master manipulator Petyr Baelish.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She shouldn't trust Littlefinger,  I mean why are you gonna trust Littlefinger, I mean, geez!  He is the dodgy car salesman in Game of Thrones,  offers you everything and gives you nothing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  May I introduce my son,  Ramsay Bolton.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Now that the Bolton's have kind of  established themselves at Winterfell,  bringing in a Stark will really solidify their position in the north.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But it's a huge miscalculation  that traps her in another brutal relationship.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ramsay is a horrible, cruel, evil, power-hungry man.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He took psychotic nature to another level.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I mean he went there, and he went some.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Oh, no no no.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You stay here Reek.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You watch.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Fellow-prisoner Theon Greyjoy aka Reek is too terrified to help.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think we all thought he should have stepped in on the wedding night.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Let's be frank.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  With Ramsay distracted by battle,  - You're leaving it to me? - Sansa is caught attempting to escape,  and it's only then that Reek finds the courage  to become Theon again.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Stop! Stop!  I think that was a moment that we all needed to see,  Theon again had been so much at the mercy of Ramsey,  that finally he had a moment where he could do good.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so by the end of season five,  Sansa has jumped either to her death or to her freedom.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's someone  being pushed in every way to the absolute limit  of their will to live and  having come through that,  she's obviously gonna be quite a different person.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As Sansa and Theon leap from the walls of Winterfell,  nearby Stannis is facing defeat by the vast Bolton army.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think Stannis had given up.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think even before they'd gone into battle,  I think he was going there to die.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Fate finally catches up with Stannis  when he comes face-to-face with Brienne of Tarth  who sought vengeance for Renly's death since season two.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She is probably the toughest person going about,  about Westeros.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But as Stannis bows out,  Jon Snow comes up against a greater foe  when he ventures to Hardhome  to make peace with the Wildlings.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This alliance is sacrilege,  but when the White Walkers launch a full attack,  Jon sees his hunch is right.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  All humans must unite to fight them.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  What's so great about the whole White Walker mythology  is the way it has been building throughout the series.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Who knows what they want.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 They would bring  death and destruction to absolutely everything.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Up until this point they've been  semi-mythical characters.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 It's been  the White Walkers in those cold lands  that no one ever goes to  and here they are in front of the heroes,  then they're very real  and it's a very real danger.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I don't think the White Walkers are afraid of anything.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think fear is just not in their vocabulary.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And then Jon and the viewers see the Night's King  reveal that he has a greater power.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He can raise and recruit the dead.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It's a challenge to Jon,  and 'look what I can do'.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Forget all the other battles that are going on,  you know, battles for castles and, and kingship, you know,  he's got to focus his army.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But on Jon's return to Castle Black  in the final minutes of season 5,  viewers witness the cruelest blow of all  in a gut churning finale.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When I saw the cross with traitor written on it, I thought oh  no, they're not gonna kill him  and then they did!  For the Watch.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You root for him  but the great thing about Game of Thrones  is your heroes can die any second.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  For The Watch.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're all members of the Night's Watch and  no matter what one of their brothers has done,  what they did was worse than what he did.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so season 5 ends on betrayal and death.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Is this really the end for Jon Snow?  Only season six holds the answer, after the break.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Welcome back to the Story So Far,  where season six begins at the scene of a crime.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Jon snow lies slain at Castle Black  and all hopes are pinned on the red priestess  and her magic to bring him back.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Game of Thrones needs Jon Snow.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We do, we need him to finish what he started.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As viewers hope for Jon's resurrection,  we learn that Melisandre harbors a great secret.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The reveal of ancient Melisandre  was definitely one of the most stunning surprises  in season six of Game of Thrones.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It shows how much older she actually is  and how much longer she's been believing in this god for.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Then we see her use this power for Jon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She tries to bring him back to us, to resurrect him, it doesn't work.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When the wolf started to sort of make some noise that's when I thought,  I think everyone thought,  Jon Snow's alive.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And then he's just like that moment of  Jon Snow has returned and all the Westeros rejoices.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And after the miracle of Jon's rebirth,  comes a partial reunion of scattered Starks  when Sansa arrives at Castle Black,  and together they'll gather forces  in a bid to retake the north.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Sansa's become majestic but  she's also become savvy.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's lost that naivety.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  A monster has taken our home  and our brother.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's a queen, really.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In terms of being from a powerful family  and being able to make decisions  and tell other people to do stuff,  I think she's gonna tell other people to do stuff.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And across the sea in season six,  another young royal's in similar mood.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Daenerys,  who's been a hostage of the Dothraki,  burns their leaders and converts the tribe.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The huge Dothraki horde.
s07e00	The Story So Far	    We're gonna finally get a lot of  different power factions coming together  in a very scary explosive way.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And she also gets a navy,  forging an alliance with the Ironborn who bring ships.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But as Great Houses unite for war,  beyond the Wall we learn more about the deathly foe  which threatens them all.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  While time training with a three-eyed Raven,  Bran Stark uncovers a great secret.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  White Walkers were created from the first men.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The children of forest  invented the White Walkers to help  protect their own race.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It was an innocent defense  to do that.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But clearly it has gone out of control.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And when the White Walkers come for Bran,  there are terrible casualties.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Hodor is a goner.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Hold the door!  A completely pure act of protection.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  There was nothing,  there was no greater goal  to what he did  other than protect Bran.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Everyone who's basically just given  in order to give way for Bran and  there must be a reason, right?  We know he's become the three-eyed Raven.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But how's he going to use those powers.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And as the three-eyed Raven,  Bran resolves a great Stark secret  when he sees Jon Snow's mother  is Ned's sister, Lyanna.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You understand what Ned has been going through the whole time.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He made out that it was his son, his bastard son,  but it was really his nephew.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But it confirms Jon Snow is still half Stark  and in season six,  he and Sansa march on their family seat of Winterfell  to fight Ramsay Bolton,  in what goes down in history as the Battle of the Bastards.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ramsay's now top dog,  having murdered his father and newborn brother.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Now, if you want to save  You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  When you play the Game of Thrones,  you either win or you die, you know, and she knows  it's about winning now;  she's had enough of all the rest; it's time to win.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She offers her insight.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  You think he's going to fall into your trap, he won't.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's the one who lays traps.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's lived with this man for a long time and she knows that,  he is cruel to the core.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  - Sansa's words go unheeded.
s07e00	The Story So Far	 - Let's play a game.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ramsay baits Jon with his hostage Rickon.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Run to your brother.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It shows a lot about how Ramsay's mind works.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  He's calculating; he's always thinking about the next move,  you know it's very interesting how Machiavellian he can be as well.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ramsay Bolton's, like, yes  I've got you now boy,  just in the middle of no man's land.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  That's what Game of Thrones does so brilliantly is, it,  it's constantly pitting good moral forces against bad ones,  and you don't just win because you're good.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They were surrounded by the entire army;  they were being driven into the mud.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Ramsay should have won, he was much more conniving, much more cunning,  and if it hadn't have been for Sansa coming in at the last minute,  then he probably would have won.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Now that Sansa has brought the cavalry,  the Knights of the Vale,  it's a done deal that the Starks are going home.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This was probably the first  major victory in, in six years.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're suddenly inside the castle.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Winterfell.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It seems Jon will kill Ramsay,  but he then leaves Sansa to take the scalp.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  There was only one way to kill him  and Sansa found the right way to do it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She knows what she's gonna do, and  she knows he deserves it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  All memory of you will disappear.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  If you were face to face with your nemesis  and you had the opportunity,  you'd take it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's hardcore.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She has the makings of a Cersei.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But it's Jon Snow who becomes king as the season ends  with the Starks controlling the north  and for now Sansa is by his side.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's a character that will surprise people  because she's not what she seems.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And neither is Sansa's sister Arya.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Blinded and stabbed in her training as a faceless man  she's now back in Westeros to deal with Walder Frey.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's gone on this mad journey.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Arya comes in disguise,  having chopped up Walder's sons.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They weren't easy to carve.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She wanted him to see who she was.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The face comes off and there's a knife.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The last thing you're ever going to see  is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's been caught up in it so young  that she's turning into this child soldier.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Revenge is a dish best taken cold.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I literally cannot wait now  for her and Cersei to face off.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In fact Cersei elevates revenge to an art form in season six  as the Lannisters fight for their family's very survival.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  These royal lovers are united in grief  after the Sand Snakes killed their daughter.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Lannisters are all about power.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  They're all about revenge.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We're the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world,  and everything they've taken from us  we're going to take back and more.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It doesn't matter how long it takes,  they will get you back.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  With Jamie sent away to fight revolt,  Cersei is left alone to face judgment by the faith militant.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We are told that Cersei is going to turn up for a trial but  we know perfectly well she's not going to.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But it's now she plays a game-changing hand.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She was always going to have a dastardly plan.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The man who was sent by Cersei to hold Tommen in that room  There's something wrong.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Marjorie knows what's up in an instant.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The High Scept is packed with those who've wronged Cersei.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The Tyrells, High Sparrow and faith militant.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  The amazing thing about Game of Thrones  is the spectacle is always incredible  and you never know it's coming.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  This isn't gonna end well.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Cersei has, of course, unleashed wildfire.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's wiped out this fantastic building;  she's destroyed all her enemies.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  That's what makes Cersei so brilliant;  she's been to the absolute lowest place  that you could possibly go  and she still comes out on top.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  In the moment where she gets her revenge on everyone else, she loses  the only thing that she has left that matters to her.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Knowing that his mum's the one that's  pretty much murdered his wife,  what has he got to live for.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Tommen's death leaves the Iron Throne empty,  so a new reign begins.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  A witch told her that she,  she was cursed and that all of her children would die.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  It didn't stop her from loving her kids  and trying to protect them at any cost,  but she accepts very swiftly her fate.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  And so Jamie returns to a new world order,  courtesy of his sister.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  She's devastated the Tyrells.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Now the Lannisters are once more a force to be reckoned with.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Queen Cersei, sitting on the Iron Throne.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I think it's good to see her on the throne,  because it really has been her who's been pushing the men,  and so she should be there, right there or wrongly.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As one Queen takes the throne,  another sets sail to challenge her for it.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Finally Daenerys, the Targaryen Queen  is on her way to Westeros,  with a vast alliance she spent six seasons amassing.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  We're now getting to crunch time.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  As she comes to conquer,  the burning question for season seven:  who might join her now?  Absolutely everybody against the Lannisters, everyone against Cersei.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Like, Cersei doesn't have a chance.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  But they'll fuck with us.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  I do have this theory that the White Walkers  will sit on the Iron Throne.
s07e00	The Story So Far	  Just leave those dragons alone.
s07e02	Stormborn	1 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)   (THUNDER CRASHING)  TYRION: On a night like this, you came into the world.
s07e02	Stormborn	  VARYS: I remember that storm.
s07e02	Stormborn	  All the dogs in King's Landing  howled through the night.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I wish I could remember it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I always thought this would be a homecoming.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Doesn't feel like home.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Good.
s07e02	Stormborn	  DAENERYS: Not so many lions.
s07e02	Stormborn	  VARYS: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The lords of Westeros despise her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Even before your arrival, they plotted against her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Now - They cry out for their true queen?  They drink secret toasts to my health?  People used to tell my brother that sort of thing,  and he was stupid enough to believe them.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back,  he'd have invaded King's Landing already.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
s07e02	Stormborn	  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We can take the Seven Kingdoms  without turning it into a slaughterhouse.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If the great houses support your claim against Cersei,  the game is won.
s07e02	Stormborn	  With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side,  we have powerful allies in the south.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I never properly thanked you for that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  They joined our side, my queen,  because they believe in you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?  I did.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And then you served the man who overthrew him.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I had a choice, Your Grace  serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But you didn't serve him long.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You turned against him.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure.
s07e02	Stormborn	  There have been few rulers in history  as cruel as the Mad King.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Robert was neither mad nor cruel.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He simply had no interest in being king.
s07e02	Stormborn	  So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Your Grace,  when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin,  Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who  Before I came to power, you favored my brother.
s07e02	Stormborn	  All your spies, your little birds,  did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak?  Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?  Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,  I knew nothing about you, save your existence  and that you were said to be beautiful.
s07e02	Stormborn	  So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Which you turned to your advantage.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Who gave the order to kill me?  King Robert.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Who hired the assassins?  Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?  Your Grace, I did what had to be done to  To keep yourself alive.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What kind of a servant is that?  The kind the realm needs.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.
s07e02	Stormborn	  As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I wasn't born into a great house.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I came from nothing.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.
s07e02	Stormborn	  When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?  Not with any king or queen, but with the people.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The people whose hearts you aim to win.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If you demand blind allegiance,  I respect your wishes.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But if you let me live, I will serve you well.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne  because I choose you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Because I know the people have no better chance than you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Swear this to me, Varys.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If you ever think I'm failing the people,  you won't conspire behind my back.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You'll look me in the eye as you have done today,  and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I swear it, my queen.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And I swear this if you ever betray me,  I'll burn you alive.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Forgive me, my queen.
s07e02	Stormborn	  A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.
s07e02	Stormborn	                    She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?  No, it didn't.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We've just decided to pardon those  who once served the wrong king.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?  Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord  can serve his cause.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What does your lord expect from me?  "The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.
s07e02	Stormborn	"  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
s07e02	Stormborn	  MISSANDEI: Your Grace, forgive me,  but your translation is not quite accurate.
s07e02	Stormborn	  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian,  so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,  "The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.
s07e02	Stormborn	"  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?  No, but I like it better.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?  Prophecies are dangerous things.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I believe you have a role to play.
s07e02	Stormborn	  As does another  the King in the North, Jon Snow.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Jon Snow?  - Ned Stark's bastard? - You know him?  I travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?  Aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is.
s07e02	Stormborn	  As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,  he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall  to protect them from grave danger.
s07e02	Stormborn	  As King in the North,  he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses,  so together they may face their common enemy.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He sounds like quite a man.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Summon Jon Snow.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Let him stand before you  and tell you the things that have happened to him,  the things that he has seen with his own eyes.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I can't speak to prophecies  or visions in the flames,  but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And I am an excellent judge of character.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If he does rule the North,  he would make a valuable ally.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The Lannisters executed his father  and conspired to murder his brother.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Very well.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Send a raven north.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Tell Jon Snow that his queen  invites him to come to Dragonstone  and bend the knee.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (CHATTER)  Gather round.
s07e02	Stormborn	 Come here.
s07e02	Stormborn	  SANSA: You think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Read the last bit.
s07e02	Stormborn	  "All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.
s07e02	Stormborn	"  What does that mean?  It's something he said to me the first night we met.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You know him better than any of us.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What do you think?  Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.
s07e02	Stormborn	  "The Seven Kingdoms will bleed  as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Join us.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Together, we can end her tyranny.
s07e02	Stormborn	"  Sounds like a charmer.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde,  a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons  a bit less charming.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What?  Fire kills wights, you told me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What breathes fire?  You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?  - No, too dangerous.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - But?  But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall,  do we have enough men to fight them?  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne,  she'll destroy the realm as we know it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.
s07e02	Stormborn	  With their help, the Mad King's daughter  has ferried an army of savages to our shores  mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground,  rape and enslave your women,  and butcher your children without a second thought.
s07e02	Stormborn	  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - (PEOPLE MURMURING) - CERSEI: You all remember the Mad King.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.
s07e02	Stormborn	  His daughter is no different.
s07e02	Stormborn	  In Essos, her brutality is already legendary.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And when she grew bored of that,  she fed them to her dragons.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But I need your help, my lords.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We must stand together, all of us  if we hope to stop her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (ALL MURMURING)  She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The same as Aegon when he conquered  the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e02	Stormborn	  How do you propose to stop them?  We are currently at work on a solution, my lord.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (CHATTER)  Lord Tarly.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Ser Jaime.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I believe you know my son.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Ser Jaime.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Rickard, isn't it?  Dickon.
s07e02	Stormborn	  That's it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Thank you for coming.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance, now more than ever.
s07e02	Stormborn	  They might not have come if you hadn't.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If my queen summons me, I answer the call.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And I've heard what she does to those who defy her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You ride for Horn Hill today?  I have an army to mobilize.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Won't be long before the fighting starts.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And which side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It's a long ride back to the Reach, Ser Jaime.
s07e02	Stormborn	 How may I serve?  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei  and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.
s07e02	Stormborn	  All her enemies.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Including Olenna Tyrell.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm a Tarly.
s07e02	Stormborn	  That name means something.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We're not oathbreakers.
s07e02	Stormborn	 We're not schemers.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We don't stab our rivals in the back  or cut their throats at weddings.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You swore an oath to the crown as well, Lord Tarly.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I've known Olenna since I was a child.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She was a great woman once.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Now she's broken.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She wants revenge so badly,  she brought the Dothraki to our shores.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I know you don't like my sister,  but you have to make a choice.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Do you fight with us  or with foreign savages and eunuchs?  When the war is won,  the queen will need a new Warden of the South.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I can think of no better man  than Randyll Tarly.
s07e02	Stormborn	  EBROSE: The infection has spread too far.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
s07e02	Stormborn	  How long?  It'll be years before it kills you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Could be 10.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Could be 20.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But how long until?  Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (GRUNTS)  Um  Pardon, Archmaester.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She had the greyscale as a baby and was cured.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - EBROSE: No.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - Isn't there some way  EBROSE: Does this look like a baby to you?  - No.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - Have you studied  the varying rates of greyscale progression  in infants and fully grown men?  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	  EBROSE: Maester Cressen discovered  Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
s07e02	Stormborn	  This is quite advanced.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And beyond our skills, ser.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once  to live out your life with the stone men.
s07e02	Stormborn	  As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.
s07e02	Stormborn	  How you choose to spend that time is up to you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Come, Samwell.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Should we send word to your family, Ser?  Jorah.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Jorah Mormont.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Mormont?  There's no need.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I've been dead to them for years.
s07e02	Stormborn	  EBROSE: Come, Samwell!  QYBURN: Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?  No, I can't say I have.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the throne room.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
s07e02	Stormborn	  They were his trophies.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He couldn't keep them around.
s07e02	Stormborn	  They would have made him look small.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Balerion the Dread.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.
s07e02	Stormborn	  His flames forged the Iron Throne  and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Powerful  but not invincible.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons  was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And if they can be wounded,  they can be killed.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The finest artillators and blacksmiths in King's Landing  have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If you'll kindly pull that lever.
s07e02	Stormborn	  YARA: If you want the Iron Throne, take it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The city will fall within a day.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It's called war.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I know how you wage war.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We don't poison little girls here.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Myrcella was innocent.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She was a Lannister.
s07e02	Stormborn	  There are no innocent Lannisters.
s07e02	Stormborn	  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  DAENERYS: That's enough.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You will treat him with respect.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
s07e02	Stormborn	  That's very nice to hear.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Of course, I can't remember a queen  who was better loved than my granddaughter.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The common people loved her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The nobles loved her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Commoners, nobles,  they're all just children, really.
s07e02	Stormborn	  They won't obey you unless they fear you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm grateful to all of you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But you have chosen to follow me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I will not attack King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We will not attack King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?  We will lay siege to the capital,  surrounding the city on all sides.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Cersei will have the Iron Throne,  but no food for her army or the people.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros  by appealing to their loyalty,  their love for their country.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If we besiege the city with foreigners,  we prove her point.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Our army should be Westerosi.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?  You are.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army  back up to King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital  alongside the Tyrell army.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
s07e02	Stormborn	  So, your master plan is to use our armies.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?  The Unsullied will have another objective.
s07e02	Stormborn	  For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Grey Worm and the Unsullied  will sail for the Rock and take it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Do I have your support?  You have mine.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Thank you all.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?  (DOOR CLOSES)  I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And we will bring peace back to Westeros.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Peace?  Do you think that's what we had under your father?  Or his father? Or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?  He's a clever man, your Hand.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I've known a great many clever men.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I've outlived them all.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You know why?  I ignored them.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The lords of Westeros are sheep.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Are you a sheep?  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You're a dragon.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Be a dragon.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - GREY WORM: MajÃ­.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (DOOR OPENS)  You leave tomorrow.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Were you going to say goodbye?  I will see you when I return.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But you don't know when that will be.
s07e02	Stormborn	  No one knows.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I wish you good fortune.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Missandei.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Why?  You know why.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I don't.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Y-you are my weakness.
s07e02	Stormborn	  That's what I am?  Your weakness?  When Unsullied are young, the masters learn their fears.
s07e02	Stormborn	  One boy is scared of dogs,  one boy hates high places,  one is frightened of the ocean.
s07e02	Stormborn	  They make the boy sleep with dogs  or climb a cliff.
s07e02	Stormborn	  They throw him in the water.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If he learns to swim, good.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If he drowns, good.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Either way, strong Unsullied.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But I had no fears.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I was never the biggest, never the strongest  but I was bravest, always.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - I believe it.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - Until  I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Now I have fear.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I do, too.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (SNIFFLES)  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I want to see you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Please.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (PANTING)  Might be useful.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,  but an excellent researcher.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Archmaester, I wondered if I - And this one.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Maester Faull was quite the opposite  a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Um, I wanted to ask you  If you're going to write histories, Tarly,  you have to do the research.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If you want people to read your histories,  you need a bit of style.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm not writing "A Chronicle of the Wars  Following the Death of King Robert I"  so it can sit on a shelf unread.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What? You don't like the title?  What would you call it, then?  Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?  We're not poets, Tarly.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.
s07e02	Stormborn	  This is your moment.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Use it wisely.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.
s07e02	Stormborn	  There are two recorded cases  of advanced greyscale being cured.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases  by Archmaester Pylos.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos  and his study of rare diseases.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Oh, you are? - Yes.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And shall I tell you how he died?  From greyscale.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Oh.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - The procedure's far too dangerous,  which is why it's now forbidden.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (CART WHEELS SQUEAKING)  (DOOR OPENS)  Hello.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - What are you doing? - (DOOR CLOSES)  You're Jorah Mormont,  the only son of Jeor Mormont.
s07e02	Stormborn	  My name is Samwell Tarly,  Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,  training to serve as maester at Castle Black.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I knew your father.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I was with him when he died.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Drink this.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - What is it? - Rum.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Drink it all, please.
s07e02	Stormborn	 I'm afraid this is going to hurt.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (COUGHING)  (CLEARS THROAT)  If you could take off your shirt.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (GRUNTS)  If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,  and if they hear you screaming, then we're both finished.
s07e02	Stormborn	  JORAH: Have you ever done this before?  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But no one else will try it, so I'm the best you've got.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Have a seat.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm going to have to remove the entire upper layer of infected tissue,  then apply a medicinal ointment to the  - (GROANING) - Shh, shh!  Shh.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Again, I'm sorry,  but please try not to scream.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (GRUNTING)  (SHUSHING)  (WHIMPERING)  (GROANS)  (MUFFLED SHOUTING)  (CHATTER, LAUGHTER)  They say her dragons are bigger than Aegon's.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Horseshit.
s07e02	Stormborn	 Cersei's just trying to frighten us.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I hope it's true.
s07e02	Stormborn	  If she lays siege to King's Landing, prices will triple.
s07e02	Stormborn	  As long as we get back there before they start.
s07e02	Stormborn	  One more round.
s07e02	Stormborn	 It's a long ride.
s07e02	Stormborn	  HOT PIE: Arry!  Hello, Hot Pie.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Sit down.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Who's that for?  Mm.
s07e02	Stormborn	 This is good.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Mm, I didn't do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You've been making pies?  One or two.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I can't believe you're here.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Did you meet the big lady?  - Big lady? - The lady knight?  You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Did she ever find you?  She found me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What happened to you, Arry?  You got any ale?  (POURING)  - Where you heading? - King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Why? - Heard Cersei's queen now.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Heard she blew up the Great Sept.
s07e02	Stormborn	  That must have been something to see.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Boom.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - Mm.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I can't believe someone would do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Cersei would do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  No, the Boltons are dead.
s07e02	Stormborn	  What?  Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a wildling army  and won the Battle of the Bastards.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He's King of the North now.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You're lying.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother, right?  - Thanks for the pie.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - (COINS JINGLING)  Friends don't pay.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Can't believe I thought you were a boy.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You're pretty.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Thanks.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Try not to get killed.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Ah, I won't.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm like you, Arry.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (SNIFFS) I'm a survivor.
s07e02	Stormborn	  200 miles to King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	  One bottle of rum.
s07e02	Stormborn	 You think we'll make it?  (GRUNTS)  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Come in.
s07e02	Stormborn	  A raven, my king, from the Citadel.
s07e02	Stormborn	  JON: This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarly.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He was my brother at the Night's Watch,  a man I trust as much as anyone in this world.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone  sits on a mountain of dragonglass.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (ALL MURMURING)  I received this a few days ago  from Dragonstone.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (ALL MURMURING)  He is now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She has a powerful army at her back  and, if this message is to be believed,  three dragons.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (ALL MURMURING)  JON: Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone  to meet with Daenerys.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And I'm going to accept.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - (ALL SHOUTING) - MAN: Accept?!  We need this dragonglass, my lords!  We know that dragonglass can destroy  both white walkers and their army.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But more importantly, we need allies!  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We can't defeat them on our own.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We don't have the numbers.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow,  then sail for Dragonstone.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing  - and roasted him alive.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - I know that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The North is one of those seven kingdoms.
s07e02	Stormborn	  This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You know him.
s07e02	Stormborn	 He's a good man.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Your Grace, with respect, I must agree with Lady Sansa.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I remember the Mad King all too well.
s07e02	Stormborn	  A Targaryen cannot be trusted.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Nor can a Lannister.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - ALL: Yeah!  Aye.
s07e02	Stormborn	 We called your brother king.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Winter is here, Your Grace.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We need the King in the North in the North.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - MEN: Aye! - (POUNDING TABLES)  You all crowned me your king.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I never wanted it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I never asked for it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But I accepted it because the North is my home.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it,  no matter the odds.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But the odds are against us.
s07e02	Stormborn	  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.
s07e02	Stormborn	 None of you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We can never hope to defeat them alone.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We need allies, powerful allies.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I know it's a risk.
s07e02	Stormborn	  But I have to take it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Then send an emissary.
s07e02	Stormborn	 Don't go yourself.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Daenerys is a queen.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Only a king can convince her to help us.
s07e02	Stormborn	  It has to be me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You're abandoning your people!  You're abandoning your home.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm leaving both in good hands.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - Whose? - Yours.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You are my sister.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You're the only Stark in Winterfell.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Until I return, the North is yours.
s07e02	Stormborn	  LITTLEFINGER: I delivered his bones myself.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Presented them to Lady Catelyn  as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Seems like a lifetime ago.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I was sorry when he died.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.
s07e02	Stormborn	  So did I.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Your father and brothers are gone,  yet here you stand, King in the North.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Last best hope against the coming storm.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You don't belong down here.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Forgive me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  We haven't ever talked properly.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I wanted to remedy that.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I have nothing to say to you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Not even "thank you"?  If it weren't for me, you'd have been slaughtered on that battlefield.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You have many enemies, my king, but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I love Sansa,  as I loved her mother.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (GRUNTS)  (CHOKING)  Touch my sister, and I'll kill you myself.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (GASPS)  (CHATTER)  (HORSE NEIGHING)  - MAN: Ready? - MAN #2: Ready?  MAN #2: Ready!  Come on.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - MAN: Yah! - MAN #2: Come on!

(GROWLING)  Nymeria, it's me, Arya.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (GRUNTS)  I'm heading north, girl.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Back to Winterfell.
s07e02	Stormborn	 I'm finally going home.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Come with me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Come with me.
s07e02	Stormborn	  That's not you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (MEN SHOUTING)  NYM: You can't have them all.
s07e02	Stormborn	 It's not fair.
s07e02	Stormborn	  OBARA: I'm oldest.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Mama will want Cersei for herself.
s07e02	Stormborn	  She's not my mama.
s07e02	Stormborn	  You can have Cersei.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I want the Mountain.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The Mountain killed Father.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He'll crush you with one hand.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Father got careless.
s07e02	Stormborn	 That's what Mama says.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Will you shut up about Mama?  "Mama, Mama, Mama.
s07e02	Stormborn	"  Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And then I won't have to share.
s07e02	Stormborn	  BOTH: "Mama!"  How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear,  I'll treat you to a Dornish red.
s07e02	Stormborn	  The best in the world.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Have you ever been to Dorne?  A few times.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Never stayed long.
s07e02	Stormborn	  A boy in every port?  A boy, a girl.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Depends on the port.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Could we get some more?  I thought it wasn't for you.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I'm developing a taste for it.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - He's not your servant.
s07e02	Stormborn	 - It's fine.
s07e02	Stormborn	  So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Once I kill my uncle.
s07e02	Stormborn	  And what will you be, handsome?  Whatever my queen commands.
s07e02	Stormborn	  He'll be my advisor, my protector.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Oh, I see.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Your protector.
s07e02	Stormborn	  So, if someone gets too close to you  He might have to intervene.
s07e02	Stormborn	  To hold that person back.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Until they've made their intentions known.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Why are you standing all the way over there, then?  A foreign invasion is underway.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Leave him be.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Seems like you don't need a protector.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - (CRASHING) - (MEN SHOUTING)  Stay here.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - (ALL SHOUTING) - MAN: We're under attack!  Euron.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (MEN SHOUTING)  (GRUNTS)  (YELLING)  (SCREAMS)  (GRUNTS)  (ALL SHOUTING)  (ALL GRUNTING)  You mother's below deck.
s07e02	Stormborn	 Keep her safe.
s07e02	Stormborn	  - (EXPLOSIONS) - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)  (EXHALES)  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  (MEN SHOUTING, SCREAMING)  (SCREAMING)  (ALL SHOUTING)  (GRUNTS)  Aah!  (GRUNTS)  (ROARS)  Yah!  (GRUNTING)  Aah!  (GROANS)  (SHOUTING)  (SCREAMS)  Yah!  Yah!  - (CHOKING) - (LEATHER CREAKING)  (GRUNTING)  (SCREAMS)  Kill us.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Get it over with.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (BOTH GRUNTING)  - (SCREAMS) - (GRUNTS)  Give your uncle a kiss.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (GRUNTS)  - (EURON SCREAMING) - (GRUNTS)  EURON: Little Theon!  Ah, come on, you cockless coward.
s07e02	Stormborn	  I have her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  Come and get her.
s07e02	Stormborn	  (SCREAMING ECHOES)  (CHOKING)  - (SPLASHES) - (CACKLING)  (WHIMPERING)  (SNIFFLES)
s07e03	Queen's Justice	I wish you all the happiness in the world.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - JAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella? - (PANTING)  Myrcella?  (SCREAMS)  Kill us!  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Please try not to scream.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  (GRUNTING)  MEERA REED: This is Brandon Stark.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Son of Ned Stark.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Let's get them inside.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  TYRION LANNISTER: For decades, House Lannister  has been the true power in Westeros,  and the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock,  and take it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Summon Jon Snow.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  TYRION: He would make a valuable ally.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  MELISANDRE: Let him stand before you and tell you the things  that have happened to him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We can never hope to defeat the army of the dead alone.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We need allies.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're abandoning your people! You're abandoning your home.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Until I return, the North is yours.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( theme music playing )   The bastard of Winterfell.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I believe we last saw each other atop the Wall.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You were pissing off the edge if I remember right.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Picked up some scars along the road.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's been a long road, but we're both still here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm Tyrion Lannister.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - Davos Seaworth.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - Ah, the Onion Knight.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Unluckily for me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Welcome to Dragonstone.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Our queen knows it is a long journey.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Of course.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( men murmuring )  Please, this way.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Where are you from?  I can't place the accent.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I was born on the Island of Naath.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Ah.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 I hear it's beautiful down there.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Palm trees and butterflies.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Haven't been, myself.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  This place has changed.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Tyrion: And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - Jon: She is.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - Does she miss me terribly?  A sham marriage.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 And unconsummated.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - I didn't ask.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - Well, it was.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 Wasn't.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Anyway  she's much smarter than she lets on.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She's starting to let on.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Good.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Tyrion: At some point,  I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit became King in the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  As long as you tell me how a Lannister  became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  A long and bloody tale.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Of course they do.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If I was your Hand, I would have advised against it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  General rule of thumb--  Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  True  but I'm not a Stark.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( screeching )  ( panting )  I'd say you get used to them  but you never really do.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Come, their mother is waiting for you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You begged us to summon the King in the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Don't you want to see him again?  I've done my part.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I've brought ice and fire together.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Strange.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,  but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Oh, I doubt that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Give us common folk one taste of power,  we're like the lion who tasted man.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Nothing is ever so sweet again.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Neither of us is common folk anymore.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I did not part on good terms  with the King in the North or his advisor.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Why?  Because of mistakes I made.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Terrible mistakes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - So, where will you go? - Volantis.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Good.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If you don't mind my saying,  I don't think you should return to Westeros.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm not sure you'd be safe here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Oh, I will return, dear Spider.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - One last time.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - My lady--  I have to die in this strange country.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Just like you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Missandei: You stand in the presence  of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,  rightful heir to the Iron Throne,  rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men,  Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,  the Mother of Dragons,  the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,  the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  This is Jon Snow.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He's King in the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I hope the seas weren't too rough.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The winds were kind, Your Grace.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Apologies, I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know,  but Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - He's not a lord.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - Forgive me--  Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Forgive me, Ser Davos.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I never did receive a formal education,  but I could have sworn I read  the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark,  who bent the knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  In exchange for his life and the lives of the Northmen,  Torrhen Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Or do I have my facts wrong?  I wasn't there, Your Grace.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  No, of course not.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But still, an oath is an oath.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And perpetuity means--  what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?  Forever.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Forever.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - So I assume, my lord - ( sighs )  you're here to bend the knee.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I am not.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Oh.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Well, that is unfortunate.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You've traveled all this way  to break faith with House Targaryen?  Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He burned my uncle alive.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms--  My father was an evil man.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  On behalf of House Targaryen  I ask your forgiveness  for the crimes he committed against your family.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And I ask you not to judge a daughter  by the sins of her father.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Our two houses were allies for centuries,  and those were the best centuries  the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Centuries of peace and prosperity  with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne  and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Together, we will save this country  from those who would destroy it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're right.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're not guilty of your father's crimes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Then why are you here?  Because I need your help, and you need mine.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Did you see three dragons  flying overhead when you arrived?  I did.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And did you see the Dothraki,  all of whom have sworn to kill for me?  They're hard to miss.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - But still, I need your help? - Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - Almost.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - But you haven't stormed King's Landing.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Why not?  The only reason I can see  is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's the fastest way to win the war,  but you won't do it,  which means, at the very least,  you're better than Cersei.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else,  we're children playing at a game,  screaming that the rules aren't fair.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - You told me you liked this man.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - I do.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen,  he's refused to bow, and now he's calling me a child.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I believe he's calling all of us children.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 Figure of speech.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your Grace, everyone you know will die before winter's over  if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I am not your enemy.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The dead are the enemy.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The dead?  Is that another figure of speech?  The Army of the Dead is on the march.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Army of the Dead?  You don't know me well, my lord,  but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?  No, I don't think you're either of those things.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Army of the Dead is real.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The white walkers are real.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Night King is real.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 I've seen them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If they get past the Wall  and we're squabbling amongst ourselves  we're finished.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I was born at Dragonstone.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Not that I can remember it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins  to murder a baby girl in her crib.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Not that it matters now, of course.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I spent my life in foreign lands.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  So many men have tried to kill me,  I don't remember all their names.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I have been sold like a broodmare.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I've been chained and betrayed,  raped and defiled.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Do you know what kept me standing  through all those years in exile?  Faith.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Not in any gods,  not in myths and legends.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  In myself.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  In Daenerys Targaryen.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries  until my children were born.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea, any sea.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They did for me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,  and I will.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You'll be ruling over a graveyard  if we don't defeat the Night King.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The war against my sister has already begun.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You can't expect us to halt hostilities  and join you in fighting  whatever you saw beyond the Wall.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You don't believe him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I understand that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 It sounds like nonsense.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But if destiny has brought Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,  it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros?  He is the first to make allies of wildlings and Northmen.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He was named King in the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Not because of his birthright.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He has no birthright.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 He's a damn bastard.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader  because they believe in him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  All those things you don't believe in,  he faced those things.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He fought those things for the good of his people.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He risked his life for his people.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He took a knife in the heart for his people.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He gave his own--  If we don't put aside our enmities and band together,  we will die.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If it doesn't matter, then you might as well kneel.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,  help her to defeat my sister,  and together, our armies will protect the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  There's no time for that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  There's no time for any of this!  While we stand here, debating--  It takes no time to bend the knee.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Pledge your sword to her cause.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And why would I do that?  I mean no offense, Your Grace,  but I don't know you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  As far as I can tell,  your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name,  and my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The lords of the North  placed their trust in me to lead them,  and I will continue to do so as well as I can.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  That's fair.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's also fair to point out  that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom,  you are in open rebellion.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( footsteps approaching )  ( whispering ) Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I have grave news.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You must forgive my manners.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You'll both be tired after your long journey.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( speaking Dothraki )  Am I your prisoner?  Not yet.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Our ironborn and Dornish allies  were attacked en route to Dorne.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - And? - Two or three ships escaped,  the rest, sunk or captured.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, dead or captured.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Greyjoys, dead or captured.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  All of them?  ( men shouting )  - Pull! - Heave!  Pull!  ( men grunt )  ( grunts )  Your sister's dead?  Euron has her.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You saw him take her?  - But you got away? - I couldn't save her.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I tried.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You wouldn't be here if you tried.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Man: Come, men!  Sails up!  ( crowd cheering )  Woman: Murderer!  Man: Whores!  - ( all shouting ) - Traitor!  This is the life.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( cheering )  - ( grunts ) - ( laughter )  I have to be honest,  this is making me hard.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Did you see Little Theon's face  right before he jumped overboard?  "Oh, no!" ( laughs )  What a twat.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( crowd booing )  - ( crowd shouting ) - ( spits )  - Man: Whore! Whore! Whore! - Man #2: Murderers!  ( applause )  ( grunts )  My queen, please accept this gift  on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( both grunt, gasp )  I give you what no other man could give--  justice.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Justice for your murdered daughter.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas  and a true friend to the crown.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You deserve more than a true friend.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  There's only one reward I want.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You shall have what your heart desires  when the war is won.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces  and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,  the sons and daughters of Westeros  shall defend our country.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( crowd cheering )  There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Though I suppose you wouldn't know.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And if you turn on us,  they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Or yours.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They just like severed heads, really.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Listen, if you have any advice at all,  I would love to hear it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  When we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Advice?  Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?  Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 We'll talk later.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Cersei: I want you to know I understand.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Even though we're enemies, you and I,  I understand the fury that drives you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I was there that day  when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If I close my eyes,  I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The sound of your scream.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I never heard a sound like that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I thought, "That's true love.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	"  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 He really did.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  No one moved like him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  No one had such skill with a spear.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If only he hadn't taunted him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's buried somewhere.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  That must be difficult for you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  When my daughter was taken from me,  my only daughter  well, you can't imagine how that feels  unless you've lost a child.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me  to give her to the wet nurse.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I never got to have a mother,  but Myrcella did.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She was mine, and you took her from me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Why did you do that?  Doesn't matter now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your daughter's a beauty, too.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Those brown eyes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Those lips.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Perfect Dornish beauty.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I imagine she's your favorite.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites,  but still, we're only human.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We love whom we love.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( muffled speech )  I'm sorry, I can't understand you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It must be frustrating.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We all make our choices.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You chose to murder my daughter.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - ( grunts ) - Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Not at all, really.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy  and imagine ways of killing my enemies.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I thought about having Ser Gregor  crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It would be poetic, I suppose, but fast, too fast.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She's so beautiful.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The thought of this lovely face  cracking open like a duck egg,  no, it's just not right.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - ( Tyene whimpers ) - ( gasps )  Mama.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( grunts )  ( crying )  Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Long Goodbye, was that it?  - The Long Farewell.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - That's the one.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How long does the poison take?  Qyburn: Difficult to say-- hours, days.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It depends on the subject's constitution.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - But death is certain? - Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your daughter will die here in this cell,  and you will be here watching when she does.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You'll be here the rest of your days.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If you refuse to eat, we'll force food down your throat.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You will live to watch your daughter rot.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - To watch that beautiful face collapse - ( sobbing )  to bone and dust.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  All the while contemplating the choices you've made.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I don't want her to miss a thing.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( both crying )  No.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( panting )  ( birds chirping )  ( knocking on door )  Don't.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  What are you doing? No one can see us like this.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 I'll do as I please.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Forgive me, Your Grace.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The visitor from Braavos has arrived.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Good.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  At once, Your Grace.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( chuckles )  ( liquid pouring )  No, thank you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  My condolences, Your Grace,  on the death of your son.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  From all reports, he was a fine young man.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Iron Bank didn't send you here to offer condolences.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Condolences and congratulations.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  To become the first ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,  that's quite an accomplishment.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition,  freeing the crown from elements  who sought to subvert the rule of law.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Indeed, but sometimes tragedies are necessary  to restore order and rational leadership.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your father never minced words either.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But, yes, your debts are considerable.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And you're now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We both know how expensive war can be.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And we both know gold wins wars.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your vaults are empty.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your wealthiest allies, the Tyrells, are now your enemies.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We don't make bets.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  A fancy way of saying "bet.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	"  The war's already begun.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 I've drawn first blood.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I decapitated the Dornish snake.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  For now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Daenerys Targaryen has three full-grown dragons.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How well do wooden ships fare against fire-breathing dragons?  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How are your profits  now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?  The slave trade has entered a downturn, it's true.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  From what I gather, she considers herself  more of a revolutionary than a monarch.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  In your experience, how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries?  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money,  but Lannisters always pay their debts.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?  Your father's daughter, indeed.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Give me a fortnight.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And when you return to Braavos,  I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I came down here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're making it difficult.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You look a lot better brooding than I do.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm a prisoner on this island.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're free to walk the castle,  the beaches, to go wherever you want.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Except to my ship.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You took my ship.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I wouldn't say we took your ship.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm not playing word games with you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The dead are coming for us all.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Why don't you figure out what to do  about my missing fleet and murdered allies,  and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's hard for me to fathom.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 It really is.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King  You probably don't believe me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I do, actually.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You didn't before.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  "Grumkins and snarks," you called them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It was nonsense.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 Everybody knew it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But then Mormont saw them  and you saw them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And I trust the eyes of an honest man  more than I trust what everybody knows.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How do I convince people who don't know me  that an enemy they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?  - Good question.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - I know it's a good question.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm looking for an answer.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  People's minds aren't made for problems that large.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  White walkers, the Night King,  Army of the Dead--  it's almost a relief to confront  a comfortable, familiar monster like my sister.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I can't help them from here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'd like to leave.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North  by giving up that easily.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Don't go south.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter,  a foreign invader.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And here I am,  a Northern fool.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Children are not their fathers,  luckily for all of us.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders  and Northern fools than meets the eye.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Instead, she stayed where she was  and saved many people from horrible fates,  some of whom are on this island with us right now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  While you're our guest here,  you might consider asking them  what they think of the Mad King's daughter.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She protects people from monsters,  just as you do.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's why she came here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And she's not about to head north  to fight an enemy she's never seen  on the word of a man she doesn't know.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  After a single meeting,  it's not a reasonable thing to ask.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  So, do you have anything reasonable to ask?  What do you mean?  Maybe you are a Northern fool.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - Dragonglass? - Tyrion: Yes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Volcanic glass, obsidian.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And what does the King in the North want with dragonglass?  Apparently, it can be turned into weapons  that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Or stop them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Destroy them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Unsure about the nomenclature.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And what do you think about this Army of the Dead  and white walkers and Night Kings?  I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing  simply because you want to believe it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Which wise man said this?  I don't remember.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?  I would never do that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  To you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I would have told him not to come.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And he's here anyway.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You don't have to believe him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Let him mine the dragonglass.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If he's wrong, it's worthless.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You didn't even know it was here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's nothing to you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Give him something by giving him nothing.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Take a step toward a more productive relationship  with a possible ally.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand--  Casterly Rock.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  What was that Ser Davos said  about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?  You must allow them their flights of fancy.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's dreary in the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( screeching )  Amazing thing to see.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I named them for my brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They're both gone now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You lost two brothers as well.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  People thought dragons were gone forever, but here they are.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You've been talking to Tyrion.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He is my Hand.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - He enjoys talking.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - We all enjoy what we're good at.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I don't.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I never expected that you would.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And I haven't changed my mind  about which kingdoms belong to that throne.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I haven't either.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( sighs )  I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Thank you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  So you believe me, then, about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?  You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( chatter )  How much do we have?  4,000 bushels, my lady.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  What does that mean?  For the current occupants of the castle,  it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And what's the longest winter in the past hundred years?  Uh, I'm not entirely certain.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I-I'll check Maester Luwin's records.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're telling me we don't have enough food,  especially not if the armies of the North come back to defend Winterfell?  No, my lady, most likely not.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Then we must prepare for that eventuality.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Whatever direction the threat comes from,  this is the best place to be.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We need to start building up our grain stores  with regular shipments from every keep in the North.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If we don't use it by winter's end, we'll give it back to them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But if the entire North has to flee to Winterfell,  they won't have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Very wise, my lady.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?  Are they covering those breastplates in leather?  No, my lady.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Well, shouldn't they be? Once the real cold comes?  They should, indeed.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Pardon me, my lady.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You there, why isn't there leather on these?  Command suits you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Northerners are all facing north,  worried about the threat from beyond the Wall.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  So they should be.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I know Cersei better than anyone here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If you turn your back on her--  You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I only meant to say--  That the woman who murdered my mother, father, and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise counsel.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  One of two things will happen--  either the dead will defeat the living,  in which case  all our troubles come to an end,  or life will win out.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And what then?  Don't fight in the North or the South.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Everyone is your enemy,  everyone is your friend  every possible series of events is happening all at once.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Everything that happens will be something  that you've seen before.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Lady Sansa, at the gate.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( people murmuring )  Hello, Sansa.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( sobbing )  I wish Jon were here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Yes, I need to speak to him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're Father's last living trueborn son.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're Lord of Winterfell now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I can never be Lord of Winterfell.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I can never be lord of anything.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I don't know what that means.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's difficult to explain.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Try.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 Please, for me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It means I can see everything.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Everything that's happening right now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's all pieces now, fragments.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I need to learn to see better.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  When the Long Night comes again,  I need to be ready.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How do you know all this?  The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I told you it's difficult to explain.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( sighs )  Bran--  I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'm sorry it had to happen here in our home.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It was so beautiful that night.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Snow falling, just like now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And you were so beautiful  in your white wedding dress.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I have to go back inside, Bran.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'll stay a bit longer.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( man coughing in distance )  Hmm.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Hmm.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Does it hurt?  A bit.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 Less than before.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The infection no longer appears to be active.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( sighs )  Unusual.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Unlikely.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  One could almost be forgiven  for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided  and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Don't know anything about that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I just started feeling better.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I assumed it was the rest that did it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And the climate.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The climate.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You're free to go, ser.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  This chamber is needed for the infectious,  which you are no longer.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How bad is it?  Suppose I'll find out this evening.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - Where will you go? - ( grunts )  I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I knew it would kill me  or I'd kill myself before it could.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The only place for me is back with her.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I owe her my life.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Her and you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( chuckles )  Your father saved me more than once.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's the least I could do.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Perhaps our paths will cross again.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I hope they do.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - Ebrose: You treated him? - Yes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Who told you to treat him?  No one.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?  I seem to remember you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - But you treated him anyway? - I did, yes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful,  especially on someone of that age.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You could have infected yourself and others.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But you didn't.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links  have attempted it and failed.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Yet you succeeded.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How?  I read the books and followed the instructions.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  That man is alive because of you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You should be proud.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Thank you, Archmaester.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Come here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  All these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I need you to make copies of them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You were expecting a reward.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You'd better get started.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And careful of the paper mites.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They like flesh as well.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  To send our remaining ships after him--  I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Would you have to go yourself?  Euron's ships could be anywhere  or in more than one place.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You'd be flying around the open seas alone  for who knows how long.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I wouldn't be alone.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I would have Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  What can anyone do to them?  Missandei: They can still do something to you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It only takes one arrow.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It's too great a risk.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 You're too important.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  What about Casterly Rock?  The Unsullied will be there soon.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And what will they face?  A difficult situation.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They know we're coming.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Yes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 Cersei believes my sole purpose in life  is to destroy House Lannister.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She will be ready.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - No one has ever taken the Rock.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - Man: Archers!  Tyrion: The Lannister Army is still the army my father built.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - Come on! - Tyrion: Well-trained and well-provisioned.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  10,000 men at least.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They will see us coming.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They will be ready.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( men shouting )  - Man: Draw! Loose! - Man #2: Loose!  Tyrion: The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( men grunting )  The fight up the walls will be hard.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  We will be at a disadvantage.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  - ( grunts ) - Many men will die.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Just as my father said they would.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Interesting thing about my father--  he built our house up from near ruin.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He built our army, he built Casterly Rock as we know it,  but he didn't build the sewers.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  That was beneath him,  so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find--  me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He was right, I was low.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The company I kept, low.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Women, mostly.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They weren't welcome at the Rock.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Couldn't walk them through the front gates,  I couldn't have them in my chambers,  so in the process of building the sewers,  I threw in something for myself.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It was a passage that began  in an out of the way cove by the sea  and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  No better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  ( grunts, wheezes )  But as a good friend of mine once said,  "Give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	"  - ( grunting ) - ( all shouting )  And so it begins.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They will be outnumbered.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They will be fighting for freedom  and the person who gave it to them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They will be fighting for you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And that is why they will triumph.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	        ( distant explosions )  Where are they?!  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?  ( men shouting )  ( chatter )  ( door opens )  - It's done.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 - It is.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And now the rains weep o'er our halls.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Did we fight well?  Uh, as well as could be expected.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It was never our forte.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Golden roses, indeed.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Your brother and his new queen  thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Well, it is to me,  but my fond childhood memories  won't keep Cersei on the throne.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  So you just let them take it?  For now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 They won't be able to hold it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,  we emptied the larders before we left.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Eventually, they'll be forced to abandon their position  and march all the way across Westeros.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And you took your army, your real army,  and went where they weren't.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  There are always lessons in failures.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Yes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 You must be very wise by now.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  My father always said I was a slow learner.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If he was so clever,  why didn't he take Highgarden  the moment your gold mines ran dry?  ( scoffs )  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?  That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  What did he call it?  Widow's Wail.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Or watched them being done on my orders.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I never lost a night's sleep over them.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  They were necessary.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  And whatever I imagined necessary  for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But your sister has done things  I was incapable of imagining.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  That was my prize mistake--  a failure of imagination.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She's a monster, you do know that?  To you, I'm sure.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  To others as well.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us,  when people are living peacefully in the world she built,  do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?  You love her.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You really do love her.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You poor fool.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She'll be the end of you.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Possibly.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Not much to be gained  from discussing it with you, though, is there?  What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have  that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  If she's driven you this far,  it's gone beyond your control.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Yes.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It has.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  She's a disease.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I regret my role in spreading it.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You will, too.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I think we're done here.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  How will it happen?  Cersei had several ideas.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Whipping you through the streets  and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I talked her out of those.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Will there be pain?  No.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	 I made sure of that.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  That's good.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I'd hate to die like your son.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Clawing at my neck,  foam and bile spilling from my mouth,  eyes bloodred, skin purple.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Must have been horrible for you,  as a Kingsguard, as a father.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  It was horrible enough for me.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  A shocking scene.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Not at all what I intended.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  You see, I had never seen the poison work before.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  Tell Cersei.
s07e03	Queen's Justice	  I want her to know it was me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	(GRUNTING)  I lost this dagger.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  To whom?  Tyrion Lannister.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Take a step toward a more productive relationship  with a possible ally.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I will allow you to mine the dragonglass  and forge weapons from it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Thank you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  RANDYLL TARLY: She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  How do you propose to stop them?  We are currently at work on a solution.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  (THUDDING)  (HORSE BRAYING)  HOT PIE: I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Jon Snow came down from Castle Black  with a wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  He's King in the North now.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  (GRUNTING)  COMMANDER: Your sister's dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  THEON: Euron has her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I couldn't save her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 I tried.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You wouldn't be here if you'd tried.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  What about Casterly Rock?  (ROARING)  (GRUNTING)  TYCHO NESTORIS: We both know how expensive war can be.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Your vaults are empty.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My debt will be paid in full.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  How will it happen?  Will there be pain?  JAIME: No, I'll make sure of that.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'd hate to die like your son.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Not at all what I intended.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Tell Cersei.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I want her to know it was me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( theme music playing )   ( horse neighs )  Man: Hold that wagon!  ( horses neighing )  You've just won the biggest prize in the world.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on, you can tell me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls  before saying goodbye?  I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  There is no more High Septon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  No, there isn't, is there?  There is still the question of my prize.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  That's a lot of money I just gave you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  It's not a castle.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  How about that one? It's available.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You don't want Highgarden.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - I beg to differ.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - We're at war.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back the day after you move in.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Besides, think of the upkeep.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The more you owe, the more it weighs you down.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?  - Man: Move out! - Jaime: They're not mine.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  This all belongs to the Iron Bank.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  See? We pay our debts.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Right, just not to me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of  whatever nameless shit heap you're from  with a saddlebag full of gold,  complaining about not getting paid.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  When we win this war,  all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms  will be yours to choose from,  with no one left to take them away from you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign  will be quiet and peaceable.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Ah, stranger things have happened.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Like what?  The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - The current harvest? - We have teams of men collecting it  from all the farms in the Reach.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys  and help them accelerate this process?  I'm not much for shoveling wheat.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest--  I bet you're going to have a real talent for that.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Tycho: I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank  has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man,  but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You're too kind, my lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I am neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Its well-being is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - Uh, the gold - Is on its way.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance  in some current venture.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My only venture at this moment  is reestablishing control over this continent  and every person on it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I see a great deal of potential in that venture.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I imagine it would require outside investment.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  It will, indeed.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I need to expand my armies, my navies.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I know them well.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They have helped us recover significant sums  from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  That's good to hear.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Rest assured, Your Grace,  you can count on the Iron Bank's support.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - Hmm.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - As soon as the gold arrives.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( fire crackling )  Littlefinger: This is for you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat,  but your mother fought him off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The other dagger,  the one that took her life,  I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart  if I could have.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  But I am here for her now  to do what she would have done,  to protect her children.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Anything I can do for you, Brandon,  you need only ask.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Do you know who this belonged to?  No.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Forced from your home,  driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  To go through all of that and make your way home again  only to find such chaos in the world,  I can only imagine--  Chaos is a ladder.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( door opens )  ( exhales )  I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'm not Lord Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  What's that?  Maester Wolkan built it for me  so I can move around more easily.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  It's a very good idea.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You're leaving.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I don't want to leave you,  but when-- when they come,  I need to be with my family.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  And you're safe.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Well, as safe as anyone can be now.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You don't need me anymore.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  No, I don't.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  That's all you've got to say?  Thank you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Thank you?  For helping me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My brother died for you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Hodor and Summer died for you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I almost died for you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - Bran - I'm not, really.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Not anymore.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( crying )  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark,  but I remember so much else now.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You died in that cave.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I did.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The kitchen girl, the redhead with the behind.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  'Ey up.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 Where you going?  In there.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 I live here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( snickers ) Fuck off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'm Arya Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 This is my home.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( Henk snorts )  Arya Stark's dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrick.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - They'll tell you who I am.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - There's no Rodrick here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Maester's named Wolkan.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Go ask Jon Snow, then, the King in the North.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - He's my brother.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - He's a thousand miles away.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Look, it's cold and we're busy,  - so, you know, best fuck off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - Mm.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?  The Lady of Winterfell.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 Lady Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - Which Lady Stark? - Henk: You tell us.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You're the one impersonating her sister.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Tell Sansa her sister's home.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  So, for the last time, fuck off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( grunts )  I'm getting into this castle one way or another.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  But if I am and Sansa finds out you turned me away  Right, you sit there.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Right there.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Don't move.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Right, go tell Lady Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 I'll watch her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Henk: I ain't telling Lady Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 You can tell her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Koner: Why me?  - Henk: You're gonna tell her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - I'm not.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face  as hard as I can.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Koner: We told her to wait.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( sighs ) We were standing right next to her, and  And-- and when we turned around, she'd gone, my lady.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  She-- she was nothing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 Some winter town girl.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  She comes in asking for, uh, Ser Rodrick  - Rodrick, yeah.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 Luwin, yeah.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - and Maester Luwin.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( Henk stammering ) And don't trouble yourself over it, my lady.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - We'll-- we'll find her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - You don't have to.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I know where she is.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( fire crackling )  ( chain rattling )  Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?  Yes.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You shouldn't have run from the guards.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I didn't run.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You need better guards.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( chuckles )  It suits you Lady Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Jon left you in charge?  He did.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I hope he comes back soon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I remember how happy he was to see me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( chuckles )  It doesn't look like him.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Should've been carved by someone who knew his face.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Everyone who knew his face is dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We're not.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They say you killed Joffrey.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Did you?  I wish I had.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Hmm.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 Me, too.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  However long my list got, he was always first.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Your list?  Of people I'm going to kill.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  How did you get back to Winterfell?  It's a long story.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I imagine yours is, too.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Yes.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Not a very pleasant one.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Mine neither.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  But our stories aren't over yet.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  No, they're not.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Arya  Bran's home, too.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( crows cawing )  You came home.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I saw you at the crossroads.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You saw me?  I see quite a lot now.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Bran has visions.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I thought you might go to King's Landing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  So did I.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Why would you go back there?  Cersei's on her list of names.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Who else is on your list?  Most of them are dead already.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Where did you get this?  Littlefinger gave it to me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Littlefinger? He's here?  He has declared for House Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Why would he give you a dagger?  - He thought I'd want it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - Sansa: Why?  Because it was meant to kill me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The cutthroat after your fall?  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?  Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  He's not a generous man.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  He wouldn't give you anything  unless he thought he was getting something back.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - It doesn't matter.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - What do you mean it doesn't matter?  I don't want it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Are you sure?  Arya: It's Valyrian steel.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  It's wasted on a cripple.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( people chattering )  ( bleating )  Catelyn Stark would be proud.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You kept your vow.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I did next to nothing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You're too hard on yourself, my lady.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'm not a  Thank you, Podrick.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( raven cawing )  ( waves crashing )  Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Soon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  He will come back to you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  He'd better.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  What happened?  Many things.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Many things?  - ( sighs ) - Jon: Your Grace.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	    ( seagulls screeching )  I wanted you to see it  before we start hacking it to bits.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Well, this is it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 All we'll ever need.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The children of the forest made these.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  When?  A very long time ago.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They were right here,  standing where we're standing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Maybe even before there were men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  No.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They were here together, the children and the First Men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Doing what? Fighting each other?  They fought together against their common enemy.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Together.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We need to do the same if we're going to survive.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Because the enemy is real.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  It's always been real.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  And you say you can't defeat them  without my armies and my dragons?  No, I don't think I can.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I will fight for you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I will fight for the North.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  When you bend the knee.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My people  won't accept a southern ruler.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Not after everything they've suffered.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They will if their king does.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They chose you to lead them.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They chose you to protect them.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?  What is it?  We took Casterly Rock.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  That's very good to hear.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Isn't it?  You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - Perhaps-- - You will stay.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  All my allies are gone.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - You still have the largest armies.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - Who won't be able to eat  because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Tyrion: Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - We have a plan.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 It's still the right plan.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - The right plan!  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - If I have underestimated our enemies-- - Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( dragons screeching )  Enough with the clever plans.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I have three large dragons.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We've discussed this.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My enemies are in the Red Keep.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?  A smart one.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  What do you think I should do?  - I would never presume to-- - I'm at war.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'm losing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  What do you think I should do?  Jon: I never thought that dragons would exist again.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  No one did.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The people who follow you  know that you made something impossible happen.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Maybe that helps them believe  that you can make other impossible things happen.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Build a world that's different  from the shit one they've always known.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities,  you're not different.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You're just more of the same.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( dragons screeching )  ( both grunting )  - ( huffs ) - Don't lunge.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( grunting )  Don't go where your enemy leads you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Brienne: Up.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - And don't-- - Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Nice sword.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Very nice dagger.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores,  then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We can't  It's been a while since I trained.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  He didn't beat the Hound.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You did.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I want to train with you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You swore to serve both my mother's daughters,  didn't you?  Brienne: Move aside, Podrick.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You can't use that, my lady.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 It's too small.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I won't cut you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 Don't worry.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'll try not to.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( grunting )  ( grunts, shouts )  - ( shouting ) - ( grunts )  ( grunts )  ( exhales )  Who taught you how to do that?  No one.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( waves crashing )  ( seagulls screeching )  - Davos: What do you think of her? - Who?  ( sighs ) I believe you know of whom I speak.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I think she has a good heart.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  A good heart?  I've noticed you staring at her good heart.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  There's no time for that.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I saw the Night King, Davos.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 I looked into his eyes.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  How many men do we have in the North to fight him?  10,000? Less?  - Fewer.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - What?  Speaking of good hearts-- Missandei of Naath.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Ser Davos, Lord Snow.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  King Snow, isn't it?  No, that doesn't sound right.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - King Jon? - It doesn't matter.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Forgive me, but may I ask a question?  Of course.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?  I'm a bastard.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  My mother and father weren't married.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Is the custom different in Naath?  We don't have marriage in Naath,  so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  That sounds liberating.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Why did you leave your homeland?  I was stolen away by slavers.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I'm sorry.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  If I may, how did a slave girl  come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?  She bought me from my master and set me free.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Davos: That was good of her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Of course, you're serving her now, aren't you?  I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Because I believe in her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?  Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  You believe that?  I know it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  All of us who came with her from Essos,  we believe in her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  She's not our queen because she's the daughter  of some king we never knew.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  She's the queen we chose.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Will you forgive me if I switch sides?  ( bell ringing )  Jon: Is that a Greyjoy ship?  ( men shouting )  ( man shouts )  Man: Halt!  Jon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I didn't know you were here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  S-Sansa  is she all right?  What you did for her  is the only reason I'm not killing you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We thought you were dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I should be.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Davos: Your sister?  Euron has her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I came to ask the queen to help me get her back.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The queen is gone.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Where did she go?  - Man: Get the horses watered! - ( neighs )  ( chatter )  All the gold's safely through the gates of King's Landing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Good.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We need to get the last of these wagons  over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  The head of the line is ambushed,  the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Well, we are stretched a bit thin.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  With your permission,  flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Let's give them fair warning first.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  These men fought well at Highgarden.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - ( men grunting ) - Man: Now, get it on this thing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - Man #2: Lift! - ( men laughing )  - Ser Jaime.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - Rickon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Dickon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Your first battle?  And?  It was glorious.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Come on, your father's not here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  All my life, we've been pledged to House Tyrell.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I knew some of those men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 I hunted with them.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  They didn't deserve to die.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  But Lady Olenna chose to betray her queen  and support the Targaryen girl.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  So here we are.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I didn't expect it to smell like that.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Men shit themselves when they die.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?  Well, I learned it when I was five.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( distant horse neighs )  What?  Listen.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( distant hoofbeats approaching )  ( rumbling )  Jaime: Spears and shields! Spears and shields!  - What is it? - Bronn: Get in line!  Spears and shields! Spears and shields!  Get in line now!  Form up! Come on, lads!  Guard those wagons!  Form a line! Form a line!  Man: Round those spears!  ( men shrieking in distance )  Man: Shield wall!  Fill the gaps!  - Randyll: Archers, steady! - Man #2: Hold together!  - Archers! - Look alive!  Get tight!  Man: Get in line, boys!  - Ready! - Here they come!  - ( distant men shrieking ) - ( hoofbeats approaching )  - ( hoofbeats pounding ) - ( men shrieking, whooping )  ( all shrieking )  Man: Courage, lads! Courage!  Man #2: Wait! Wait for it!  Spears out!  ( men grunt )  - Jaime: Spears out! - Randyll: Steady! Hold the line!  - Get back to King's Landing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 - I'm not abandoning my army.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Bronn: You're the commander, not a damn infantryman.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Those fuckers are about to swamp us.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  We can hold them off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( dragon roaring )  ( roaring )  Dracarys!  ( pants )  ( men screaming )  ( screaming continues )  ( screams echoing )  ( Dothraki shrieking )  Jaime: Hold the line!  Hold!  - Bronn: Hold it, lads! - Hold the line!  - Man: Throw it! - ( grunts, screams )  - ( grunts ) - Man: Hold!  ( men grunting )  ( men shouting )  Man: Draw!  Loose!  ( dragon roars )  ( men screaming )  - Archers! - Man: Archers!  Archers, with me!  - Man: Archers, to the line! - Man #2: To the line!  - Nock! - Man: Nock!  - ( dragon roaring ) - Draw!  - Loose! - Man: Loose!  Man: Run!  ( men screaming )  Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Go get it, then.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  I can't shoot with one hand.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - ( horse neighs ) - Bronn: Come on!  ( shouts )  ( grunting )  ( shouts )  ( horse screaming )  ( shouts )  ( man screaming )  ( horse bellowing )  - ( men screaming ) - Man: Need help!  ( screaming )  ( men screaming )  ( dragon roaring )  ( Dothraki shrieking )  ( grunts )  Where are you?  ( roaring )  ( men screaming )  ( Dothraki shrieking in distance )  ( screams echoing )    ( horse screaming )  ( screams echoing )  ( dragon roaring )  Take cover!  Come on, you fucker.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  Dracarys.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( roaring )  ( yelps )  ( dragon crying out )  ( panting )  ( men screaming )  ( roaring )  ( grunting )  ( grunting )  ( roaring )  Flee, you idiot.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  - Come on, boy.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 Come on! - ( horse neighs )  You idiot.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	 You fucking idiot.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	  ( grunts )
s07e05	Eastwatch	Clegane, look into the flames.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What do you see?  The Hound: A wall of ice.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The only thing standing between us  and the army of the dead is the Wall,  and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Last time we saw The Night King,  it was at Hardhome.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch by the sea.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Tormund Giantsbane: And that's where I'll go.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Looks like we're the Nightswatch now.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Arya Stark: This suits you, Lady Stark.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Jon left you in charge? - He did.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  (grunting)  - Jaime Lannister: Lord Tarly.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - I believe you know my son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Do you fight with us  or with the fallen savages and eunuchs?  Daenerys Targaryen: What do you think I should do?  If you use them to melt castles and burn cities,  you're not different.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You're just more of the same.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Man: Listen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  (low rumbling)  (dragon growls)  ( theme music playing )   ( insects chirping )  ( gasps, grunts )  ( gasping )  ( grunts )  ( gasping )  ( coughing, panting )  You could've killed me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The fuck were you doing back there?  Ending the war.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Killing her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You saw the dragon between you and her?  - And? - ( grunts )  Listen to me, cunt.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Till I get what I'm owed,  a dragon doesn't get to kill you,  you don't get to kill you,  only I get to kill you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That was only one of them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She has two more.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  If she decides to use them, to really use them  - You're fucked.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - Don't you mean we're fucked?  No, I do not.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Dragons are where our partnership ends.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm not gonna be around when those things  start spitting fire on King's Landing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I have to tell Cersei.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  May as well jump back in that river.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( men shouting in distance )  ( shouting continues )  ( Drogon screeches )  ( roaring )  I know what Cersei has told you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That I've come to destroy your cities,  burn down your homes,  murder you, and orphan your children.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That's Cersei Lannister, not me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm not here to murder,  and all I want to destroy  is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor  to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I offer you a choice--  bend the knee and join me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Or refuse  and die.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( snarls )  ( roaring )  Step forward, my lord.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You will not kneel?  I already have a queen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Tyrion: My sister.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She wasn't your queen  until recently, though, was she?  When she murdered your rightful queen  and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  There are no easy choices in war.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Say what you will about your sister,  she was born in Westeros.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She's lived here all her life.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You, on the other hand,  murdered your own father  and chose to support a foreign invader.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  One with no ties to this land  with an army of savages at her back.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You will not trade your honor for your life.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I respect that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Perhaps he could take the Black, Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He'd be invaluable at the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You cannot send me to the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You are not my queen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You will have to kill me, too.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Step back and shut your mouth.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Who are you?  A stupid boy.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I am Dickon Tarly,  son of Randyll Tarly.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You are the future of your house.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Don't let it happen again.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 Bend the knee.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I will not.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Your Grace, nothing scrubs bold notions from a man's head  like a few weeks in a dark cell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I meant what I said.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm not here to put men in chains.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  If that becomes an option, many will take it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I gave them a choice.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They made it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Your Grace, if you start beheading entire families--  I'm not beheading anyone.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( roaring )  Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Daenerys: Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly,  I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name,  Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons,  sentence you to die.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Dracarys.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( both screaming )  - ( man shouts ) - ( Drogon roaring )  ( door closes )  My-- my lord  How many men did we lose?  We haven't done a full accounting.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It's not only armies that win wars.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We can buy mercenaries.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Not the same as our men, but they'll fight  if they're well paid, which they will be.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I just saw the Dothraki fight.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They'll beat any mercenary army.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They couldn't stop it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 And she has three of them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  This isn't a war we can win.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  So, what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne,  the father you betrayed and murdered.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And in her mind, she's winning.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?  Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf  by way of apology for murdering our father and son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He didn't.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm not talking about Father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 He had nothing to do with it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - After all this time, it still amazes me that you-- - It was Olenna.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She confessed before she died.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And this was before or after  she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?  After.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And you believed her?  If you were Olenna, would you rather have seen  your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margaery have been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna  the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I shouldn't have listened to you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She should have died screaming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She's dead, like her son,  her grandchildren, her whole house.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And if we don't find a way out of this war, we'll follow them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  So we fight and die or we submit and die.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I know my choice.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  A soldier should know his.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( Drogon screeching )  ( roaring )  ( snarling )  ( snarling stops )  ( exhales )  ( screeching )  They're beautiful, aren't they?  It wasn't the word I was thinking of, but  but, yes, they are.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Gorgeous beasts.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They're not beasts to me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  No matter how big they get  or how terrifying to everyone else,  they're my children.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You weren't gone long.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  No.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And?  And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You're not sure how you feel about that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  No, I'm not.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  How many men did your army kill  taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?  Thousands.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We both want to help people.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We can only help them from a position of strength.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Sometimes strength is terrible.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  When you first came here,  Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Ser Davos gets carried away.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  So, it was a figure of speech?  ( footsteps approaching )      Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,  an old friend.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I served with your father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He was a great man.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You look strong.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You found a cure?  I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I return to your service, my queen,  if you'll have me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It would be my honor.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( ravens cawing )  ( ravens cawing )  ( panting )  Ravens.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We need to send ravens.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I put very little stock in it myself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Prophecies of doom are never in short supply,  especially when winter comes.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I remember Wolkan.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  A little timid, but a sharp mind.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Sandhu: Eh, the North has dulled many good maesters' wits.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Hard to say whether it's the cold, the drink,  - or the company.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - ( all chuckling )  Sandhu: A crippled boy claims to have seen  dead men on the march beyond the Wall,  thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes?  Ebrose: Yes, it is a bit much.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Still, we ought to write back-- - Sam: Brandon Stark.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - The crippled boy.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - Do you know him?  I led him through the Wall years ago.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I saw him go beyond the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And?  Somehow, a crippled boy  survived for years beyond the Wall when no one else could.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Not the Night's Watch, not the wildlings, no one.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?  ( clears throat )  Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  If you tell people the threat is real, they'll believe it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  If you advise all the lords to send their men north  to hold the Wall, they'll do it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel  to search every word of every faded scroll  about the Long Night,  they may find something that lets us defeat  the Army of the Dead for good.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It could be done.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And this news could be authentic.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It's possible.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It's also possible that this message  is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen  to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending  to open those lands to easy conquest.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Sandhu: That does seem far more likely  than magic birds talking to cripples.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Archmaester, please.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It's real.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I've seen it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We will write to Maester Wolkan  at Winterfell for clarification.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Archmaester, please-- - That will be all, Tarly.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Maester: It brings to mind the work of Jenny of Oldstones,  the charlatan who claimed descent from the children of the forest.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - ( all chuckling ) - Sandhu: Don't forget the prophet Lodos,  who promised that the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - ( all laugh ) - Ah, Lodos.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive?  I'm afraid so.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Horrible business.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I haven't had the heart to tell him yet.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He's a good lad.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Right.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The ravenry was falling apart the last time I checked.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( slurping )  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That's why they're rulers.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She gave Tarly a choice,  a man who had taken up arms against her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What else could she do?  Not burn him alive alongside his son?  I am her Hand, not her head.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I can't make her decisions for her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That's what I used to tell myself about her father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I was only a purveyor of information.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy--  I'm not the one doing it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  When the pitch of their screams rose higher--  I'm not the one doing it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  When their hair caught fire  and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room--  I'm not the one doing it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( sighs )  Daenerys is not her father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And she never will be  with the right counsel.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You need to find a way to make her listen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Who's that for? - Jon Snow.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Did you read it?  It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What's it say?  Nothing good.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I thought Arya was dead.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I thought Bran was dead.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm happy for you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You don't look happy.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Bran saw the Night King and his army  marching towards Eastwatch.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  If they make it past the Wall  The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years, presumably.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I need to go home.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You said you don't have enough men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We'll fight with the men we have.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Unless you'll join us.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away, she marches in.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Perhaps not.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story  made up by wet nurses to frighten children.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What if we prove her wrong?  I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  So bring the dead to her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I thought that was what we were trying to avoid.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We don't have to bring the whole army.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Only one soldier.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Is that possible?  The first wight I ever saw  was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Bring one of these things down to King's Landing  and show her the truth.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Anything you bring back will be useless  unless Cersei grants us an audience  and is somehow convinced not to murder us  the moment we set foot in the capital.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The only person she listens to is Jaime.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He might listen to me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And how would you get into King's Landing?  I can smuggle you in,  but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you,  I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Well, it will all be for nothing  if we don't have one of these dead men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Fair point.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  How do you propose to find one?  With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Allow me to serve you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The Free Folk will help us.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They know the real north better than anyone.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They won't follow Ser Jorah.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They won't have to.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore, you're King in the North.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm the only one here who's fought them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm the only one here who knows them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I haven't given you permission to leave.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I am a king.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And I came here  knowing that you could have your men behead me  or your dragons burn me alive.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I put my trust in you, a stranger,  because I knew it was the best chance for my people,  for all our people.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger  because it's our best chance.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( all chattering )  Glover: The King in the North should stay in the North.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We did not choose you to rule us, my lady.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - But perhaps we should have.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - ( all murmuring )  The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Men: Aye.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You are very kind, my lords.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  But Jon is our king.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He is doing what he thinks is best.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( chatter )  Sansa: I warned Jon this would happen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That he couldn't leave the North  and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He didn't.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 He trusted you to hold it for him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Well, he's not making it easy.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 The Northern lords are proud.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  These are Mother and Father's chambers.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And?  Nothing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Don't do that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - What? - Say what you mean.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You always liked nice things.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They made you feel better than everyone.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Are you angry with me?  They were insulting Jon,  and you sat there and listened.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I listened to their complaints,  which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Their opinions are important to you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Glover has 500 men, Royce has 2,000.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Offend them and Jon loses his army.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Not if they lose their heads first.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We took it back,  and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods  and the wildlings and the Vale.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  All of us, working together.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying,  but that's not the way you get people to work together.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And if Jon doesn't come back,  you'll need their support  so you can work together  to give you what you really want.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  How can you even think such a horrible thing?  You're thinking it right now.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You don't want to be,  but the thought just won't go away.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I have work to do.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  My lady.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( door opens, closes )  Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The guards hardly ever patrol it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Too many steps.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You're not staying here?  I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What if someone takes the boat?  Then we're fucked.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 Best hurry.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We don't have time for this.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We should be preparing the city for a siege.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The Dothraki are coming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  All the more reason for you to train.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And here I am, ready to train.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Why down here?  I don't think you want people to see  how you look swinging that thing yet.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'll leave you to it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I needed to see you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And I knew you'd never agree to meet.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You made me look like a complete fool.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock,  but you were three steps ahead of me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Abandoned the family home, completely unsentimental.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Father would have been proud.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Don't talk about Father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - Listen to me--  I once told Bronn  that if I ever saw you again, I'd cut you in half.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It'll take you a while with a sparring sword.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He was going to execute me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He knew I was innocent.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He didn't hate me because of anything I did,  he hated me because of what I am.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  A little monster sent to punish him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Did he-- did he think--  did he think I wanted to be born this way?  - Did he think I chose it-- - What do you want?!  Daenerys will win this war.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You're a military man.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You must know there's no way around that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Daenerys is not her father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She's even willing to suspend the hostilities  if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  If you want Cersei to bend the knee,  you can ask her yourself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I-- I don't.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 And Daenerys doesn't.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Not right now, anyway.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She has a more important request.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( chatter )  I wasn't sure I'd find you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Thought you might still be rowing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( chuckles )  I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?  Haven't been here in years.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Nothing fucks you harder than time.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Anybody give you any trouble?  Here I am, arming Lannisters,  and I never get a second look.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  But you were right.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Don't be so sure.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Bad things are coming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You came to get me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 You want me to come with you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Well, the thing you need to understand is--  I'm ready.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - You-- - Let's go.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You should know what you're heading into.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What do you think I've been thinking about  with every swing of the hammer?  How happy I am making weapons  for the family that killed my father?  The family that tried to kill me?  ( scoffs )  I've been getting ready.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I never knew what for,  but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You might want to bring one of those swords.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I don't know much about swinging swords.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  But this  this I know.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Keep your father's name to yourself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Situation's complicated enough already.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Well, who should I say I am?  I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon,  - someone's going to-- - Gold cloak: You there!  No weapons, friends.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 I promise.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What can I do for you?  - Is that your boat? - It is.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Gold cloak: The docks are that way.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - Davos: That they are.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I try to stay away from them  to avoid good men such as yourselves.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Still five gold dragons? - ( laughs ) Are you joking?  You must be even older than you look.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - 15.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - 15?!  Apiece.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - ( sighs ) - ( coins jingling )  I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Gold cloak #2: What's in the boat?  Not more gold.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Wine? - Mm.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - I like wine.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - Or hams.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Come have a look.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Fermented crab.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - What?  Davos: Fermented crab.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  One bucket of this triples a brothel's earnings for the week.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  A man thinks he's done.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He's ready to go back to his loving family.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  But before he gets his breeches up,  his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Here, have a taste.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'd hurry to your favorite establishment,  or you'll put a hole in that chainmail.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( laughing )  ( chattering )  Oi, dwarf!  I really wouldn't try any more  until you see how the first bite hits you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That dwarf  Where'd you get that scar?  Fish hook.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 Some men you just can't teach.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Davos: Perhaps there's some arrangement?  ( coins jingle )  Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei--  ( grunting )  - ( sighs ) - This is Gendry.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He'll do.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Go, go, go.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Qyburn: I could give you something.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That won't be necessary.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Ser Jaime.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - ( door closes ) - Why was Qyburn here?  He's the Hand of the Queen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 Why are you here?  I met with Tyrion.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What did our brother have to say?  Daenerys wants to meet.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  To discuss her surrender?  To discuss an armistice.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She's just won a great victory.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 Why would she want a truce now?  Because an army of dead men  is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( chuckles )  - Are you going to punish him? - Tyrion?  Bronn.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He betrayed you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Do you think anything of importance  happens in this city without me knowing?  You let it happen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 Why?  I've come to believe that  an accommodation with the Dragon Queen  could be in our immediate interest.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  She has the numbers.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 If we want to beat her, we have to be clever.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We have to fight her like Father would have.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Dead men, dragons, and Dragon Queens  Whatever stands in our way,  we will defeat it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  For ourselves, for our house,  for this.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Who will you say is the father?  You.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  People won't like that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Do you remember what Father used to say about people?  The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Never betray me again.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Davos: We're leaving today.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - The king's got a lot on his mind.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - I understand.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - You don't have to worry.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - You're just Clovis,  a smith who's come to pay his respects  before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Understood.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - ( hammering ) - ( chatter )  Begging your pardon, Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You survived King's Landing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Yet again.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 Your Grace, this is Clo--  Name's Gendry, Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Bastard son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He was meant to keep that to himself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Our fathers trusted each other.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Why shouldn't we?  I saw your father once at Winterfell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I met yours in my shop.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - You're a lot leaner.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - And you're a lot shorter.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I grew up on stories about them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  All I ever knew is that they fought together and won.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Let me come with you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Don't be a fool.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 You're not a soldier.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  No, but I'm a fighter.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You know how to use one?  Well, that's a problem.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I prefer a hammer.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He can handle himself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We could use the help.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  As my father used to say,  "It's better to be a coward for a minute,  than dead for the rest of your life.
s07e05	Eastwatch	"  I owe you my life.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Twice over.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  But if what you said is true about what's up there,  I can't wait out this war.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Yeah, nobody mind me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Man: All right, come on.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( grunts )  Tyrion: You may not believe it,  but I've missed you, Mormont.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Nobody glowers quite like you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Not even Grey Worm.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  This is the coin the slaver gave me  when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?  It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Take it with you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  But bring it back.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Our queen needs you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We should be better at saying farewell by now.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Your Grace, I  If I don't return, at least you won't have to deal  with the King in the North anymore.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I've grown used to him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Heave!  ( fire crackling )  Gilly: Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?  No.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  15,782.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  None anymore.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That's true.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  This High Septon Maynard, he recorded everything.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He even recorded his own bowel movements.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  What does "annulment" mean?  It's when a man sets aside his lawful wife.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Maynard says here that he issued an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"  and remarried him to someone else at the same time  in a secret ceremony in Dorne.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Is that a common thing in the south or--?  These maesters  they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting  and annulments and bowel movements for all eternity,  while the secret to defeating the Night King's  probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere, completely ignored.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  But that's all right, isn't it?  We can all become slavering, murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate  as long as we can have access to the full records  of High Septon Maynard's 15,782 shits!  Steps.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  That number was the steps.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( giggles )  Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - ( whispering ) - ( horse whinnies )  ( dog barking )  ( quiet chatter )  Wolkan: I found it, my lord.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It, uh, took some searching.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Maester Luwin's archives are very thorough.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You're sure this is the only copy in Winterfell?  Uh, yes, my lord.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( door closes, lock clicks )  Tormund: Isn't it your job to talk him out  of stupid fucking ideas like this?  I've been failing at that job of late.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  How many queens are there now?  Two.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And you need to convince the one with the dragons  or the one who fucks her brother?  ( chuckles )  Both.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  How many men did you bring?  Jon: Not enough.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  The big woman?  We were hoping some of your men could help.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  - Hmm.
s07e05	Eastwatch	 - I'll be staying behind.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I'm a liability out there, as you well know.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You are.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You really want to go out there? Again?  You're not the only ones.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Said they were on their way here.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You're the Hound.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I saw you once at Winterfell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They want to go beyond the Wall, too.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Our Lord told us that the Great War is coming--  Gendry: Don't trust him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Don't trust any of them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They're the Brotherhood.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And the last thing their lord told them to do  was sell me to a red witch to be murdered.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Jorah: Thoros?  I hardly recognized you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Ser Jorah Mormont.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  They won't give me anything to drink down here.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  I haven't been feeling like myself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Tormund: You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?  He was my father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  He hunted us like animals.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  You returned the favor, as I recall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( growls )  Here we all are  at the edge of the world  at the same moment,  heading in the same direction for the same reason.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  Our reasons aren't your reasons.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  There's a greater purpose at work.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  And we serve it together,  whether we know it or not.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We may take the steps, but the Lord of Light--  For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole?  Are we coming with you or not?  Don't you want to know what we're doing?  Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell, waiting to die?  He's right.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  We're all on the same side.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  How can we be?  We're all breathing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	  ( gate rumbling )  ( wind howling )
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	1  You alright?  Haven't been North before?  Never seen snow before.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Beautiful, eh? I can breathe again.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Down south the air smells like pig shit.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - You've never been down south.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - I've been to Winterfell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  That's the North.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How do you live up here?  How d'you keep your balls from freezing off?  You've got to keep moving, that's the secret.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Walking's good, fighting's better,  fucking's best.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  There's not a living woman within 100 miles from here.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We've got to make do with what we've got.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  This one is maybe not so smart.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Davos says he's a strong fighter.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - Good.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  That's more important than being smart.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Smart people don't come here looking for the dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  So, you've met this Dragon queen, huh? And?  She will only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You spent too much time with the Free Folk.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 Now you don't like kneeling.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Mance Rayder was a great man.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 Proud man.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The King Beyond the Wall and never bent the knee.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How many of us people died for his pride?  You still mad at us, boy?  - You sold me to a witch.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - A priestess.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We're fighting a great war.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Wars cost money.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - I wanted to be one of you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Like a slave.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You know what she did to me?  She struck me down on the bed, she stripped me naked  Sounds alright so far  And put leeches on me!  - Was she naked too? - She needed your blood.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Yes, thank you, I know that.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - Could've been worse.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  She wanted to kill me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - And would have killed me if it weren't for - But they didn't, did they?  So what you winging about?  I'm not winging.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Your lips are moving and you complain about something.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 That's winging.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  This one has been killed six times and you don't hear him bitching about it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Good lad.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The first time I went north of the Wall, was with your father.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He was a good man.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He deserved a better son.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Were you with him at the end?  I was a prisoner of the wildlings.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But we avenged him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I want you to know that, every mutineer found justice.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Can't think of a worse way for him to go.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The Night's Watch was his life.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 He would have died to protect every one of those men.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And they butchered him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I hate that he died that way.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And my father was the most honorable man I have ever met.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He was good, all the way through.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And he died on the executioner's block.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Your father wanted to execute me, you know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I heard.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It was in the right, of course.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Didn't make me hate him any less.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm glad he didn't catch you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Your father gave me this sword.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But it's still Longclaw.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But you are back.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And it's been in your family for centuries.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's not right for me to have it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He gave it to you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm not his son.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I brought shame onto my house.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I broke my father's heart.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I forfeited the right to claim his sword.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's yours.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  May it serve you well.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And your children after you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Father used to watch us from up here.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He wouldn't say much.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You probably don't remember, you were inside knitting all the time.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I remember.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  One times the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick,  I came out here after  and Bran had left his bow behind,  just lying on the ground.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  There was one arrow in the target  and with no one around, just like now.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  No one to stop me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  So I started shooting.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And every shot I had to go up there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I wasn't very good.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Finally, I've hit the bull's eye.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Could've been the 20th shot.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 Or the 50th.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 I don't remember.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But I hit the bull's eye.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And I heard this.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I looked up.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And he was standing right here, smiling down on me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I knew what I was doing was against the rules  but he was smiling, so I knew it wasn't wrong.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The rules were wrong.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Now he's dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Killed by the Lannisters.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  With your help.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  What?  That's your pretty handwriting.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles cause I couldn't write as well as you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Robb,  I write to you today with heavy heart.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Our good King Robert is dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Killed from wounds he took in a bull - You don't have to read it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - I remember.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - Father has been charged with treason.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey  and tried to steal his throne.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey  and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark  Your faithful sister, Sansa.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - They forced me to do it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - Did they?  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you in a rack and stretched you till your bones started to crack?  You should have known what it was like.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 I was a child.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  So was I.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They told me it was the only way to save father.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And you were stupid enough to believe them.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I remember you, standing on that platform  with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father to the block.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing, the fancy way you did your hair.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - You were there.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - I was there.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Standing in the crown near Baelor's statue.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight with the Lannisters and save father?  - I wanted to.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - But you didn't.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Just like me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - I didn't betray him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 I didn't betray Robb.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I didn't betray my entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You should be on your knees thanking me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back, he lost the Battle of the Bastards.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The Knights of the Vale have won the battle and they rode north for me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  While you were where? Travelling the world?  - I was training.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - Training?  Well, while you were training, I suffered things you can never imagine.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Oh, I didn't know that and I can imagine quite a lot.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You never would have survived what I survived.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I guess we'll never know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  What are you going to do with that letter?  I don't know yet.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?  You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  No one's gonna hang you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 You're scared I'll show it to Jon  - Arya! - and he'll be angry.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Not, that's not Jon.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He'll understand, you were just a scared little girl.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  All alone with the wicked Lannisters.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Do you know how happy Cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants, what she always wanted.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You are scared the Northern lords will read it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They wouldnât think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Are you going to say "But I was just a child"?  You're angry.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'll go with anger.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You're the one they call the dog.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Fuck off.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They told me you were mean.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Were your born mean or you just hate wildlings?  I could not give two shits about wildlings.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Gingers I hate.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Gingers are beautiful.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Kissed by fire.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Just like you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Don't point your fucking finger at me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?  I didn't trip, I was pushed.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Ever since, you've been mean.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Fuck off.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I don't think you're truly mean.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You have sad eyes.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You want to suck my dick, is that it?  - Dick? - Cock.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Ah, dick.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I like it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Bet you do.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Nop, it's pussy for me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I have a beauty waiting for me back in Winterfell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If I ever get back there.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Yellow hair,  blue eyes.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Tallest woman you've ever seen.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Almost as tall as you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Brienne of Tarth?  - You know her? - Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth?  Well, not with her yet.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But I see the way she looks at me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?  You do know her.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We've met.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I want to make babies with her.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Think of them.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Great big monsters.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They conquer the world.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How did a mad fucker like you live this long?  I'm good at killing people.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - You don't look much like him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - Who's that?  Your father.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I suppose you favor your mother.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You knew him?  Of course I did.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  When he was Hand.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He sent me off hunting for the Mountain.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman brought you back.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Thoros has brought me back  six times.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We both serve the same lord.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I serve the North.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The North didn't raise you from the dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The Lord of Light never spoke to me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I don't know anything about him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 I don't know what he wants from me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He wants your life.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Why? - I don't know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  That's what anyone can tell me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 I don't know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  So what's the point of serving a god, none of us knows what he wants?  I think about that all the time.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I don't think it's our purpose to understand.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Except one thing.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We're soldiers.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We have to know what we're fighting for.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit in a throne made of swords.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  So what are you fighting for?  Life.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Death is the enemy.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The first enemy.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And the last.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But we all die.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The enemy always wins.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But we still need to fight him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  That's all I know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You and I won't find much joy while we're here.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But we can keep up the life.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I am the shield that guards the realm of men.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Maybe we don't need to understand anymore than that.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Maybe that's enough.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Aye.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Maybe that's enough.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  That's what I saw in the fire.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  A mountain like an arrow head.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Are you sure?  We're getting close.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Do you know what I like about you?  - I honestly don't.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - You're not a hero.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Oh.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I've been heroic on occasion.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I once charged through the Mud Gate of King's Landing.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I don't want you to be a hero.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Heroes do stupid things and they die.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this  Jon Snow.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They all try to outdo each other.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You can do the stupidest bravest thing  It's interesting, these heroes you name  Drogo, Jorah,  Daarios, even this  Jon Snow  They all fell in love with you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Jon Snow is not in love with me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Oh, my mistake.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He's too little for me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I didnât mean  As heroes go he is quite little.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I know you're brave.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  So  if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  From everything you've told me about her  she'd rather murder me than speak with me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Oh  first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But if we go to the capital,  we'll go with two armies,  we'll go with three dragons,  and anyone touches you,  King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Of course she is.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Are we?  Laying any traps?  If we want to create a new and better world,  I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?  Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You need to inspire a degree of fear.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But fear is all Cersei has.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's all my father had And Joffrey.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It makes their power brittle.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He did.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Aegon built the wheel.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If that's the kind of queen you want to be,  how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?  So we walk into the lion's den?  My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Except yours.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And I promised him  I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Impulsive?  This will be a difficult negotiation.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  My sister is likely to say something provocative.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And?  And you've been known to lose your temper from time to time.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - As all our great leaders do - When have I lost my temper?  Burning the Tarlys for instance.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  That was not impulsive.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  That was necessary.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Perhaps.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - Perhaps.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We had no time to discuss the possibilities  before you ended their possibilities.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I am taking their side.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You need to take your enemy's side  if you're going to see things the way they do.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And you need to see things the way they do  if you're going to anticipate their actions,  respond effectively and beat them.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Which I want you to do very much.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Because I believe in you  and the world you want to build.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But the world you want to build  doesn't get built all at once.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 Probably not in a single lifetime.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How do we ensure your vision endures?  After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?  You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead?  You say you can't have children.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But there are other ways of choosing a successor.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The Night's Watch has one method,  The Iron born folk,  although many flaws  We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush,  and I saw hundred of arrows miss.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But any one of them could have found your heart and end  You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you?  Is this one of the items you've discussed with your brother in King's Landing?  I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Perhaps if you'd planned for the short term,  we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We will discuss the succession  after I wear the crown.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Prepare.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Big fucker.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Do bears have blue eyes?  We have to get him back to Eastwatch.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Flask.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Go on.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You alright?  I just got bit by a dead bear.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Aye.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You did.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Funny old life.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Alright then.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Where did she get it? - I don't know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  She seems very resourceful.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You're worried.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We're asking 20 000 men to fight with us  in the worst winter any of them have ever seen.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The weather will be the least of their problem.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You question their loyalty?  Their loyalty is to Jon.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Jon is not here.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 I haven't heard from him in weeks.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You're the Lady of Winterfell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The King chose you to rule in his absence.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And rule you have.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Wisely.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Ably.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They say that, they respect you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Some may even prefer you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Yes, they turned their backs on Jon  when it was time to retake Winterfell  and then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How far would you trust men like that?  They're all bloody wind vanes.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If they found out I wrote that letter  a woman who's already married not one but two enemies of her House  By the time Jon comes back, he'll have no army left.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Arya is not like them.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  She's your sister.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You may have disagreements, but she would never betray her family.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Is that what she thinks?  I don't know what she thinks.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I don't know her anymore.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Perhaps Lady Brienne can help.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Did she not?  She is.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way,  wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?  She would.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Something I've always wanted to know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Alright.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?  For being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Some of the lads told me about it the next morning.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Sounded like a good scrap.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Aye.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It was a proper scrap.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The Ironborn thought you were some kind of god.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The way you were waving that flaming sword.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Just the drunkest.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Where's the rest of them?  If we wait long enough we will find out.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Go back to Eastwatch.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - I'm not leaving you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - You're the fastest.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Go! Now!  You're faster without the hammer.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 Give it!  Give it!  Stop!  Go!  What happened?  Where are the others?  Raven.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We need to send the raven.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Get the maester! Now!  Thoros?  Thoros!  I say it's one of the better ways to go.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Lord of Light,  show us the way.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Come to us in our darkness and lead your servant into the light.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We have to burn this body.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And all the clothes behind him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Come to us in our darkness.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We'll all freeze soon.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I saw the water.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  When you killed the white walker,  almost all the dead that followed it fell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Why?  Maybe he was the one who turned them.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We can go for the walkers.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Maybe we'll stand a chance.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - No.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  We need to take that thing back with us.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Daenerys is our only chance.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  No.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  There's another.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Kill him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He turned them all.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You don't understand  The Lord brought you back  he brought me back  No one else, just us.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?  Careful, Beric, you've lost your priest.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  This is your last life.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I've been waiting for the end for a long time.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Milady.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Milady.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's an invitation.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  To King's Landing.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Milady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 - I am.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And you will represent my interest at this gathering as you see them.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They invited you, they want you there.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I will not set foot in King's Landing while  Cersei Lannister is queen.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Until then, I'll remain where I belong.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I have work to do here.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's not safe.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Ser Jaime will be there.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You said he treated you honourably before.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm not worried about me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him  whether or not you're here.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And you trust their loyalty?  You trust he hasn't been speaking to them behind your back?  Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  He has become a competent swordsman.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  This is the safest place for me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Milady.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If I abandon you  The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne,  and you won't be travelling on summer roads.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Yes, Milady.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You can't!  The most important person in the world can't fly to the most dangerous place in the world.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Who else can? - No one.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They knew the risk when they left.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You can't win the throne if you're dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You can't break the wheel if you're dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - So what would you have me do? - Nothing.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If you die  we're all lost.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Everyone, everything  You told me to do nothing before and I've listened to you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm not doing nothing again.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Damn cunt.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Oh, fuck.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Fall back!  Fall back!  Come on!  Help me!  Jon!  Go!  Go now! Leave!  Uncle Benjen! How?  You ride for the pass.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Come with me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's not time.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Go!  We'll meet again, Clegane.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Fucking hope not.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's time to go, Your Grace.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  A bit longer.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Not what you're looking for?  I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They're not here now.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - What are these? - My faces.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  - Where did you get them? - In Braavos,  while I was training to be a faceless man.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  What does that mean?  Back in Braavos, before I got my first face,  there was I game I used to play.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 The game of faces.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  It's simple: I ask you a question about yourself  and you try to make a lie sound like the truth.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If you fool me, you win.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If I catch a lie, you lose.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Let's play.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I don't want to play.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How do you feel about Jon being king?  Is there someone else you feel should rule the North instead of him?  Those faces, what are they?  Is that what you should be asking?  Are you sure?  The game of faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Tell me what they are!  We both wanted to be other people when we were younger.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You wanted to be a queen.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I wanted to be a knight  To pick up a sword like father and go off to battle.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Neither of us got to be the other person, did we?  The world doesn't just let girls decide what they are going to be.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  But I can now.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 With the faces I can choose.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I can become someone else.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Speak in their voice, live in their skin.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I can even become you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  To be the Lady of Winterfell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  All I'd need to find out  is your face.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm sorry.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I'm so sorry.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I wish I could take it back.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I wish we'd never go.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I don't.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You have to see it to know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Now I know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  The dragons are my children.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  They're the only children I'll ever have.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	 Do you understand?  We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  And we'll do it together.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You have my word.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Thank you, Dany.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Dany  Who was the last person who called me that?  I'm not sure, was it my brother?  Not the company you want to keep.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Alright.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  Not Dany.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  How about "My Queen"?  I'd  bend the knee but  What about those who swore allegiance to you?  They'll all come to see you for what you are.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  I hope I deserve it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You do.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	  You should get some rest.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Little Theon! Come and get her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (CACKLES MANICALLY)  It's an invitation to King's Landing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You will represent my interests  at this gathering as you see them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  LITTLEFINGER: She's your sister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Arya would never betray her family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  SANSA STARK: She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  With the faces, I can become someone else.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I wonder what it would feel like to be the Lady of Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  All I'd need to find out is your face.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Daenerys will win this war.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If you want Cersei to bend the knee,  you can ask her yourself.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She has a more important request.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing  but a story.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 What if we prove her wrong?  Bring the dead to her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (WALKER SHRIEKING)  Go!  We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Thank you, my queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (THEME SONG PLAYING)   (CHATTER)  (CHATTER CONTINUES)  - BRONN: Oil? - Pitch, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - How many barrels? - 500, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Get 500 more.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Yes, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I still enjoy it when they call me "my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	"  The thrill will fade.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If we live that long.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Men without cocks.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You wouldn't find me fighting in an army  if I had no cock.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What's left to fight for?  Gold?  I spent my life around soldiers.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What do you think they spend that gold on?  Family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Not without a cock, you don't.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Yet, your brother has chosen to side with the cockless.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (TRUMPET BLARES)  - (DISTANT MEN SHRIEKING) - (HOOFBEATS THUNDERING)  (SHRIEKING CONTINUES)  I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  MAN: Archers, stand tall!  - (HORSES NEIGHING) - MAN #2: Cover that wall!  (SEAGULLS SCREECHING)  - How many people live here? - A million, give or take.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That's more people than the entire North crammed into that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Why would anyone want to live that way?  There's more work in the city.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And the brothels are far superior.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (WIGHT SCREECHING)  (SEAGULLS SCREECHING)  CERSEI: Why isn't she with them?  QYBURN: I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  No one has seen her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And the rest of them?  They're on their way to the Dragonpit now.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Including our brother?  Yes, Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If anything goes wrong,  kill the silver-haired bitch first,  then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Come, Ser Gregor.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's time for us to meet our guests.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (DONKEY BRAYING)  MISSANDEI: Why did they build it?  Dragons don't understand the difference  between what is theirs and what isn't.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Land, livestock, children  Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I imagine it was a sad joke at the end.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread,  it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Maybe it still is.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Welcome, my lords.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Your friends arrived before you did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Supporting the enemy, no less.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - Hard to blame you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - Cersei will anyway.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm glad you're alive.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  BRONN: Come on!  You can suck his magic cock later.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What's in there?  Fuck off.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I thought you were dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Not yet.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You came pretty close.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I was only trying to protect her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You and me both.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She's alive.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Arya.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - Where? - Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Who's protecting her if you're here?  The only one that needs protecting  is the one that gets in her way.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It won't be me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  TYRION: Here we are  the heroes of Blackwater Bay.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Strange place for a reunion.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It is, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours  if she ends up on the throne.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You've been thinking about our new queen?  Perhaps you've been reconsidering your allegiances.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Remember my offer  whatever they're paying you, I'll pay double.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And that would be double what now, exactly?  Don't you worry about me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 I'm doing all right.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - Looking after myself.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - TYRION: Are you?  Helping me to arrange this meeting  wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it?  You put yourself at risk.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I put yourself at risk.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 Important difference.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Now, thanks to me,  she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired  of the clever words that pour out their pieholes.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's good to see you again.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Yeah, you, too.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Come on, Pod.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Let's you and me go have a drink  while the fancy folks talk, eh?  I left this shit city  because I didn't want to die in it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Am I going to die in this shit city?  You might.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And this is all your idea.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)  Remember me?  Yeah, you do.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You're even fucking uglier than I am now.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What did they do to you?  Doesn't matter.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That's not how it ends for you, brother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You know who's coming for you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You've always known.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Where is she?  She'll be here soon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Didn't travel with you?  No.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (DRAGONS SCREECHING)  - (SCREECHING) - (WINGS FLAPPING)  (ROARING)  (ROARING)  We've been here for some time.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  My apologies.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We are all facing a unique  EURON: Theon!  I have your sister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If you don't submit to me here, now  I'll kill her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Then why are you talking?  You're the smallest concern here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?  His wasn't even good.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He explained it at the end.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Never explain.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 It always ruins it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We don't even let your kind live  in the Iron Islands, you know?  We kill you at birth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  An act of mercy for the parents.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Perhaps you ought to sit down.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Why?  Sit down or leave.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (LAUGHING)  We are a group of people who do not like one another,  as this recent demonstration has shown.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We have suffered at each other's hands.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We have lost people we love at each other's hands.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If all we wanted was more of the same,  there would be no need for this gathering.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We are entirely capable of waging war against each other  without meeting face-to-face.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So instead, we should settle our differences  and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?  We all know that will never happen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Then why are we here?  This isn't about living in harmony.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's just about living.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The same thing is coming for all of us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  A general you can't negotiate with.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  This is serious.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't think it's serious at all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I think it's another bad joke.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly,  you're asking me for a truce.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Yes.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 That's all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That's all?  Pull back my armies and stand down  while you go on your monster hunt.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Or while you solidify and expand your position.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back  until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You have my word.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The word of a would-be usurper.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  There is no conversation  that will erase the last 50 years.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We have something to show you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (CHAINS RATTLING)  (BOX THUDS)  (SCREECHING)  (GRUNTS)  (SCREECHING)  We can destroy them by burning them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (SCREECHING)  And we can destroy them with dragonglass.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If we don't win this fight,  then that is the fate of every person in the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (GRUNTS)  There is only one war that matters  the Great War.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And it is here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  DAENERYS: I didn't believe it until I saw them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I saw them all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  How many?  A hundred thousand, at least.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Can they swim?  No.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Good.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What are you talking about?  I've been around the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine,  and this  this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm going back to my island.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You should go back to yours.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  When winter's over,  we'll be the only ones left alive.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  CERSEI: He's right to be afraid.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And a coward to run.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If those things come for us,  there will be no kingdoms to rule.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Everything we suffered will have been for nothing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Everything we lost will have been for nothing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The crown accepts your truce.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (SIGHS)  In return, the King in the North will extend this truce.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He will remain in the North where he belongs.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He will not take up arms against the Lannisters.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He will not choose sides.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  DAENERYS: Just the King in the North?  - Not me? - (CERSEI CHUCKLES)  I would never ask it of you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You would never agree to it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I am true to my word.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Or I try to be.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That is why I cannot give you what you ask.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I cannot serve two queens.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And I have already pledged myself  to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Then there is nothing left to discuss.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The dead will come north first.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 Enjoy dealing with them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We will deal with whatever is left of you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's been good to see you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We both saw what just happened.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We both saw that thing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But I'm loyal to the queen,  and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Oh, fuck loyalty!  Fuck loyalty?  This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Talk to the queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And tell her what?  DAVOS: I wish you hadn't done that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm grateful for your loyalty,  but my dragon died so that we could be here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If it's all for nothing,  then he died for nothing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I know!  I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I would have advised it, had you asked.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But have you ever considered  learning how to lie every now and then?  Just a bit?  I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Talk about my father if you want,  tell me that's the attitude that got him killed.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But when enough people make false promises,  words stop meaning anything.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And lies won't help us in this fight.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  TYRION: That is indeed a problem.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Any ideas as to how we might  change that state of affairs?  Only one.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Everyone stays here,  and I go and talk to my sister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't want Cersei to murder me either.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  JON: I did this.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - I should go.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - She'll definitely murder you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I go see my sister alone.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Or we all go home  and we're right back where we started.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - You spoke with her? - At her until she kicked me out.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  A lot of people seem to think that, actually.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm about to step into a room  with the most murderous woman in the world  who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Who's an idiot?  I suppose we should say goodbye,  one idiot to another.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She's your kind of woman  a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That must be difficult for you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  - whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - I didn't know about that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And now you've got them both working towards the same goal,  the goal you've worked towards your entire life  - Cersei, I didn't know.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - the destruction of this family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I am the one preventing that from happening.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She didn't want to bring you words.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She wanted to bring you fire and blood  until I advised her otherwise.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't want to destroy our family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I never have.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You killed our father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  After he sentenced me to death  for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Hate me for it if you want.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I hate myself for it in spite of what he was,  in spite of what he did to me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Oh, poor little man.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Your papa was mean to you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow?  You left us open.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You laid us bare for the vultures,  and the vultures came and tore us apart.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You may not have killed Joffrey,  but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  No one would've touched them if Father was here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - No one would have dared - I have never been more sorry about anything.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I will not hear it, not from you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I will not hear it!  All right.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You love your family,  and I have destroyed it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I will always be a threat.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So put an end to me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If it weren't for me, you'd have a father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If it weren't for me,  you'd have two beautiful children.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I've thought about killing you  more times than I can count.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Do it! Say the word.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (SIGHS)  (PANTS)  I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - I will not - I don't care.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 I loved them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You know I did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It doesn't matter.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Your love doesn't matter.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 Your feelings don't matter.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't care why you did what you did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I only care what it cost us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It cost us our future.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If there's no future, then why are we here?  Why did you allow me to come?  Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Yes, no, not what you hoped for,  but you must have hoped for something.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What did you hope for?  - To make Jon Snow submit to your queen? - Mm, not like this.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - Yes.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - Why?  Because I think  she will make the world a better place.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She knows herself.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She chose an advisor  who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That's the difference between you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't care about checking my worst impulses.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't care about making the world a better place.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Hang the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That thing you dragged here,  I know what it is, I know what it means.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Not at all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  As soon as it opened its mouth,  the world disappeared for me,  right down its black throat.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth  away from the ones who matter most,  away from my family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Get on a boat, take those who matter  You're pregnant.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (SIGHS)  No one is less happy about this than I am.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I know.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I respect what you did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  This place was the beginning of the end for my family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (SPEAKING VALYRIAN)  A dragon is not a slave.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They were terrifying.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Extraordinary.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They filled people with wonder and awe,  and we locked them in here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They wasted away.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They grew small.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And we grew small as well.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We weren't extraordinary without them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We were just like everyone else.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You're not like everyone else.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And your family hasn't seen its end.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You're still here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I can't have children.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Who told you that?  The witch who murdered my husband.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Has it occurred to you she might not have been  a reliable source of information?  You were right from the beginning.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If I had trusted you, everything would be different.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So, what now?  I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And I can't pretend that Cersei  won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We're fucked.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)  My armies will not stand down.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I will not pull them back to the capital.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The darkness is coming for us all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We'll face it together.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And when the Great War is over,  perhaps you'll remember I chose to help  with no promises or assurances from any of you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I expect not.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Call our banners.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  All of them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - (WIND HOWLING) - (CAWING)  LITTLEFINGER: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  No, this is the way he is,  the way he's always been.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He never asked for my opinion.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 Why would he start now?  I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  This is his writing, his signature.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He's bent the knee.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I've heard gossip  that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What does that have to do with anything?  Jon is young and unmarried.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Daenerys is young and unmarried.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You think he wants to marry her?  An alliance makes sense.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Together, they'd be difficult to defeat.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He was named King in the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He can be unnamed.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me,  and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You are family, too.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Would Arya really murder her own sister?  Do you know what she is now?  Do you know what the Faceless Men are?  Only by reputation.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They worship the God of Death, I believe.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I never trust godly men.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They're killers.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And Arya was one of them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What do you think she's after?  She's your sister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You know her far better than I ever could.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives,  I play a little game.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I assume the worst.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What's the worst reason they could possibly have  for saying what they say and doing what they do?  Then I ask myself,  "How well does that reason explain  what they say and what they do?"  So, tell me  what's the worst thing she could want?  She could want me dead  because she thinks I wronged my family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Why did she come to Winterfell?  To kill me  for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?  To provide proof of my betrayals.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  To provide justification after she murders me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And after she murders you,  what does she become?  Lady of Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (WAVES CRASHING)  If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad,  they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And the Unsullied?  We can sail with them to White Harbor,  meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad,  then ride together to Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You have many enemies in the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Thousands fell fighting your father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  All it takes is one angry man with a crossbow.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad  and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The man who killed the conqueror.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  JON: It's your decision, Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But if we're going to be allies in this war,  it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If we sail to White Harbor together,  I think it sends a better message.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I've not come to conquer the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm coming to save the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We sail together.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Jon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Can I speak with you?  All right.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What you did in King's Landing,  what you said  you could've lied to Cersei  about bending the knee to Daenerys.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We went down there to make peace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other  if we're going to fight together.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You've always known what was right.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Even when we were all young and stupid,  you always knew.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Every step you take  it's always the right step.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's not.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It may seem that way from the outside,  but I promise you, it's not true.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I've done plenty of things that I regret.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Not compared to me, you haven't.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  No.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Not compared to you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I always wanted to do the right thing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Be the right kind of person.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But I never knew what that meant.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It always seemed like there's  like there was an impossible choice I had to make.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Stark or Greyjoy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - He was.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - And you betrayed him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Betrayed his memory.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (SIGHS)  But you never lost him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He's a part of you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Just like he's a part of me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But the things I've done  It's not my place to forgive you for all of it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But what I can forgive,  I do.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You don't need to choose.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You're a Greyjoy  and you're a Stark.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  When I was Ramsay's prisoner,  Yara tried to save me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She's the only one  who tried to save me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (SNIFFLES)  She needs me now.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So, why are you still talking to me?  HARRAG: Load up.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Load up, lads.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 Go on.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - (CHATTER) - Tide's coming in.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  All of us chose to follow Yara.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We left the Iron Islands for Yara.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She would never leave one of us behind.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We're not leaving her behind.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Your sister's dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - She's not dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - She's dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - She's our queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - She's your sister, and you left her to die.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I ran from my uncle.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I was a coward.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you?  They say the dead can't swim.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We're going to sail east,  find a nice, quiet island,  kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - We're done with all that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - Who says we are?  Yara did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 She made a pledge.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We're going to find her,  and we're going to set her free.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - (SPITS) - (MEN LAUGH)  Run away, little Theon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's what you do best.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  MAN: He needs to shut his mouth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (MEN CHEERING)  - MAN: Hey! - (MEN LAUGHING)  - (SHOUTS) - MAN #2: Oh, yes!  - MAN #3: That's more like it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - (MEN LAUGHING)  (GRUNTS)  Stay down  or I'll kill you!  (GRUNTS)  I said stay down or I'll kill you!  (SHOUTING)  (GRUNTING)  (GRUNTS)  (SHOUTS)  (GRUNTING)  (PANTS)  Not for me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  For Yara!  MEN: Yara!  Have my sister brought to the Great Hall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Are you sure you want to do this?  It's not what I want.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 It's what honor demands.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And what does honor demand?  That I defend my family from those who would harm us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  All right, then.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Get on with it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You stand accused of murder.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You stand accused of treason.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  How do you answer these charges  Lord Baelish?  My sister asked you a question.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Lady Sansa, forgive me  I'm a bit confused.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Which charges confuse you?  Let's start with the simplest one  you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Do you deny it?  I did it to protect you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You did it to take power in the Vale.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Do you deny it?  Whatever your aunt might have told you  she was a troubled woman.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She imagined enemies everywhere.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents  telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn  when, really, it was you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters,  it was you who started it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Do you deny it?  I know of no such letter.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You conspired with Cersei Lannister  and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned  and later executed on false charges of treason.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - Do you deny it? - I deny it!  None of you were there to see what happened.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  None of you knows the truth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You held a knife to his throat.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You said, "I did warn you not the trust me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	"  You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But that was another one of your lies.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It was yours.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - I've protected you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - Protected me?  By selling me to the Boltons?  If we could speak alone,  I can explain everything.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives,  I play a little game.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I assume the worst.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What's the worst reason you have  for turning me against my sister?  That's what you do, isn't it?  That's what you've always done  turn family against family,  turn sister against sister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa,  and that's what you tried to do to us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Sansa, please.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm a slow learner, it's true.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But I learn.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Give me a chance to defend myself.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I deserve that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I am Lord Protector of the Vale  and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I think not.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Sansa, I beg you!  I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And yet, you betrayed her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I loved you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  More than anyone.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And yet, you betrayed me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  When you brought me back to Winterfell,  you told me there's no justice in the world,  not unless we make it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I will never forget them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Sansa!  (GASPS)  I  JAIME: Our men in King's Landing  will march north in three days' time.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  MAN: It'll take us a fortnight  just to gather supplies for the train.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  JAIME: We don't have a fortnight.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If the North falls, we fall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 Three days.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The remaining forces in the Westerlands  will take the river road east.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town  and march together to Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Ser Jaime.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  My lords, I need a moment with my brother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  MEN: Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - What are you doing? - Preparing the expedition north.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Expedition north?  I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The Starks and Targaryens have united against us,  and you want to fight alongside them?  Are you a traitor or an idiot?  You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy  I'll say whatever I need to say  to ensure the survival of our house.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father?  You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum,  to fight for the Dragon Queen?  You saw it with your own eyes.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I saw it burn.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If dragons can't stop them,  if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them,  how will our armies make a difference?  This isn't about noble houses,  this is about the living and the dead!  And I intend to stay amongst the living.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We stay here where we've always been.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I made a promise.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Our child will rule Westeros.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The monsters are real.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The white walkers,  the dragons, the Dothraki screamers  all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So be it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Let the monsters kill each other.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  And while they battle in the North,  we take back the lands that belong to us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - And then what? - And then we rule.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You understand that, don't you?  If the dead win, they march south and kill us all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  If the living win, and we've betrayed them,  they march south and kill us all!  The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Most of them will die in the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I faced them in the field.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We can't beat them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 We can't beat their dragons.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  How many dragons did you see at the pit?  - Two.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - What happened to the third?  For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!  She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  She came here to show us all her power.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  No, something happened.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 The dragons are vulnerable.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We can't beat the Dothraki.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 We don't have the numbers.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  We don't have the support of the other houses!  No, we have something better.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 We have the Iron Bank.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Oh, I know it's boring for you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But I listened, I learned.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos  the Golden Company.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  20,000 men, horses, elephants, I believe.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The Golden Company is not here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  They're in Essos.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?  Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail  and sailed back to the Iron Islands?  Do you think he abandoned  the chance to marry the queen?  No one walks away from me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He's going to ferry the Golden Company back here  to help us win the war for Westeros.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me,  the commander of your armies?  And you conspired with Tyrion,  the man who murdered our father,  without telling me, your queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I didn't conspire with him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You met with him in secret without my consent.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You planned to promote my enemies' interests.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  That is the definition of conspiracy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I pledged to ride north.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I intend to honor that pledge.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - And that will be treason.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - Treason?  Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What would you call it?  Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I told you no one walks away from me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Are you going to order him to kill me?  I'm the only one you have left.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Our children are gone, our father is gone.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's just me and you now.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  There's one more yet to come.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Give the order, then.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't believe you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (CHATTER)  - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Come in.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Samwell Tarly.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I remember everything.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  (DOOR CLOSES)  You helped us get beyond the Wall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - You're a good man.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 - Oh, well, thank you,  but, um, I'm not sure that I am.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  What happened to you beyond the Wall?  I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Oh!  I don't know what that means.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I can see things that happened in the past.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I can see things happening now  all over the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Why did you come to Winterfell?  Um  Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I know he is.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  But he can't do it alone,  so I've come here to help him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He's on his way back to Winterfell  with Daenerys Targaryen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You you saw this in  in a vision?  Oh.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He needs to know the truth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  The truth about what?  About himself.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  No one knows.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	 No one but me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Jon isn't really my father's son.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He was born in a tower in Dorne.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  His last name isn't really Snow,  it's Sand.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  It's not.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Dornish bastards are named Sand.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Are you certain?  It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I don't know why he'd lie.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Is this something you can see?  Rhaegar and Lyanna: Father, Smith, Warrior,  Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  - I am hers and she is mine - I am his and he is mine  from this day until the end of my days.

s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Are you all right?  It's just strange.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You did the right thing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You did it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  I'm just the executioner.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You passed the sentence.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  You're the Lady of Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  Does that bother you?  I was never going to be as good a lady as you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	  So I had to be something else.

s08e01	Winterfell	  I'll always be grateful for your faith.
s08e01	Winterfell	  But when I left Winterfell,  I told you we need allies or we will die.
s08e01	Winterfell	  I have brought those allies home  to fight alongside us.
s08e01	Winterfell	  I had a choice,  keep my crown or protect the North.
s08e01	Winterfell	  I chose the North.

s08e01	Winterfell	  He risked his life to show us the threat is real.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Thanks to his courage,  we have brought with us the greatest army  the world has ever seen.
s08e01	Winterfell	  We have brought two full-grown dragons.

s08e01	Winterfell	  - Miserable affair.
s08e01	Winterfell	 - It had its moments.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Apologies for leaving like that.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Yes, it was a bit hard to explain  why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.
s08e01	Winterfell	  We both survived.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Many underestimated you.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Most of them are dead now.
s08e01	Winterfell	  I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear  the Lannister army's marching north.
s08e01	Winterfell	  You have every right to be fearful of my sister.
s08e01	Winterfell	  No one fears her more than I do.
s08e01	Winterfell	  - But I promise, you'll be safe - Cersei told you her army  was coming north to fight for you?  She did.
s08e01	Winterfell	  And you believed her?  She has something to live for now.
s08e01	Winterfell	  I believe she wants to survive.

s08e01	Winterfell	  She's the smartest person I've ever met.

s08e01	Winterfell	  Or maybe I cheated.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Someone cheated.

s08e01	Winterfell	  - Horses? - Two thousand.
s08e01	Winterfell	  And elephants?  HARRY: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.
s08e01	Winterfell	  That's disappointing.
s08e01	Winterfell	  I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
s08e01	Winterfell	  HARRY: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace,  but not well-suited to long sea voyages.
s08e01	Winterfell	  In any event, you are most welcome  here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

s08e01	Winterfell	  Apologies for the interruption,  but the queen did urge me to hurry.

s08e01	Winterfell	  - Which girl? - QYBURN: The queen's brothers  made promises to you and broke them.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
s08e01	Winterfell	  She once gave me a castle and a wife,  then rectified me right out of them.
s08e01	Winterfell	  That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.
s08e01	Winterfell	  When Queen Cersei wants something,  she pays in advance and in gold.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Several chests of it, in fact.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.
s08e01	Winterfell	  So she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers.
s08e01	Winterfell	  If it's the Dragon Queen she's after  She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Yeah, well, good luck with that.
s08e01	Winterfell	  Our queen's brothers are unlikely  to survive their Northern adventures.

s08e01	Winterfell	  She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
s08e01	Winterfell	  That fucking family.
s08e01	Winterfell	  QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me,  I thought I would die poor and alone,  but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You still would be,  if you hadn't pushed me out of that window.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And I would still be Brandon Stark.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - You're not? - BRAN: No.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'm something else now.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [RAVEN CAWS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You're not angry at me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'm not angry at anyone.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Why didn't you tell them?  You won't be able to help us in this fight  if I let them murder you first.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  What about afterwards?  How do you know there is an afterwards?  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  SOLDIER 1: Next up.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  SOLDIER 2: Put a marker in the ground!  Bring it up to the wall!  SOLDIER 3: Up to the wall.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 All right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - SOLDIER 4: All right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - SOLDIER 3: All right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  TYRION: Well, here we are.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Yes, here we are.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Together again.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [MAN CLEARS THROAT.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [SPITS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And the masses rejoice.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  How do they feel about their new queen?  She's your new queen too.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They remember what happened  the last time Targaryens brought dragons north.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They'll come around  once they see Daenerys is different.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And she is? Different?  TYRION: She is.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - You're sure about her? - I am.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  She didn't seem sure about you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It's hard to blame her.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I made a mistake common to clever people.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - I underestimated my opponents.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - Hmm.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  A chance for you both to start again.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And I believed her.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  MAN: That stuff can go on the end.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Was she lying about the baby too?  No, that part is real.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  She's fooled me more than anybody.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  CHILD: No, he's right there.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  What?  She never fooled you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You always knew exactly what she was,  and you loved her anyway.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  So  [HORSE NEIGHS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  we're going to die at Winterfell.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Not the death I would've chosen.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I always pictured myself  dying in my own bed,  the age of 80,  - with a belly full of wine and - BOTH: a girl's mouth  - around your cock.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - around my cock.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  At least Cersei won't get to murder me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction  denying her that pleasure  while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [PEOPLE ARGUING.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Maybe after I'm dead  I'll march down to King's Landing  and rip her apart.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  MAN: You will see the Army of the Dead.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 Yes, aim.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [BOTH GRUNT.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Don't rush.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Come forward.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - Come on.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - Ser Jaime.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Lady Brienne.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [SWORDS CLASHING.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - He's come a long way.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - He's all right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  PODRICK: One more time.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 Come on.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - Still has a lot to learn.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - I'm sure you'll teach him.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  PODRICK: Better, better.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I am.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It's, uh It's good ground.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It is.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The rise, it should give us some advantage.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If we can keep a tight formation,  we might be able to beat them back.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [SIGHING.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 Yes, I think you're right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - What are you doing? - What?  - I think you know.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - I truly don't.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We have never had a conversation last this long  without you insulting me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 Not once.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You want me to insult you?  - No! - Good.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I came to Winterfell because  I'm not the fighter I used to be.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  But I'd be honored to serve under your command,  if you'll have me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I better get back.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [DOOR OPENS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JORAH: Forgive me, khaleesi.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [DOOR CLOSES.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Have you done something to offend me?  JORAH: Many things.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Long ago and long forgiven.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  But you did forgive,  despite my failures.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand,  it broke my heart.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  When I named him Hand,  I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You made the right choice.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I didn't.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  His mouth hardly stopped moving  between Volantis and Meereen.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  But the mind behind all those words  He's made mistakes.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Serious mistakes.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  As have we all.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He owns his  and learns from them.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You're advising me to forgive the man  who stole your position?  I am.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And one other suggestion,  if you'll allow me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  ROYCE: The moment we can get the last infantryman  out onto the field, we should shut the gates.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  SANSA: Keep them open for as long as you can.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  There are still people coming in from the countryside.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I thought you and I  were on the verge of agreement before.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  About Ser Jaime.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Brienne has been loyal to me, always.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I trust her more than anyone.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Tyrion is a good man.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He was never anything but decent towards me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I asked him to be my Hand  because he was good, and intelligent,  and ruthless when he had to be.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He never should have trusted Cersei.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You never should have either.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I thought he knew his sister.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Families are complicated.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Ours certainly have been.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  SANSA: A sad thing to have in common.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  DAENERYS: We have other things in common.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We've both known what it means to lead people  who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And we've both done a damn good job of it,  from what I can tell.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Why is that?  Your brother.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He loves you, you know that.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  That bothers you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Men do stupid things for women.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They're easily manipulated.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  All my life, I've known one goal:  the Iron Throne.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Taking it back from the people  who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  My war was against them.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Until I met Jon.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Now I'm here, half a world away,  fighting Jon's war alongside him.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Tell me, who manipulated whom?  [SCOFFS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I should have thanked you the moment you arrived.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  That was a mistake.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'm here because I love your brother  and I trust him  and I know he's true to his word.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He's only the second man in my life  I can say that about.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Who was the first?  Someone taller.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [BOTH CHUCKLE.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And what happens afterwards?  We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  What happens then?  I take the Iron Throne.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  What about the North?  It was taken from us,  and we took it back.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  What about the North?  WOLKAN: Apologies, my lady.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 Your Grace  What is it?  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  THEON: My queen.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Your sister?  She only has a few ships,  and she couldn't sail them here.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  So she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead,  to take them back in your name.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  But why aren't you with her?  I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa  if you'll have me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Milord, we're not soldiers.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You are now.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Look, I made it through most of my years  without ever getting near a fight,  but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Right outside these walls.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If I can live through that, you can live through this.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Right that way.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Thank you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  GILLY: When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They're the safest place to be.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Through that archway right over there.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Thank you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  WOMAN 1: Hey, hey, who's next, lads?  WOMAN 2: Thank you, sir.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 Come back!  TEELA: Which way should I go?  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Which way do you want to go?  All the children will be going below  when the time comes.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  But both me brothers were soldiers.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I want to fight too.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  That's good to hear.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'm going to be in the crypt with my son,  and I'd feel a lot better with you down there  - to protect us.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - I'm sure a lot of people would.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  All right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 I'll defend the crypt, then.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [HORN BLARES.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  MAN: Riders coming in!  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [GRUNTS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 My little crow.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I thought we'd lost you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  TORMUND: Almost.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  MAN: Put them in the stables.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  How did you find each other?  We met up at the Last Hearth.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The dead got there first.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The Umbers?  Fighting for the Night King now.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We had to travel around them to get here.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Whoever's not here now  is with them.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  How long do we have?  Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The big woman still here?  [.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JON: They're coming.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  MAN: Next.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JON: We have dragonglass  and Valyrian steel.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JON: But there are too many of them.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Far too many.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [HORSE NEIGHS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Our enemy doesn't tire.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Doesn't stop.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Doesn't feel.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We can't beat them in a straight fight.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JAIME: So, what can we do?  The Night King made them all.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 They follow his command.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If he falls  Getting to him may be our best chance.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If that's true, he'll never expose himself.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  BRAN: Yes, he will.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He'll come for me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Why?  What does he want?  An endless night.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  SAMWELL: That's what death is, isn't it?  Forgetting.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Being forgotten.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If we forget where we've been  and what we've done,  we're not men anymore.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Just animals.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Your memories don't come from books.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Your stories aren't just stories.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If I wanted to erase the world of men,  I'd start with you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  How will he find you?  His mark is on me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He always knows where I am.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JON: We'll put you in the crypt,  - where it's safest.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - BRAN: No.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We need to lure him into the open  before his army destroys us all.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  SANSA: You want us to use you as bait?  We're not leaving you alone out there.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  He won't be.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 I'll stay with him.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  With the Ironborn.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I took this castle from you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Let me defend you now.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  TYRION: When the time comes,  Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,  to give you the signal to light the trench.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You'll be in the crypt.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Your Grace, I have fought before,  I can do it again.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Alongside the men and women  risking their lives.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  There are thousands of them  and only one of you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You can't fight as well as they can,  but you can think better than any of them.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You're here because of your mind.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If we survive, I'll need it.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We need to be near him.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Not too near,  or the Night King won't come.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  But close enough to pursue him when he does.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Dragonfire will stop him?  I don't know.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  No one's ever tried.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  We're all going to die.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  But at least we die together.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Let's get some rest.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Your Grace.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You've had a strange journey.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Stranger than most.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'd like to hear about it.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It's a long story.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  If only we were trapped in a castle  in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You need me out there.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Well, if that's what it's come to,  - we really are fucked.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JAIME: Mm.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You were a golden lion.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I was a drunken whoremonger.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It was all so simple.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It wasn't so simple.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I was sleeping with my sister  and you had one friend in the world  who was sleeping with his sister.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I was speaking in relative terms.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - Do you miss it? - Of course I miss it.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Well, my golden-lion days are done,  but whoremongering is still an option for you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [SIGHS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It's not.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Things would be easier if it were.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The perils of self-betterment.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 - Thank you, milord.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I don't think that's wise.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The battle might start at any moment.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Half cup.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - And you? - BRIENNE: No, thank you.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I should try and get some sleep.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  JAIME: You really think any of us  are going to sleep tonight?  Join us.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  All right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Just a bit.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  DAVOS: Well, what do we have here?  Ser Davos, join us.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  No, not for me, thanks.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Came here for this.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [SIGHS.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 I figured I could wait to die  freezing my balls off out there  or wait to die nice and warm in here.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It could be our last night in this world, you know.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  [STAMMERING.]

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Would you like a drink?  Brought my own.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They call you "King Killer.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	"  I'm sure someone does.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They call me "Giantsbane.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	"  Want to know why?  I killed a giant when I was 10.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  When she woke up, you know what she did?  Suckled me at her teat for three months.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Thought I was her baby.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  That's how I got so strong.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Giant's milk.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You never used to shut up.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Guess I've changed.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  What are you doing up here?  What's it look like?  No, I mean, what are you doing up here?  You joined the Brotherhood.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You went beyond the Wall with Jon.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  You're here now.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 Why?  When was the last time  you fought for anyone but yourself?  I fought for you, didn't I?  Oh, for fuck's sake.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  May as well be at a bloody wedding.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  My lady.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  It's good to see you again.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Was he on your list?  For a little while.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  That's all right.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  This is his moment.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  - When light - Thoros isn't here anymore,  so I hope you're not about to give a sermon.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Because if you are,  the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times  just to watch you die when I chuck you  over this fucking wall.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	 [CHUCKLES.]
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Where are you going?  I'm not spending my final hours  with you two miserable old shits.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  ARYA: That for me?  This'll work.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Last time you saw me,  you wanted me to come to Winterfell.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Took the long road, but  What did the Red Woman want with you?  She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Why your blood?  I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  I didn't know until she told me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Then she tied me up, stripped me down,  put leeches all over me.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Was that your first time?  No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Your first time with a woman.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  GENDRY: What?  I I didn't I wasn't with her.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it.

s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  They were married in secret.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,  she had a son.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  Robert would have murdered the baby  if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it.
s08e02	A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms	  So the last thing she did  as she bled to death on her birthing bed  was give the boy to her brother  Ned Stark  to raise as his bastard.

s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't really want anymore.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I envy you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You shouldn't envy me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Mostly I live in the past.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - TORMUND: All of it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - Go on.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - No, not in one go.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - Go on.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 I believe in you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TORMUND: We have to celebrate our victory.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Vomiting is not celebrating.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Yes, it is.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Ah!  To the Dragon Queen!  [ALL CHEER.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!  [ALL CHEERING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! - WOMAN: Drink!  [CROWD BARKING IN RESPONSE.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [ROARS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [GRUNTS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TORMUND: I'm fine!  [TORMUND CACKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [TORMUND EXCLAIMS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [TORMUND EXCLAIMS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Your turn.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Um  You are an only child.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - I told you I was.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - You didn't.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - I did.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - I surmised it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Go again.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Why does he get to go again?  Because it's my game.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You have danced with Renly Baratheon.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TYRION: Drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN: The other way around!  I saw him riding that thing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - We all did.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - No.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 No.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I saw him riding that thing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - That's right, you did.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - I did.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's why we all agreed to follow him.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's the kind of man he is.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He's little  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  but he's strong.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Strong enough to befriend an enemy  and get murdered for it!  Most people get bloody murdered,  they stay that way.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - [GRUNTS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - TORMUND: Not this one.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [MEN LAUGHING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He keeps fighting.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 He keeps fighting.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon?  A madman or a king!  [CROWD CHEERING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - TYRION: Drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - Drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [LAUGHING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [MEN SINGING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Wrong!  Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!  [BOTH LAUGHING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Mm!  You were married.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Before Sansa.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - [GROWLS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!  No!  [LAUGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're a virgin.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's a statement about the present.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  At no point in the past, up until this very moment,  have you slept with a man.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Or a woman.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I have to piss.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We did it! We faced those icy fucks.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Looked right into their blue eyes,  and here we are.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [SIGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?  [GUFFAWS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Please pardon me for a moment.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN: Drink it!  And after all that,  this fucker comes north and takes her from me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Just takes her, like that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I mean it, Clegane.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  My heart is broken.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Don't touch me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  WILLA: You can touch me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm not afraid of wildlings.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Maybe you should be.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [TORMUND CHUCKLING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Well, Clegane  it's time to drown our sorrows.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm not done with my drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - [SIGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - MAN 2: You saved the day.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN 1: You owe me one.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Don't forget that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - MAN 2: For the rest of my days.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Are you ready now?  This is my drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [GROWLING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 All right!  SANSA: She could have made you happy, for a little while.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  There's only one thing that'll make me happy.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And what's that?  That's my fucking business.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Used to be you couldn't look at me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That was a long time ago.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've seen much worse than you since then.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  HOUND: Yes, I've heard.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Heard you were broken in.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Heard you were broken in rough.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And he got what he deserved.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I gave it to him.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  How?  Hounds.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You've changed, Little Bird.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  None of it would have happened  if you'd left King's Landing with me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No Littlefinger, no Ramsay  none of it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Without Littlefinger, and Ramsay and the rest,  I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [ALL LAUGHING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - MAN 1: Hey! - MAN 2: Pour another one.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [GASPS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Don't shoot.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You should be celebrating with them.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I am celebrating.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Yeah, I am too.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  By order of the queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Congratulations.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't know how to be lord of anything.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I hardly know how to use a fork.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  All I know is that you're beautiful,  and I love you,  and none of it will be worth anything  if you're not with me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  So be with me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Be my wife.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Be the Lady of Storm's End.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You'll be a wonderful lord,  and any lady would be lucky to have you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  But I'm not a lady.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I never have been.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's not me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [BOWSTRING CREAKS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 [ARROW THWACKS WOOD.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [THUMPING ON DOOR.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [WIND WHISTLING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You didn't drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - I didn't drink? - In the game.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - I drank.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - In the game.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 This is Dornish.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  This is not the game.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 This is only drinking.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Suit yourself.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You keep it warm enough in here.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Keep your fire going.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's very diligent.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Very responsible.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Piss off.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - You know the first thing  I learned in the North?  I hate the fucking North.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It grows on you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't want things growing on me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  How about Tormund Giantsbane?  Has he grown on you?  He was very sad when you left.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You sound quite jealous.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I do, don't I?  It's bloody hot in here.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Oh, move aside.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What are you doing?  I'm taking your shirt off.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've never slept with a knight before.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've never slept with anyone before.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Then you have to drink.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Those are the rules.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I told you--  [WIND WHISTLING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Are you drunk?  No.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Only a little.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [SIGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I didn't know Ser Jorah well  but I know this.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If he could have chosen a way to die,  it would have been protecting you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He loved me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And I couldn't love him back.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Not the way he wanted.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Not the way I love you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Is that all right?  [SIGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I wish you'd never told me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I try to forget.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Tonight I did for a while,  and then I saw them gathered around you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I saw the way they looked at you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I know that look.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  So many people have looked at me that way, but never here.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Never on this side of the sea.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I told you I don't want it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It doesn't matter what you want.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You didn't want to be King in the North.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What happens when they demand you press your claim,  and take what is mine?  I'll refuse.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You are my queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 I don't know what else I can say.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You can say nothing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  To anyone, ever.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Never tell them who you really are.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,  and tell no one else.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Or it will take on a life of its own  and you won't be able to control it  or what it does to people.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No matter how many times you bend the knee,  no matter what you swear.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I want it to be the way it was between us.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I have to tell Sansa and Arya.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She won't.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She's not the girl you grew up with.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Not after what she's seen,  not after what they've done to her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I owe them the truth.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Even if the truth destroys us?  - It won't.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - It will.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've never begged for anything  but I'm begging you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [SOFTLY.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Don't do this.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Please.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You are my queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Nothing will change that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And they are my family.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We can live together.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We can.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've just told you how.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [SIGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Half are gone.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The Northmen as well.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing,  courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The balance has grown distressingly even.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  When the people find out what we have done for them,  that we saved them--  Cersei will make sure they don't believe it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We will hit her hard.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We will rip her out root and stem.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The objective here is to remove Cersei  without destroying King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  VARYS: Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands  in her queen's name.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No matter how many lords turn against her,  as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,  she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We need the capital.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I watched the people of King's Landing  rebel against their king when they were hungry,  and that was before winter began.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  JON: We'll surround the city.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food,  the dragons will destroy them.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack,  we'll defeat them in the field.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy,  her reign is over.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  All right.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  SANSA: The men we have left are exhausted.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Many of them are wounded.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  They'll fight better if they have time  to rest and recuperate.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  How long do you suggest?  SANSA: I can't say for certain,  not without talking to the officers.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I came north to fight alongside you  at great cost to my armies and myself.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Now that the time has come to reciprocate,  you want to postpone.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It's not just our people.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 It's yours.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You want to throw them into a war  they're not ready to fight?  The longer I leave my enemies alone,  the stronger they become.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The Northern forces will honor their promises  and their allegiance  to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What you command, we will obey.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TYRION: So  if all are in agreement  Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad  with the Northern troops  and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor,  and sail from there to Dragonstone  with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,  as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We have won the Great War.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Now we will win the Last War.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  In all Seven Kingdoms,  men will live without fear and cruelty  under their rightful queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We need a word.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You understand we'd all be dead if not for her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Arya's the one that killed the Night King.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--  And we will never forget them.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--  I swore myself and the North to her cause.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I respect that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You respect it?  We needed her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We needed her army, her dragons.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You did the right thing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And we're doing the right thing telling you  we don't trust your queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - You don't know her yet.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - I'll never know her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She's not one of us.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If you only trust the people you grew up with,  you won't make many allies.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's all right.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't need many allies.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - JON: Arya - We're family.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The four of us.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The last of the Starks.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've never been a Stark.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  SANSA: You are.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're my brother.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Not my half-brother or my bastard brother.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  My brother.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It's your choice.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I need to tell you something.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What is it?  You have to swear it, before I tell you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  How can I promise to keep a secret  if I don't even know what it is?  Because we're family.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Swear it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I swear it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I swear it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Tell them.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TYRION: So she's going to stay here with you?  She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so  Say something snide.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm happy.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm happy that you're happy.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [LAUGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes?  To climbing mountains.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 [CUPS CLINK.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  To climbing mountains.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - What's she like down there? - What?  That's not your concern.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I haven't been with a woman for years.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Give me a morsel.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - You're a dog.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I am the Imp, and I demand to know.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  BRONN: I knew you were fucking her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  A pair of tall, blond toffs.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Must be like looking in the mirror.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Where's your drink?  What are you-- What are you doing up North?  What are you doing with that?  Oh, this?  This is for you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  For both of you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TYRION: You're supposed to be south.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Do you know that? - That's a bit rude.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit,  - and what do I have to show? - You're a knight, thanks to me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Thanks to me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 And that title's worth as much  as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Power resides where men believe--  BRONN: Shut your mouth.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - TYRION: I'm just trying-- - I've never hit a dwarf before,  but say another word and I will belt you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--  You couldn't do it on your best day,  you one-handed fuck.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And your best days are long gone.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [GROANS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 You broke my nose!  - I did not break your nose.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - How do you know?  Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size,  and I know what it sounds like.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Now listen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Your sister offered me Riverrun.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Nice big castle, good lands,  plenty of peasants who do what they're told.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - And you trust Cersei-- - I knew your sister was dead  the second I saw those dragons.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Now, your army may be torn to shit,  but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And it just so happens I'm a betting man.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Mmm, that's good.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Of course, the odds change  if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - All of a sudden - TYRION: May I speak?  Why not? Only death will shut you up.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We made a deal long ago.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Do you remember?  If anyone offered me money  to kill you, you'd pay me double.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What's double Riverrun?  Highgarden.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You could be Lord of the Reach.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - Highgarden? Are you mad? - It's better than being dead.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He's not going to kill us.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He wouldn't be talking to us if--  The way I see it,  I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  BRONN: No? Who were your ancestors,  the ones who made your family rich?  Fancy lads in silk?  They were fucking cutthroats.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's how all the great houses started, isn't it?  With a hard bastard who was good at killing people.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Kill a few thousand, they make you king.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family  with their cocksucking ways.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Highgarden.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Give me your word.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You have my word.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We ride south in the morning.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We could use an officer  with knowledge of the city's defenses.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Oh, no.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No, my fighting days are done.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me?  I'll come find you when the war is done.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Till then, don't die.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [DOOR CLOSES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  For fuck's sake.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  On your own?  HOUND: Not anymore.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't like crowds.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  ARYA: Me neither.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  HOUND: Why not? They all love you now.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're the big hero.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Don't like heroes.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Felt better than dying.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're heading to King's Landing?  I have some unfinished business.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Me too.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't plan on coming back.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Neither do I.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?  Probably.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [GROWLING SOFTLY.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  My lady.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  "My lord" is the standard response.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Why her?  TYRION: You know she loves your brother.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You seem determined to dislike her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  A good relationship  between the Iron Throne and the North  has been the core of every peaceful,  prosperous reign we've ever known.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Jon will be Warden of the North,  so a good relationship seems likely.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Well, I suppose that's up to him.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Sansa, look at me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  With Jon in the capital,  you'll be the true power in the North.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'd feel much better about the future  if I left here today believing  that you and Daenerys were allies.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Your queen still has her dragons--  She's your queen too.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You don't have to be her friend.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  But why provoke her?  How is that in the best interest of your family,  - or the North, or--? - You're afraid of her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't want Jon to go down there.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The men in my family don't do well in the capital.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No, but as your brother once told me,  he's not a Stark.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [SIGHS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Are you all right?  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Her people love her, you've seen that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You've seen how they fight for her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She wants to make the world a better place.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I believe in her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Tyrion.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What if there's someone else?  Someone better?  You're not gonna ride the dragon south?  Just a horse.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Rhaegal needs to heal.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He doesn't need me weighing him down.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [SCOFFS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm taking the Free Folk home.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We've had enough of the south.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The women down here don't like me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  This is the North, you know.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It isn't home.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We need room to wander.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'll take them back through Castle Black  as soon as the winter storms pass.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Back where we belong.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It's where he belongs too.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  A direwolf has no place in the south.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Will you take him with you?  He'll be happier up there.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  So would you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I wish I was going with you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  This is farewell, then.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You never know.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You've got the North in you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The real North.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer  and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  There's only so many books a person can read, so we--  I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I hope it's a girl.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [SNIFFLES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [BOTH SNIFFLE.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're the best friend I ever had.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You too, Sam.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [GHOST WHINES.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TYRION: Think of the past 20 years.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The war, the murder, the misery.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone  who didn't love him back.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  How many others know?  Including us? Eight.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Well, then it's not a secret anymore.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It's information.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Then what happens?  She loses the North.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No, it's worse than that.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He has the better claim to the throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He doesn't want the throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'm not sure it matters what he wants.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The fact is, people are drawn to him.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Wildlings, Northmen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He's a war hero.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He loves our queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And she loves him.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If we marry them, they could rule together.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She's his aunt.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That never stopped a Targaryen before.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Is marrying your aunt common in the North?  You know our queen better than I do.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Do you think she wants to share the throne?  She does not like to have her authority questioned.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Something she has in common  with every monarch who ever lived.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I worry about her state of mind.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We are advisors to the queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Worrying about her state of mind is our job.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We still have to take King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That would solve our problems.

s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Missandei!  Missandei!  [GASPS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  CERSEI: Our message was well-received, then?  QYBURN: Your people have heard the Usurper is coming.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  They are grateful for your protection  within the walls of the Red Keep.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're certain about the dragon?  I saw it sink beneath the waves.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That must have been glorious.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  The glory is yours, my queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land,  the Kraken shall rule the sea  and our child shall one day rule them all.

s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 She's coming for you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Of course she is.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Keep the gates open.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder  thousands of innocent people first.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  So much for "the Breaker of Chains.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	"  [MISSANDEI PANTING.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We will kill your enemies.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 All of them.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  VARYS: Your Grace.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly  if I ever thought you were making a mistake.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  This is a mistake.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You saw my child fall from the sky.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  They took Missandei.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed,  but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied  and the Dothraki,  tens of thousands of innocents will die.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  These are the people you came here to protect.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I beg you, Your Grace.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Do not destroy the city you came to save.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys?  I'm here to free the world from tyrants.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That is my destiny  and I will serve it, no matter the cost.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies  make it to King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Offer her her life in exchange for the throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter,  we should make the effort.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  But perhaps it's good the people see  that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed,  and Cersei Lannister refused.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  They should know whom to blame  when the sky falls down upon them.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've served tyrants most of my life.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  They all talk about destiny.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones  and walked out with three dragons.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  How could she not believe in destiny?  Perhaps that's the problem.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Her life has convinced her  that she was sent here to save us all.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And how do you know she wasn't?  Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Perhaps it's actually a solution.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You know them both.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?  He doesn't want the throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  That's why he bent the knee.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Have you considered the best ruler  might be someone who doesn't want to rule?  We're discussing treason.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Of course I've thought about it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Thoughts aren't treason.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He's temperate and measured.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 He's a man,  which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros,  whose support we are going to need.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Joffrey was a man.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't think a cock is a true qualification,  as I'm sure you'd agree.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  And he's the heir to the throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Yes, because he's a man.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 Cocks are important, I'm afraid.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What about my earlier proposal?  They could rule together as king and queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She's too strong for him.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  He could temper her worst impulses.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  As you have?  You're drinking quite a lot.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able  to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  How many kings and queens have you served?  Five? Six? I've lost count.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  - You've always known my reasons.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 - At a certain point,  you choose a person you believe in,  and you fight for that person.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Even if you know it's a mistake?  I believe in our queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  She'll make the right choice.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  With the help of her loyal advisors.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You know where my loyalty stands.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You know I will never betray the realm.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What is the realm?  A vast continent, home to millions of people,  most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Millions of people, many of whom will die  if the wrong person sits on that throne.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  We don't know their names,  but they're just as real as you and I.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  They deserve to live.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  They deserve food for their children.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  So, what happens to her?  Please.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Don't.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I've spoken as honestly as I can.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Each of us has a choice to make.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I pray we choose wisely.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [MAN GRUNTS.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN 1: I'm just about to start it.

s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN 3: He's headed down to the cellar.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I'll need a cart over here.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN 4: That's it, thanks.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Thank you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  WOMAN 2: It's really heavy, mind you.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN 5: We need some more water.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  MAN 3: Take it down there!  as are the rest of her advisors.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  What happened?  Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed,  Missandei captured.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.

s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  JAIME: Have you ever run away from a fight?  You're not like your sister.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	 You're not.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're better than she is.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You're a good man and you can't save her.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You don't need to die with her.

s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  [.]
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You think I'm a good man?  I pushed a boy out a tower window,  crippled him for life  for Cersei.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I strangled my cousin with my own hands  just to get back to Cersei.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I would have murdered  every man, woman and child in Riverrun  for Cersei.

s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Yes.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Help me.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't want to see this city burn.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  No, it is not a pleasant sound.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  I-- I don't want to hear it.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Help me save this city.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  TYRION: Your queen.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You are her subject.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  Her reign is over.
s08e04	The Last Of The Starks	  You understand this.

s08e05	The Bells	  ARYA STARK: You heading to King's Landing?  THE HOUND: There's some unfinished business.
s08e05	The Bells	  ARYA: Me too.
s08e05	The Bells	  THE HOUND: I don't plan on coming back.
s08e05	The Bells	  Neither do I.

s08e05	The Bells	  (SOBS)  I need to tell you something.
s08e05	The Bells	  But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
s08e05	The Bells	  What if there's someone else? Someone better.
s08e05	The Bells	  At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in,  and you fight for that person.
s08e05	The Bells	  Even if you know it's a mistake?  He has the better claim to the throne.
s08e05	The Bells	  CERSEI LANNISTER: Every time a Targaryen is born,  the gods flip a coin.
s08e05	The Bells	  BARRISTAN SELMY: The Mad King gave his enemies the justice  he thought they deserved.

s08e05	The Bells	 - JORAH MORMONT: You have a gentle heart.

s08e05	The Bells	  Of course they are.
s08e05	The Bells	 That's their job.
s08e05	The Bells	  What have I told you, Martha?  The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

s08e05	The Bells	  They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days.
s08e05	The Bells	  How is she?  She hasn't seen anyone since we returned.
s08e05	The Bells	  Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.
s08e05	The Bells	  She shouldn't be alone.
s08e05	The Bells	  You're worried for her.
s08e05	The Bells	 I admire your empathy.
s08e05	The Bells	  Aren't you worried for her?  I'm worried for all of us.
s08e05	The Bells	  They say every time a Targaryen is born,  the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.
s08e05	The Bells	  We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
s08e05	The Bells	  We both know what she's about to do.
s08e05	The Bells	  [SIGHS.]
s08e05	The Bells	  That's her decision to make.
s08e05	The Bells	 She is our queen.
s08e05	The Bells	  Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.
s08e05	The Bells	  What do you want?  All I've ever wanted.
s08e05	The Bells	  The right ruler on the Iron Throne.
s08e05	The Bells	  I still don't know how her coin has landed.
s08e05	The Bells	  But I'm quite certain about yours.
s08e05	The Bells	  I don't want it.
s08e05	The Bells	  I never have.
s08e05	The Bells	  [SIGHS.]
s08e05	The Bells	  I have known more kings and queens than any man living.
s08e05	The Bells	  I've heard what they say to crowds,  and seen what they do in the shadows.
s08e05	The Bells	  I have furthered their designs, however horrible.
s08e05	The Bells	  But what I tell you now is true:  You will rule wisely and well, while she--  She  is my queen.
s08e05	The Bells	  [.]
s08e05	The Bells	  [EXHALES SOFTLY.]
s08e05	The Bells	  Your Grace?  There's something you need to know.
s08e05	The Bells	  Someone has betrayed me.
s08e05	The Bells	  Yes.
s08e05	The Bells	  Jon Snow.
s08e05	The Bells	  Varys.
s08e05	The Bells	  He knows the truth about Jon.
s08e05	The Bells	  He does.
s08e05	The Bells	  Because you told him.
s08e05	The Bells	  You learned from Sansa.
s08e05	The Bells	  And she learned from Jon,  though I begged him not to tell her.
s08e05	The Bells	  As I said  he betrayed me.
s08e05	The Bells	  TYRION: I'm glad Sansa told me.
s08e05	The Bells	  I am your Hand.
s08e05	The Bells	  I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
s08e05	The Bells	  And Varys?  Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
s08e05	The Bells	  You spoke to him first.
s08e05	The Bells	  Without coming to me.
s08e05	The Bells	  Without asking my permission.
s08e05	The Bells	  It was a mistake.
s08e05	The Bells	  Why do you think Sansa told you?  What do you think she hoped to gain?  - She trusts me.
s08e05	The Bells	 - Yes, she trusts you.
s08e05	The Bells	  She trusted you to spread secrets  that could destroy your own queen.
s08e05	The Bells	  And you did not let her down.
s08e05	The Bells	  [.]
s08e05	The Bells	  If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me.
s08e05	The Bells	  Our intentions were good.
s08e05	The Bells	  We wanted what you want.
s08e05	The Bells	 A better world, all of us.
s08e05	The Bells	  Varys as much as anyone.
s08e05	The Bells	  But it doesn't matter now.

s08e05	The Bells	  I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,  First of My Name,  Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons  sentence you to die.

s08e05	The Bells	  This was all she brought with her  when we crossed the Narrow Sea.
s08e05	The Bells	  Her only possession.
s08e05	The Bells	      happen if you told your sister?  I don't want it, and that's what I told him.
s08e05	The Bells	  She betrayed your trust.
s08e05	The Bells	  She killed Varys as much as I did.
s08e05	The Bells	  This was a victory for her.
s08e05	The Bells	  Now she knows what happens  when people hear the truth about you.
s08e05	The Bells	  Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.
s08e05	The Bells	  I don't have love here.
s08e05	The Bells	  I only have fear.
s08e05	The Bells	  I love you.
s08e05	The Bells	  And you will always be my queen.
s08e05	The Bells	  Is that all I am to you?  Your queen?  [JON EXHALES HEAVILY.]
s08e05	The Bells	  [SOFTLY.]
s08e05	The Bells	 All right, then.
s08e05	The Bells	  Let it be fear.
s08e05	The Bells	  TYRION: The people who live there, they're not your enemies.
s08e05	The Bells	  They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.
s08e05	The Bells	  DAENERYS: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters  and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.
s08e05	The Bells	  TYRION: They're afraid.
s08e05	The Bells	  Anyone who resists Cersei  will see his family butchered.
s08e05	The Bells	  You can't expect them to be heroes.
s08e05	The Bells	  - They're hostages.
s08e05	The Bells	 - They are.
s08e05	The Bells	  In a tyrant's grip.
s08e05	The Bells	 Whose fault is that? Mine?  What does it matter whose fault it is?  Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
s08e05	The Bells	  Your sister knows how to use  her enemies' weaknesses against them.
s08e05	The Bells	  That's what she thinks our mercy is:  weakness.
s08e05	The Bells	  - I beg you, my queen-- - But she's wrong.
s08e05	The Bells	  Mercy is our strength.
s08e05	The Bells	  Our mercy towards future generations  who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
s08e05	The Bells	  Ready the Unsullied.
s08e05	The Bells	  Tonight you sail for King's Landing  - to join the Northern armies.
s08e05	The Bells	 - Cersei's followers  will abandon her if they know the war is lost.
s08e05	The Bells	  Give them that chance.
s08e05	The Bells	  - [INHALES SHARPLY.]
s08e05	The Bells	 - If the city surrenders,  they will ring the bells and raise the gates.
s08e05	The Bells	  Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.
s08e05	The Bells	  DAENERYS: Wait for me outside the city.
s08e05	The Bells	  You'll know when it's time.
s08e05	The Bells	  DAENERYS: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
s08e05	The Bells	  [.]
s08e05	The Bells	  It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all.
s08e05	The Bells	  The next time you fail me  will be the last time you fail me.

s08e05	The Bells	  SOLDIER 1: Careful with that.
s08e05	The Bells	 SOLDIER 2: My lord.
s08e05	The Bells	  TYRION: Davos.
s08e05	The Bells	  I need to ask you a favor.
s08e05	The Bells	  You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?  I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?  SOLDIER 1: He's always better when he's got some food in him.
s08e05	The Bells	  SOLDIER 2: Problem is when he's got drink in him.
s08e05	The Bells	  See what he did the other week?  SOLDIER 1: Aye.
s08e05	The Bells	 Fighting as well.
s08e05	The Bells	  Commander nearly caught him.
s08e05	The Bells	  Ay up.
s08e05	The Bells	 Where you going?  I'm Arya Stark.
s08e05	The Bells	  I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
s08e05	The Bells	  Think about it.
s08e05	The Bells	  She kills Cersei, the war's over.
s08e05	The Bells	  There won't be a siege.
s08e05	The Bells	 You might not even die tomorrow.
s08e05	The Bells	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e05	The Bells	  I need to go talk to my captain.
s08e05	The Bells	  Go ahead, talk to him.
s08e05	The Bells	  SOLDIER 1: Where's he going?      [CLEARS THROAT.]
s08e05	The Bells	    We speak the common tongue.
s08e05	The Bells	  Ah.
s08e05	The Bells	 Good.
s08e05	The Bells	  I want to be alone with the prisoner.
s08e05	The Bells	  Get some rest.
s08e05	The Bells	 Tomorrow will be a long day.
s08e05	The Bells	  UNSULLIED: We have orders to guard the prisoner.
s08e05	The Bells	  Ordered by whom? The queen herself?  - No.
s08e05	The Bells	 - TYRION: Well, in that case,  as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order.
s08e05	The Bells	  Probably by quite a lot.
s08e05	The Bells	  How did they find you?  Did you consider taking it off?  Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister.
s08e05	The Bells	"  And you're going back to her, to die with her.
s08e05	The Bells	  You've underestimated her before.
s08e05	The Bells	  She's going to die.
s08e05	The Bells	  Unless you can convince her  to change her course of action.
s08e05	The Bells	  Difficult to do from here.
s08e05	The Bells	  [EXHALES HEAVILY.]
s08e05	The Bells	  When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?  Try.
s08e05	The Bells	  If not for yourself, if not for her,  then for every one of the million people in that city,  innocent or otherwise.
s08e05	The Bells	  To be honest, I never really cared much for them.
s08e05	The Bells	  Innocent or otherwise.
s08e05	The Bells	  You do care for one innocent.
s08e05	The Bells	  I know you do.
s08e05	The Bells	  And so does Cersei.
s08e05	The Bells	  She has a reason now.
s08e05	The Bells	  The child is the reason she'll never give an inch.
s08e05	The Bells	  All the worst things she's ever done,  she's done for her children.
s08e05	The Bells	  It's not impossible that she'll win.
s08e05	The Bells	  She won't.
s08e05	The Bells	  Her enemy's forces have been depleted,  as she said they would be.
s08e05	The Bells	  Two of the three dragons are dead.
s08e05	The Bells	  - She's evened the odds.
s08e05	The Bells	 - The city will fall tomorrow.
s08e05	The Bells	  She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company--  I defended the city last time it was attacked.
s08e05	The Bells	  I know it better than anyone.
s08e05	The Bells	 It will fall tomorrow.
s08e05	The Bells	  Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.
s08e05	The Bells	  Why?  Escape.
s08e05	The Bells	  The two of you, together.
s08e05	The Bells	  Remember where we met,  where they keep the dragon skulls,  beneath the Red Keep?  Take her down there.
s08e05	The Bells	  Keep following the stairways down,  down as far as they'll go.
s08e05	The Bells	  You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep.
s08e05	The Bells	  A dinghy will be waiting for you.
s08e05	The Bells	  Sail out of the bay.
s08e05	The Bells	  If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos.
s08e05	The Bells	  Start a new life.
s08e05	The Bells	  Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life?  Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war--  There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer.
s08e05	The Bells	  Do it.
s08e05	The Bells	  If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.
s08e05	The Bells	  Swear to me.
s08e05	The Bells	  You have my word.
s08e05	The Bells	  If it works,  give the order to ring all the bells  in King's Landing and open the gates.
s08e05	The Bells	  That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.
s08e05	The Bells	  I'll try.
s08e05	The Bells	  I never thought I'd get to repay the favor.
s08e05	The Bells	  Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.
s08e05	The Bells	  Your queen will execute you for this.
s08e05	The Bells	  If Daenerys can make it to the throne  without wading through a river of blood,  maybe she'll show mercy  to the person who made that possible.
s08e05	The Bells	  Tens of thousands of innocent lives  one not particularly innocent dwarf  it seems like a fair trade.
s08e05	The Bells	  If it weren't for you,  I never would've survived my childhood.

s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [DROGON ROARS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You freed your brother.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You committed treason.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I freed my brother.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And you slaughtered a city.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [IN VALYRIAN.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  What are you doing here?  Hey, what happened?  I came to kill Cersei.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Your queen got there first.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SIGHS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  JON: She's everyone's queen now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Try telling Sansa.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Wait for me outside the city gates.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - I'll come find you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - Jon.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She knows who you are.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Who you really are.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You'll always be a threat to her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And I know a killer when I see one.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [DOOR CLOSES.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Did you bring any wine?  No.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Ah  Well  thank you for coming to see me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I suppose there's a crude kind of justice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:  "See, I told you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	"  It just occurred to me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I'm talking to the only man alive  who knows where I'm going.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SIGHS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  So is there life after death?  Not that I've seen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I should be thankful.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Oblivion is the best I could hope for.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I strangled my lover.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I shot my own father with a crossbow.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I betrayed my queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - You didn't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - I did.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And I'd do it again,  now that I've seen what I've seen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I chose my fate.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The people of King's Landing did not.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I can't justify what happened.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I won't try.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - But the war is over now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - Is it?  When you heard her talking to her soldiers,  did she sound like someone who's done fighting?  She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She liberated the people of King's Landing.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And she'll go on liberating  until the people of the world are free  and she rules them all.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And you've been by her side, counseling her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Until today.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SOFTLY.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 Until today.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Varys was right.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I was wrong.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  It was vanity to think I could guide her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You think our house words are stamped on our bodies  when we're born and that's who we are?  Then I'd be fire and blood too.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She's not her father,  no more than you're Tywin Lannister.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  My father was an evil man.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 My sister was an evil woman.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Pile up all the bodies  of all the people they ever killed,  there still won't be half as many  as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Cersei left her no choice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The moment the gates fell,  the battle was over.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She saw her friend beheaded.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And she burned down a city for it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing  far from the battlefield.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Would you have done it?  What?  You've been up there, on a dragon's back.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You've had that power.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Would you have burned the city down?  - I don't know.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - [SCOFFS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Yes, you do.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You won't say because you don't want to betray her  but you know.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  What's it matter what I'd do?  It matters more than anything.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  When she murdered the slavers of Astapor,  I'm sure no one but the slavers complained.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  After all, they were evil men.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SIGHS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles,  who could argue?  They were evil men.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The Dothraki khals she burned alive?  They would have done worse to her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Everywhere she goes, evil men die  and we cheer her for it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And she grows more powerful  and more sure that she is good and right.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She believes her destiny  is to build a better world for everyone.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  If you believed that  if you truly believed it,  wouldn't you kill  whoever stood between you and paradise?  [JON INHALES DEEPLY.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I know you love her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I love her too.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Not as successfully as you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  But I believed in her with all my heart.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Love is more powerful than reason.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SNIFFLES.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We all know that.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Look at my brother.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  "Love is the death of duty.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	"  [SNIFFLES.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You just came up with that?  Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Sometimes duty is the death of love.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SNIFFLES.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You are the shield that guards the realms of men.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And you've always tried to do the right thing.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  No matter the cost,  you've tried to protect people.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Who is the greatest threat to the people now?  It's a terrible thing I'm asking.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  It's also the right thing.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute?  Who is more dangerous  than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?  [EXHALES SHAKILY.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  That's her decision.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 She is the queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I'm sorry it came to this.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [KNOCKS ON DOOR.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And your sisters?  Do you see them bending the knee?  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you?  Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - She doesn't get to choose.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - No.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  But you do.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [KEY RATTLING.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And you have to choose now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [GROWLS SOFTLY.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [WOMAN VOCALIZING.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made  with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  What do 1000 swords look like  in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20?  I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  So many fallen enemies,  you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  JON: I saw them executing  Lannister prisoners in the street.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  They said they were acting on your orders.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - It was necessary.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - Necessary?  Have you been down there?  Have you seen?  Children, little children, burned!  I tried to make peace with Cersei.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She used their innocence as a weapon against me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She thought it would cripple me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And Tyrion?  He conspired behind my back with my enemies.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  How have you treated people who've done the same to you,  even when it broke your heart?  Forgive him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - I can't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - You can.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You can forgive all of them,  make them see they made a mistake.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Make them understand.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Please, Dany.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We can't hide behind small mercies.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The world we need  won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The world we need is a world of mercy.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 It has to be.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And it will be.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  It's not easy to see something that's never been before.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  A good world.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  How do you know?  How do you know it'll be good?  Because I know what is good.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And so do you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - I don't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - You do.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You do.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 You've always known.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  What about everyone else?  All the other people who think they know what's good.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  They don't get to choose.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Be with me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Build the new world with me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  This is our reason.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  It has been from the beginning,  since you were a little boy with a bastard's name  and I was a little girl who couldn't count to 20.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We do it together.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SOFTLY.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 We break the wheel together.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You are my queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Now, and always.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [GRUNTS.]

s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Where's Jon?  - He is our prisoner.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - SANSA: So is Lord Tyrion.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  They were both to be brought to this gathering.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We will decide what we do with our prisoners.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  This is our city now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  If you look outside the walls of your city,  you'll find thousands of Northmen  who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow  is not in your interest.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And you will find thousands of Unsullied  who believe that it is.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Some of you may be quick to forgive.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The Ironborn are not.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You swore to follow a tyrant.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  She freed us from a tyrant.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Cersei is gone because of her,  and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Say another word about killing my brother  and I'll cut your throat.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Friends, please.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We've been cutting each other's throats long enough.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Torgo Nudho.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 Am I saying that properly?  If it weren't for you and your men,  we would've lost the war with the dead.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  This country owes you a debt it can never repay,  but let us try.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  There is land in the Reach.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Good land.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The people that used to live there are gone.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Make it your own.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 Start your own house  with the Unsullied as your bannermen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We've had enough war.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Thousands of you, thousands of them.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You know how it ends.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We need to find a better way.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We do not need payment.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We need justice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Jon Snow cannot go free.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  It's not for you to decide.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You are not here to speak!  Everyone has heard enough words from you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You're right.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And no one's any better for it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  But it's not for you to decide.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Jon committed his crime here.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  His fate is for our king to decide.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Or our queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  We don't have a king or queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You're the most powerful people in Westeros.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Choose one.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Make your choice, then.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  My lords and ladies  [CLEARS THROAT.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  What we decide today will reverberate  through the annals of history.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I stand before you  as one of the senior lords in the country.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  A veteran of two wars.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And I like to think my experience  has led to some small skill in statecraft  - and underst-- - SANSA: Uncle?  Please sit.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SCOFFS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [STUMBLES.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SIGHS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Well, we have to choose someone.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Um, ahem  Why just us?  Um--  We represent all the great houses,  but whomever we choose,  they won't just rule over lords and ladies.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone  should be left to  well, everyone.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [ALL LAUGHING.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I'll ask my horse.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I suppose you want the crown.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Me?  The Imp?  Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys,  the other half hate me for betraying her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - Can't think of a worse choice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - Who, then?  I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  About our bloody history.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  About the mistakes we've made.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  What unites people?  Armies?  Gold?  Flags?  Stories.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  There's nothing in the world more powerful  than a good story.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Nothing can stop it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  No enemy can defeat it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And who has a better story  than Bran the Broken?  The boy who fell from a high tower and lived.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  He crossed beyond the Wall,  a crippled boy,  and became the Three-Eyed Raven.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  He is our memory,  the keeper of all our stories.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Our triumphs,  mm, our defeats,  our past.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Who better to lead us into the future?  Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Good.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid,  as you well know.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  His will never torment us.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  From now on, rulers will not be born.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  They will be chosen on this spot  by the lords and ladies of Westeros  to serve the realm.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I know you don't want it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I know you don't care about power.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  But I ask you now, if we choose you  will you wear the crown?  Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities  from this day until your last day?  Why do you think I came all this way?  To Brandon of House Stark  I say aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  SAMWELL: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  MAN 1: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  MAN 2: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  YARA: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  MAN 3: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 MAN 4: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I love you, little brother.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 I always will.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You'll be a good king.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  But tens of thousands of Northmen  fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  And those who survived have seen too much  and fought too hard ever to kneel again.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The North will remain an independent kingdom,  as it was for thousands of years.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  All hail Bran the Broken,  First of His Name,  King of the Andals and the First Men,  Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  ALL: All hail Bran the Broken!  [.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  BRAN: Lord Tyrion  you will be my Hand.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  N--  No, Your Grace, I don't want it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  BRAN: And I don't want to be king.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I don't deserve it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Choose Ser Davos.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Choose anyone else.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - I choose you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - You cannot.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Yes, I can.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - I'm king.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - This man is a criminal.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  - He deserves justice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	 - He just got it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  He's made many terrible mistakes.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  It is not enough.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  TYRION: Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Letting you walk free would start a war.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  So our new king has chosen  to send you to the Night's Watch.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  There's still a Night's Watch?  The world will always need a home  for bastards and broken men.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  [SIGHS.]
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  You shall take no wife,  hold no lands,  father no children.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  The Unsullied wanted your head of course,  but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,  but they understand our new king needs to make peace.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  No one is very happy.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Which means it's a good compromise,  I suppose.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Was it right?  What I did?  What we did.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  It doesn't feel right.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  Ask me again in 10 years.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	  I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  When they started on Season 1, it was just one forest,  and 'cause this is the final season,  then yeah, everything seems to be a lot bigger  and heavier and more snow.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's just, uh, paper.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Paper and water,  and it does the job.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  You probably need to go into that, uh, hay doober, Steve.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's just trying to work out where we need to put stuff  and where we don't, you know?  You can go on and reckon we're just seeing that,  but, you know, you move the camera just an inch  and it's another 10 meters that you have to dress.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You can't just throw money at things, you know?  I'm a stickler for that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I don't like to give away too much money.

s08e90	The Last Watch	 You cannot sit there  having a fag, otherwise the whole thing's gonna go up.

s08e90	The Last Watch	 Thanks.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  STRAPAZON: He breaks down his scripts, which I help him do.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  He gets floor plans printed out that he cuts up  and then blocks out where the characters are gonna go,  where they move to, where the camera's gonna go.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And it's a little road map for the whole scene.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  He draws it all by hand,  and he likes it on U.

s08e90	The Last Watch	 Don't question the system.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This is my nemesis, this copy machine.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SIGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's upside down.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  STRAPAZON: He is one of the few people  on the show that has printed scripts.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  They were trying to go all digital this year,  have everything on iPads,  but that's just not how he rolls.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  He claims he's a Luddite, but, you know, he's done  some of the most iconic episodes.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  He did the Red Wedding and the Walk of Shame.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: What is that a drawing of, on the top there?  NUTTER: That's a dead Theon, and that's Sansa overtop of him.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  No.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Also this is very lucky, to see this bit.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  I would hope that I would be a Targaryen,  minus the whole are they crazy, are they not crazy,  the incest thing and all that stuff.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But, um, being able to go from,  you know, waiting and watching it on my couch  to then being on the set when they're shooting  the final season, it's been kind of surreal.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: Do we need to let you go do your job?  STRAPAZON: It would be good.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I'm going to bring him almonds,  which will be very good.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  SARAH: And David and Dan are coming.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: Dave and Dan are here,  so they will, most likely, be popping in, I imagine.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: So did you just set up and pitch to Game of Thrones?  - Did they come and offer you? - No.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SARAH: No, what happened was Barrie's always worked  for other prosthetic artists.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  And do you remember David Nutter said  they'd make sure that the character  would have their sleeves rolled up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So the issue is  Leigh says the characters are wearing long-sleeved,  thick jackets, which means  that really you can't do a severed arm gag  'cause it'll look stupid.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know, that's the gag, you're like  [SCREAMING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Can you scratch my nose?  SARAH: All we've got to do is try on the jacket  make sure I can pull the sleeve up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  If I can pull the sleeve up, its happy days,  - if I can't, we'll rethink.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Not happy days.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Then have a rethink.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  They'll say it's more important to go for the crypt.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  If you cut through there and there,  it's never going to go through A sword would never.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It would never.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Oh, that might be all right.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: It seems horribly convenient  he's got his sleeves rolled up  ready to have his arm chopped off.
s08e90	The Last Watch	    SARAH: I feel like he could have a few gold chains or something.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  If they're all having their pints  Hey!  Aah! Ha-ha-ha.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Thank you for doing that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Do you know how I get to Cell 4?  MAN: Oh, um  SARAH: Down there?  MAN: Right through there, take a left.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - It's right outside.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SARAH: Okay, thank you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Don't follow me getting lost.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SOFTLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Shit.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Damn it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Cell 2.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's hard when you work so hard on something  and you want everyone to like it,  so I'm hoping they'll be like, "Yeah, you nailed it!  High-five!"  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Has anyone said anything?  - BARRIE: Nobody's seen anything.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - SARAH: Nobody's seen anything.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - BARRIE: No.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - SARAH: I'm excited for these.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  BARRIE [WHISPERS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	: I think Dave and Dan are about to come.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN 1: Yeah, come on ahead, come on ahead.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SARAH: I can't really tell what they think.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I wanted a big round of applause.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I can't really tell what they think.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN 2:   SARAH: In terms of the makeup, I think they're happy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But, um, they're gonna send the pictures to Miguel,  Miguel's gonna make notes, go through them with David and Dan.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We're going to have a meeting tomorrow  to run through all library and crypt, so, you know.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But it wasn't a disaster.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Today's final.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Ha, ha.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Ta-da!    [MACHINERY BEEPING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  REID: Just little squirts every now and again  for bits that needs to go over.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SAPOCHNIK: The way this battle is gonna work  is this show has been about  that people don't get on.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Now they finally find a way to get on.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You got the North with the wildlings.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So they all come together and then somebody fucks up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  REID: Fucking gloves have shrunk.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You, Jack and Glen go in and see sweet cheeks  and do the dressing in there, ready for the first shot.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  REID: I think it's mainly that bit back there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yeah, that's the bit I can see.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's definitely tire tracks and that, car tracks.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I think that'll do it, then, I don't think  they'll see much further than that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SAPOCHNIK [ON MEGAPHONE.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	: All you guys  that made it, you're going to survive to the big battle.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Except the 10 guys in the back are gonna die.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [ALL CHUCKLE.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SAPOCHNIK: We're going to do a lot of running tonight.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  REID: Just a bit of blue roll, please.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SAPOCHNIK SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Just a little bit.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 One sheet, one sheet.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Don't waste it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SAPOCHNIK: Nine, eight, seven, six,  five, four, three, two, one, action.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Go have a look at the lasagna, see what it looks like.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  If it looks a bit skanky, I'll have the chicken.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Or maybe just have both  and take some home for fucking dinner.
s08e90	The Last Watch	    [MACHINERY BEEPING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SAPOCHNIK: I think one of the things to take into this  Let's do the whole scene as if you both got stomachache.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - TURNER: Okay.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - WILLIAMS: Mm-hm.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  TURNER: Okay.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Because also,  is this the first time you've seen a wight, as well?  This is the first time  - I'm seeing them.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We've been prepping and prepping  but really we don't know shit.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I think the whole point, though,  of this is it's not about You can't see them.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - It's the suspense of it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I think so.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That's what it is.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 That's what I'm saying, the stomachache,  it's uncomfortable because you can't see.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You don't have the information.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - SAPOCHNIK: Let's do it again  up to that point.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Then we'll work through the next section.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Set, and action.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And the dragons pass over you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And off they go.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And they bank left,  they get further and further away.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That light's slowly disappearing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And now there are none.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But what you can hear  is a very, very low rumble.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [RUMBLING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SAPOCHNIK: Episode 3 is a battle from start to finish  and has three dialogue scenes in it, and that's it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Like, if you took Battle of the Bastards into Hardhome  to the Loot Train, if you put all those three together  that's probably the size of this episode.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I feel tired and cold,  really not particularly in the mood  to go and do a long 11 weeks of night shoots.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I don't really want to spend 55 nights up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Uh, it's David and Dan's fault, mainly.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Basically.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  'Cause they wanted to do something bigger.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: Was today a good day?  Yeah, I think so.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Probably.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I mean, we finished it on time and didn't fuck it up.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  FURDIK:                     Now I'm in the front line,  so I'm like, "Wow, what I'm doing here?"  Why? Why me?  [SONG PLAYING OVER RADIO.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SINGING ALONG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FURDIK: I grow up in Czechoslovakia.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  After the revolution, many of my friends  became part of the bad boy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I was 14, 15, and I had decision.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Go with them to be gangster,  or be with a live show.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So when I decided to stay with the show,  it was good because many of my friends are dead already.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  And I don't heard Night King, I heard just king.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And I said, "I can be any king.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  You know.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Don't worry.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I think he's angry.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  He don't want to be Night King.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  The Children of the Forest, they changed him,  and now he's, "Okay, you want me to be Night King?  Okay.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Now I kill you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  My name is Aberdale Strongbeard.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Uh, I have fought for Stannis Baratheon.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I've also fought for, uh, Jon Snow,  and that's where I currently find myself,  as part of Jon Snow's Stark army.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I've been taking out the undead,  you know, thinning them out  before they actually reach Winterfell.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: I don't want to be on the Night Watch,  I'm in House Stark, thank you very much.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm not a thief, I'm not a rapist, okay?  It's just Watch now.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm not even a second son of a lord  who wants honor up on the Wall.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm a man of House Stark, that's what I am.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I don't want to be a Frey.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 No way Frey.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I don't want to be a Lannister.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  The armor's cool.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Winterfell's class.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's just, like, the main family in the story.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I was standing up at Magheramorne Quarry Season 6,  and I had just met Gerald.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And then we're just chatting,  and then the next thing here comes Kit Harington  on a horse and Kit Harington's like, "Oh, hello, Gerald.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  Just like that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And they just start talking like they're friends.

s08e90	The Last Watch	 You okay?  CAULFIELD: When I first came onboard, Chris sent me a picture  of Iceland.

s08e90	The Last Watch	 - RILEY: By a long way.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  The schedule is impossible.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 And  The season is very big.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's written very big, um, but we have  It's just all this business of trying to do,  you know, film finishes on a TV schedule,  and on a TV deadline.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 And, um  And I think this season,  we've certainly found the limit  of what's able to be achieved.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And, um  And insofar as I think, now everybody, um, realizes  that Game of Thrones has to finish  because it just cannot get any bigger.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know, there are a lot of frayed nerves walking around,  um, myself being one of them.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  LISTON: We're still totally, 100 percent  frozen over at Tomb.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  No, I mean, yesterday we had 250 extras,  and all the crew and not one toilet.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  In the bowls, the bleach was frozen.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN [ON WALKIE.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	: That's wild.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Oh, it was the icicles  hanging off the taps that I couldn't believe.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You try and preempt as much as you can,  but sometimes it just gets to a stage where,  you know, you just can't hold mother nature back anymore.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  REID: I mean, it's starting to snow again now so,  you know, it's one of them, "I can't really say  "that we're gonna do work  until I know we can do some work.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  Is that a good enough answer for you?  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I can't really say anything else,  'cause it's snowing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 And if it snows,  well, we can't just dress on top of real snow.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Cheers.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Thanks a lot.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Bye.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Bye.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It was not a good idea to have been doing it in the winter.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You needed to have spread the snow locations out,  because we can't do that many at one time.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Look at all this nonsense,  it just keeps coming through all the time.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's like, okay, like I've got time  to keep pulling my phone out of my pocket.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Zigzag road, they made us put up a horizon the night before,  came in in the morning ready to shoot  "Can you take that down?"  So that's half a day of mine wasted.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So, what we're doing, we're getting this snow up,  so we can take it up to Magheramorne,  the battlefield.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 You know, we're just under the cost.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Ah, shit.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  The wind's blowing a good one here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  REID: You, Dicky, you up at Magheramorne?  There is no water at all.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Nightmare.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 All right, mate.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Tara, tara.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's all frozen up at Magheramorne.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Now I have to sort out a pump and pump it out the lake  and, ugh! Fucking hell.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: How's it going, Del?  REID: It is all going.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I just feel like crying.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This car's got no bollocks.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This Fiesta, stupid little thing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [IMITATES ENGINE.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know, it's difficult to find people  who know the job, and it's not rocket science.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I mean, you could do it, Jeanie.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 It ain't hard.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [HONKS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Welcome to hell, George.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Welcome to hell.
s08e90	The Last Watch	    I'm not one for listening to people whinge.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I just think, "Oh, come on.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  I was brought up in children's homes.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know, I didn't have a clue where me mom and dad was.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I left the homes when I was 16-and-a-half.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  They give you 300 quid, your bloody birth certificate,  and all right, get yourself out there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 It's just, "Hm.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Okay, then.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  So, yeah, that opened my eyes.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  As I've progressed, you know, I've always got more money  and I just think, "To keep that,  I'll have to keep working at the pace I'm working.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  You just want to do the best for your kids.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know, I'd give up my house for my kids.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  REID [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	: I've never not done a set yet,  but it's been very close twice.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This is the second time it's been close.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But we'll get there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I think.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  WOMAN 1: Hi.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 My horses are dyed pink.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  WOMAN 2:   WOMAN 1: Don't even go there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  They've tried warm water, Fairy liquid,  - I can't get them back to white.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Look at the state of him.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  One of them might be saying, "I'm pink.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I don't like pink.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  McCLAY: Magheramorne Quarry's been the site  of the Battle of the Blackwater,  Hardhome, it's also Castle Black.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This is the biggest green screen I have ever seen,  but it's really impressive what they've built here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [HORSE NEIGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: This battle sequence I think we have coming up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  They don't tend to tell us a lot of stuff.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  On the day, one of the ADs get up  and actually tells us what's actually happening that day.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - The numbers we've just heard  are 120,000 wights  [LAUGHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 against 18,000  um, combined in Daenerys's army  and Jon Snow's army as well, like.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So we're extremely outnumbered.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I can't even begin to imagine how this is gonna look on TV.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: The way I like to think of it  is that the extras department is like one of the main actors.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Just as important.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I got a close-up at the Battle of the Bastards,  I had no idea the camera was on me.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  ASSISTANT: Rolling.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Camera set, and three, two, one  [ALL GRUNTING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: There's this collective thing  we know that we're all in,  trying to make this really exciting.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Because even the background tells a big story.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  ASSISTANT: Great stuff, thank you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 We have cut.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  We started in January.
s08e90	The Last Watch	    FINLAY: Is this the longest run of nights on Game of Thrones?  Yes.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 In fact, we were trying to think  is this the longest time any film has filmed nights?  I guess I could try to Google that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  What's the longest nights of any film crew?  SAPOCHNIK: A smoke nightmare.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That's like smoke apocalypse.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's almost like a bad dream.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  Three hours? Is that four hours? I don't know.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  One of my best-ever anxiety dreams.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It was a beautiful blue sky,  and there was a rope strung across my vision  and it just got pulled taut, taut, taut, taut.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Then it snapped, and I woke up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN:   SAPOCHNIK: I don't fucking know.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Sounds like anxiety to me.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's gonna be amazing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 If anybody dies, let me know.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  CAULFIELD: I can feel the weariness setting in.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Tonight Candy said, "Oh, only 14 weeks until we wrap.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  And that made it sound like, "What? No.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  I mean, it's a mixed thing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  One way, you're wishing it away,  like, "Oh, please, let's get through this, this and this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  And then the other one is like, "No,  I don't want this to end.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  FURDIK: Many times the stunts are joking with me:  "Hey, you're the Night King, you don't need to do nothing.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  There we are, Jeanie, that's it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I don't think it's worth doing the machine,  we may as well just run it out of the bags.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  In Season 7, Jaime was in King's Landing  and a snowflake landed on his hand, didn't it?  So that allows you then to put little bits wherever.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There isn't going to be much snow apparently,  so it's just me.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Not too much, just to say that it's blown in  and stayed.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yep, that does it for me.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: It's award-winning snow, Del.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Does that mean anything? - REID: Yeah, it's great.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  They brought the Emmys to set so everybody could have  their photograph taken with them.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's the first time I've ever had  my photograph taken with the Emmy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Not that I'd show anything, "This is my Emmy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  I've got a certificate, we got the original  We had to pay for it, but, you know,  I don't mind paying for it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 You know, so, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I was part of the Emmy award-winning  So, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 But you don't show that, do you?  It's like having a forklift license.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  CAULFIELD: It's very hard to keep the cast quiet,  because when in Spain, you must eat and drink.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  They're going to be out and about,  and so we brought in a few ringers.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We have The Waif coming in, because so many people think  that Arya is dead and The Waif killed her.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We have Jaqen, who's also another  House of Black and White character.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And we have the Night King here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Not quite sure what he would be saying.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So they won't know what's happening.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It'll be a big surprise no matter what.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Jon Snow is here!  GREY WORM: You are not here to speak.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I've had nothing to do but think  these past few weeks  about our bloody history.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And who has a better story  than Bran the Broken?  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  HARINGTON: It's weird, I've come out basically as decoy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It feels weird being here and not actually filming.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  When all the Spanish fans shout Kit,  they shout, "Keet! Keet!"  So the rest of the cast have now dubbed me Keet.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: Keet!  HARINGTON: Keet! Keet!  WOMAN: Please, please, please, please.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Hi.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [FANS CLAMORING.]

s08e90	The Last Watch	 Sophie!  Okay.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I never saw this in all of my life.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So it's like, uh like, uh  [FANS SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Like a real star, how can you live in this life, you know?  Everybody recognizes them, so.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [FANS CHEERING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Okay, we can come there  and just give them a couple sign, yeah?  Okay, come on.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I would like to see if they recognize who I am, you know?  [BOTH LAUGH.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SHUSHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Please.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know who I am?  CROWD: Yeah! Night King.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Ah! Yes! - FAN 1: The Night King!  [CROWD CHEERING AND CLAPPING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Where is my? - FAN 2: Winter is coming!  Where is my army? Yes.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FAN 3: I hope you win the war.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FAN 4: You are the best, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Hey, my friends, look at this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Look at this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 My Lord.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Say something! - What?  - Say hi.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Hey!  Game of Thr  [BOTH LAUGHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Winter is coming! - Winter is coming!  Yes! Yes!  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [FANS CHEERING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN [ON PA.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	: That was Vlad the Night King's last-ever shot  on Game of Thrones.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [ALL CHEERING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	    [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	    RILEY: The best moment for us  is actually just before the cameras arrive.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  When we have it to ourselves for a minute.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  When it's quiet, and you can feel the set  has a personality of its own,  and it's all dressed and ready to go.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That's when I love it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There's some mighty doors.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Twenty-nine weeks, four days.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  RILEY: Twenty-nine weeks, four days.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Not that you're counting.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Twenty-nine weeks.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  RILEY: Not bad for seven months' work.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You built a city in seven months.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I honestly can say I could not have worked harder.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I really have given this everything I have.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And I love it when you see people go up  and they do this, you know?  The minute that the camera arrives,  and the machines and lights and hundreds of people come in,  they use it as they need to.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We're quite shy people,  we just want to be able to do our work and leave.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I don't think the actors would even know who I am.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That suits me just fine.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Well, I'm the carpet man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Apparently, there's some looters coming.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  My scene is to frantically bring the carpets in  as quickly as I can and close the shutters.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I've got the lovely maiden across the way,  I'm trying to get her attention.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  She's otherwise occupied.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm just having a little contemplative moment,  enjoying the sunshine.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And then, yeah, all panic sets in.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But I'm a bit precious about my pots,  you might have noticed.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I want to get them all off the balcony.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  ASSISTANT [ON PA.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	: Hello, can everyone hear me?  You have to imagine right here today  that this is like alarms going off.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There are air raid sirens.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You guys are trying to get into the Red Keep,  which is over there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Welcome to King's Landing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Let's go.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  That's mark.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  CAULFIELD: There's one, two, three  [SUCKS AIR.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Oh, my God, Monday is four weeks away  from the end of principal photography.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Oh, my God.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLAY: How are your days looking?  - Are they easing? - No.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  No, we're actually in  probably almost I wouldn't say the toughest time,  but not the way we all thought we would have our  spend our golden days at Game of Thrones.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  What the fuck was I thinking?  Which is what I'm gonna put on my tombstone.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Morning, morning.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Listen up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 So as you all know,  Sam and his team have been rigging an explosion,  and when we have shade, we will blow this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - CAULFIELD: So we can stay here, right? -   -  -         MAN: Can you look after Building 1, yeah?  You know Building 1, outside the front? Yeah?  That's it then, guys.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  [EXPLOSIONS BOOMING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  CAULFIELD: Holy shit.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCRUM: We haven't had a chance to look at it yet,  so we've only seen the building site so far.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's the only place you can't wait to get over  to watch all the men get burnt.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There you go, cheers.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Thank you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Okay, what can I get you?  We've only got the wee ice lollies,  on the board you'll see.
s08e90	The Last Watch	    You can't beat a Pear Picking Porky.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Completely cleaned out of the ice pops twice today.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I never thought I was gonna see this much heat,  - feel this much heat.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Complain about it so much.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And complain about it so much, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We like the cold.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 We prefer the cold than the heat.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Thank you so much.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Free wave.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That's brilliant, you can turn them 'round  and somebody's up there spinning it manically.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There's going to be projectile vomit everywhere.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I mean, you couldn't write it, could you?  Let's put a big, massive Ferris wheel,  and actually not tell anybody  that we're putting a Ferris wheel there,  you know, amongst all the discussions  about the big weekend and our set over there and filming.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Oh, no, they built the fucking London Eye.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [PEOPLE CLAMORING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SCREAMING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  WOMAN: Cut there.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Reset.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: Oh, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Do you know what club sandwich means?  Do you know what club sandwich means?  Chicken and lettuce under bacon, that's what that is.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - I didn't know that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - It's an acronym?  Yeah, chicken and lettuce under bacon.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Learn something new every day.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Boom.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Every day's a school day.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  WOMAN: Rolling!  MAN: We're rolling.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Quiet, everyone.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [WOMAN SCREAMING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [YELLING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [WHISTLE BLOWS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Have we got a fake head hanging around?  Yep.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Any severed head will do.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Chow, why in the fuck are you wearing that Bolton jacket here?  Let me see this?  That's shite.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Get out of here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 How are you, man? You all right?  CHOW: I'm shaking your hand.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Fucking Boltons, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Aye, you didn't think.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You didn't fucking think about wearing that jacket, did you?  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY:   ASSISTANT: We're rolling.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: As soon as they shout rolling, I'm preparing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And action, I'm in Westeros.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  ASSISTANT: Action!  [ULULATING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: You know, you can only push a man so far, I think.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You can only push his House so far.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It doesn't matter how good he is, you know?  If their blood gets up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 It's war.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This is vengeance for the Red Wedding,  for the Starks, for seven seasons  of taking shit from House Lannister.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So we're landing down in force,  and we're just gonna kill everybody inside the city.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Unfortunately.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 For them.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SCREAMING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  NUTTER: For the funeral scene, it's all about  blocking where everybody stands.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I work hard about preparation,  because I don't like to waste people's time.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And I want to spend more time directing actors.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  FINLEY: Are you this prepared in all areas of your life?  No.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  No, I'm not.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  If you saw my apartment this morning,  you'd see that, uh,  that didn't get any preparation at all.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I have to have two cleaning ladies come twice a week.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's, ah It's so awful.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 It's such a mess.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I want the journey to be just as positive as the end product.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That's important.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Because what you remember is the journey.
s08e90	The Last Watch	    All the pyres and get people in the foreground for us.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We'll basically do the eulogy, the speech,  then all coming up to light the pyres,  they look at each other,  then drop down, light the pyre, cut.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We're going to match the last frame of this  to the first frame of that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Fill the frame  and send it to me and David before you go.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yeah, good.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Good morning, brother.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - How are you? - NUTTER: Good, brother.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - So you're just, you're dead.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - I'm dead.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I'm dead.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  NUTTER: Everyone wants a pied piper.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Not to say that I'm the pied piper,  but I definitely can fake it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You create your own world behind the camera.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You'll take the pin out,  and you're reaching down here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 As you put it into his chest,  you look at his eyes, like, "You're a Stark now," right?  - Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Then you stand up.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [EXHALES.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Okay.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - And then you go.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - TURNER: Okay, cool.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So just give me like a couple minutes to get into it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - NUTTER: The way we just did it? - ASSISTANT: Could we get  everybody on their marks for the reference.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  NUTTER: Let's see here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Here you go, my brother.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 You're here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  A bunch of wildlings behind you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  If you guys can all meet him there  NUTTER: I get pretty tired, but I get invigorated too.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I guess sometimes it's a bit of performance anxiety,  where I want to do a good job  so that everyone feels that, "He knows what he's doing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  This is a dream job for a director.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  After directing Seasons 2, 3, and 5,  I had to step away for a couple seasons due to back issues.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And I had a couple surgeries.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So I missed it beyond belief.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And coming back now, I appreciate it so much that  This show saved my life.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We're now going to talk about why we're here.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Everyone here, you've all lost mothers, brothers,  and friends, and sisters, and wives, and everything.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So background, it's all about playing that attitude  all the way through.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Okay, ready? Here we go.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  My father died in a car accident  when I was a year-and-a-half old,  so my mother and I grew up together.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  She would listen to music, and I'd sing and perform  for her friends that would come over for dinner.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I wanted to be the next Barry Manilow.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  In college, I realized that wasn't gonna happen for me,  so I said to myself, "What else can I do?"  And realized that my desire to move people emotionally,  I could do it by being involved in filmmaking.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  NUTTER: Action.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Spirit move me Every time I'm near you   Whirling like a cyclone in my mind   Baby, I love you come   Come, come into my arms   Let me know the wonder of all of you   Could it be magic?   Oh, come on, come on come on   Come into my arms   Oh, let me know the wonder Of all of you, all of you   Baby, I want you now, now   Oh, now oh, now and hold on fast   Oh, could this be the magic at last?   Could it be magic now?   NUTTER: Now!  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]

s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: The atmosphere today when we done the big group photo,  that hit home.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I said goodbye to the Night's Watch.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I've known them for years.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: We all have extras jackets,  and I managed to give Kit Harington one today.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  He's now trying to give me money for it,  but I won't take the money,  because I just want to give  Jon Snow his jacket, big time.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So he'll never give me that money.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I don't want that money.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's going to be very emotional for the actors.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I couldn't imagine what it's like  for them to finally say goodbye.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [BANKS CHUCKLING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [EXCLAIMING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We're in no rush this morning.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  CLARKE: No, I know.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 You know what?  BANKS: It's Emilia's last day, we're in no rush.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Is there any part of you that's a bit relieved?  - Do you know what I mean? - BANKS: Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Uh, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Like, not in a:  "Oh, thank fuck that's over," but as in  like a, "Oh, right, that's one thing  I don't need to panic about anymore.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  BANKS: I'm tired.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Tired.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  BANKS: I kind of had enough just now.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Mm.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - [CHUCKLES.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - BANKS: It's that bittersweet - CLARKE: Yeah, exactly.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  BANKS: Because my life's been on pause,  let's unpause it and get that garden fence painted.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Exactly.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Yeah, for heaven's sake.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Put that picture on the wall, damn it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But yeah, there's definitely an exhale of breath.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So many people involved in this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know, it's just people's everything.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's kind of exciting to sort of think:  "Oh, who am I without this, then?"  I wonder.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Adjust.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm trying to remember the first time we put this on.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I saw a clip of that the other day,  when you were riding on that horse through Belfast,  and it was absolutely freezing.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And you were in, like, nothing but a slip.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  No such thing as thermals back then.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SIGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm not sure this wig's got much more life left in it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  CLARKE: Neither has the head underneath it, so  Oh, it's the last time.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  BANKS: It's the last time.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Oh, that's really weird.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [.]

s08e90	The Last Watch	  BANKS: This is my idea of hell, at the moment.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I hate goodbyes anyway, I'm not good at it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'll try to just sneak out the back door  and miss this bit out.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Hey now, hey now, now Sing "This Corrosion" to me   Hey now, hey now now sing   LISTON: Here's a bit of wood I could take home.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  That's where we stabbed Jon Snow.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  Well, old girl, cheerio.

s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's just fucking tele, isn't it?  Oh So this has been really quite hard.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 And, um, I think,  you know, some days we've really struggled to get through it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I think if it wasn't for you guys and your morale,  that's really what has got us through.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But this is obviously a big end.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I know lots of you are going home  as of the weekend, and I hope  that we get other projects like this again.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  BARRIE: I don't.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [ALL LAUGHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Because I want to keep the team together.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So thank you, everybody.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Thank you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [ALL CHEER AND CLAP.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: So it's me, you, Big Johnny.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Shane Cavanaugh's coming in too.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  All right.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I heard it's only 12 people doing it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yeah, there's only 10 Unsullied.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: You all right, man?  There's very few of us in for this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: I was just told I have a feature  there at the very last episode.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So Jon's honor guard, I was like, no way.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - So - FINLEY: Do you think  you'll get seen on camera?  Eh, because it's such a tight scene  with less numbers, possibly, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 So, um  It'll be like, yeah, just point to me,  "Dad, there I am.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Look again.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  And he'll be like, "Yep.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Again.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So it would be a brilliant way  to cap off the season.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  2016, 2015.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm trying to find Andy McClay's first day.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Ah, there he is.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This is the first makeup look.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I was like, you'll never get a part if you look like that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You'll have to change your expression.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And then we got Andy McClay.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Cold Andy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's as if it's Day 1.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You came in and you told me that your house had just burnt down.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Oh, yeah, the fire in the house.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I was like, and you're here for a makeup test?  Had a fire in the house.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You weren't late either.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  No, I wasn't late.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 This is the thing, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Escape from the reality.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [CHUCKLES.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Right.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Look there, now.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Argh.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - And shoot.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Sorted.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  SMYTH: Off you pop, off you pop.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Goodbye, Andy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: This is sinking in now, that it's my last day.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Just back to normal life now, after this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Good morning, how are you? Nice to see you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Kit, all right, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  HARINGTON:   Ah, nice one, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Nice one, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Do you want a Season 8 one?  A Targaryen dragon man with a direwolf head  in the middle of it, that's what we're getting for Season 8.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 -   Yeah? I can get you one of them if you want one.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yeah, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Some detail.
s08e90	The Last Watch	      - Yeah, yeah.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 -   Sweet, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - Nice, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - See ya.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Sweet, eh?    - I know, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I know.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - Last day.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Aw, what?  [LAUGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen,  I sentence you to die.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Grey Worm.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: Grey Worm, he's totally gone,  and of course Jon's trying to save lives,  so him and Grey Worm have a standoff there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I think that the Starks in the background  are in a very precarious situation,  because we hate Lannisters.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  We don't care if they die.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But it's our king's command.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 If the Unsullied are  pointing their spears at him we're not happy with that.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  DAVOS: Easy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Set.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Three, two, one, Action.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: Cut.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  ASSISTANT: Okay, cut there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [EXHALES.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So with that, that is a Game of Thrones wrap  on our good friend Jacob Anderson,  Liam Cunningham, and Kit Harington.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  CROWD: Keet! Keet!  WEISS: Ten years ago you walked in to Nina Gold's office,  as a 12-year-old  [ALL LAUGH.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And here we are now.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Your watch has ended.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And it has been a hell of a watch.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  For us, for these people,  and for so many people around the world.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Thank you for being Jon Snow,  and thank you more than that for being you.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [ALL CLAPPING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  HARINGTON: I feel like my heart is breaking.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I love this show.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [CRYING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  More than, I think, anything.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It has never been a job for me.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's been my life, and this will always be  the greatest thing I'll ever do and be a part of,  and you have been just my family.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I love you for it, and thank you so much.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [ALL CLAPPING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  ASSISTANT Reset, please.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN:       McCLAY [SIGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	: Thanks, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [CLEARS THROAT.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm choking up here, man.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Honestly.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Um  It's what Kit was saying.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Um  Even though I'm just an extra  in comparison to him being the main star,  um, it has  It really has changed my life.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SNIFFLES.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 The show  I didn't think I was going to get this emotional.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It has, it really has.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  The past five years has been the best five years  It's been the best five years of my life.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So, um, I will miss it.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  But it's always something that I'll be able to look back on.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [CLEARS THROAT.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 So absolutely brilliant.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  It's just It's hard to fathom  that I'll never be coming back to Game of Thrones.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  MAN: All background back to TEC.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Going this way.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  McCLAY: Best thing I've ever done.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There are four white walls In every damn hotel   A light by the bed Stains on the floor   And it's here I will wait out the storm   CAULFIELD: It's hard saying goodbye to everybody.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There's too many people that you just want to talk to  and say how much you love them and thank them,  and you just can't.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I think that I was able to,  I don't know, to bring my philosophy of,  you know, love and camaraderie and family to the show.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  You know, that's the way I just always treat everybody.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  CAULFIELD: If people have Game of Thrones on their credits,  people know that person had to work really hard,  that person knew what they were doing,  that person created, you know, a magical world.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  [SIGHS.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  There are red velvet seats   In the windowless rooms   A curtain to draw   And faces to please   And it's here I will wait out the storm   Killing time on the fringes again   Before the leaving   Before the leaving   McCLAY: Ladies and gentlemen,  welcome to Game of Thrones tours.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  What is dead may never die,  but rises again, harder and stronger.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  So guys, you're very welcome to Game of Thrones tours.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm gonna talk to you about this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  This is Carrick Castle.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Guys, Carrick Castle is not in Game of Thrones,  so we're just going to fucking drive on past Carrick Castle.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I'm going to take you to Stannis's camp,  what we're going to see  is all the lads laying low for their gruel,  then who's going to pop on?  It's Ser Davos Seaworth,  Hand of the King to Stannis Baratheon.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Easing himself onto camera,  that's me right there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  - [SHIVERING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 - [ALL LAUGHING.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Wasn't even cold that day on set.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Acting, is what we call this.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Yeah? All right.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Here we come, we're coming around the corner  and we're gonna see Irish mists.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  And we're coming up here now,  just around this bend.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  Castle Black, ladies and gentlemen.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  I guarantee that it's up there.
s08e90	The Last Watch	  If you could see it, well done to you.

s08e90	The Last Watch	 "Hey.
s08e90	The Last Watch	 Hey, buddy.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"  [NORMALLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 And I'm like, "Yeah, what's up, man?"  [IN AMERICAN ACCENT.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 He said, "How did the Troubles start?  Tell me, how did the Troubles start?"  [NORMALLY.]
s08e90	The Last Watch	 I was like, "Well, mate,  the Troubles first started when Jaime Lannister  pushed Bran Stark out the window.
s08e90	The Last Watch	"
