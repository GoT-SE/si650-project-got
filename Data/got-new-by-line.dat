s01e01	Winter is Coming	[First scene opens with three Rangers riding through a tunnel, leaving the Wall, and going into the woods. (Eerie music in background) One Ranger splits off and finds a campsite full of mutilated bodies, including a child hanging from a tree branch. A birds-eye view shows the bodies arranged in a shield-like pattern. The Ranger rides back to the other two.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WAYMAR ROYCE: What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WILL: I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WILL: Close as any man would.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	GARED: We should head back to the wall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROYCE: Do the dead frighten you?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	GARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROYCE: You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[GARED grumbles.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROYCE: It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[WILL glares, but obeys. Sometime later, the three Rangers return to the campsite, which is now completely cleared.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WILL: They were here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	GARED: See where they went.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The three look around, swords drawn. They hear the wind and eerie calls. GARED finds a red cloth in the snow.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROYCE: What is it?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	GARED: It’s …
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[As he speaks, a CREATURE with glowing blue eyes rises behind ROYCE. ROYCE turns, the CREATURE strikes. The scene shifts to WILL, who hears a man crying out. The three horses stampede past him. He turns and sees someone standing very still in the distance. The figure turns – it’s the child who had been suspended in the tree, now with glowing blue eyes. WILL turns and runs.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	GARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GARED’S head to him.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Blackout]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Riders from Winterfell come up behind a dazed WILL. The scene shifts to the castle, where BRAN is practicing archery and getting frustrated, under the eyes of JON SNOW and ROBB STARK. JON pats BRAN’S shoulder.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Go on. Father’s watching.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[We see NED and CATELYN STARK watching from above.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: And your mother.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to needlework practice with the girls inside the castle.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SEPTA MORDANE (to SANSA): Fine work, as always. Well done.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Thank you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[As she murmurs to SANSA about the embroidery, ARYA struggles with her needlework and listens to the arrows hitting and the male laughter outside.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Outside, BRAN tries and misses again. Everyone laughs.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Don’t think too much, Bran.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: Relax your bow arm.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[BRAN pulls the arrow back. An arrow hits the bullseye. BRAN (still with his arrow), JON, and ROBB turn in surprise to see ARYA, who curtsies after her perfect shot. ROBB and JON laugh as Bran takes out after ARYA.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON/ROBB: Quick, Bran, faster!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[RODRICK CASSEL and THEON GREYJOY approach NED and CATELYN on the balcony.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[NED grimaces.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Get the lads to saddle their horses.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[THEON departs.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Do you have to?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: He swore an oath, Cat.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CASSEL: The law is law, my lady.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Tell Bran he’s coming, too.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[CASSEL nods and departs.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[NED departs. In the courtyard, ROBB and JON gather the arrows. CATELYN turns and glares down on JON. He looks at her and walks away.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts, and we see WILL being taken to the block.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WILL (muttering): White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He and NED face each other.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block. [NED draws Ice from a scabbard held by Theon.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	WILL (whispering): Forgive me, lord.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[NED bows his head over ICE.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON (to BRAN): Don’t look away.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: King of the Andals and the First Men …
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Father will know if you do.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[NED swings ICE and beheads WILL. BRAN does not look away.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: You did well.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN and they go to their horses together. NED approaches BRAN.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: You understand why I did it?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: Our way is the old way?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: So he was lying?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: A madman sees what he sees.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to a dead stag’s head. The Winterfell men gather on the bridge They see a ravaged deer before them.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: What is it?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THEON: Mountain lion?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[With swords out, they begin to search. NED finds a dead direwolf with antlers through her throat. Her pups are whimpering around her.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THEON: It’s a freak.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: It’s a direwolf.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[NED and CASSEL glance at each other.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Tough old beast.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He pulls out the antlers.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Now there are five.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Jon picks up a pup and offers it to BRAN.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: You want to hold it?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CASSEL: They don’t belong down here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THEON: Right. Give it here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: NO!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB (disgustedly to THEON): Put away your blade.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THEON: I take orders from your father, not you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: Please, father!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: I’m sorry, Bran.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Everyone looks at NED, BRAN with great hope.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[BRAN cradles his pup as JON hands more pups to ROBB.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN (to JON): What about you?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: I’m not a Stark. Get on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JON walks away, pauses, and hears another whimper.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: What is it?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JON pulls up a white wolf pup.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THEON: The runt of the litter. That one’s yours, Snow.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to bells ringing at Kings Landing. In front of the Iron Throne, surrounded by druidical looking celebrants, lies the body of JON ARRYN. Up in the balcony, CERSEI watches the scene below as JAIME approaches.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you: You worry too much. It’s starting to show.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: But who would he tell?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: My husband.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to a raven approaching Winterfell. CATELYN crosses a busy courtyard and finds NED in the godswood.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: I wonder if the old gods agree.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: It’s your gods with all the rules.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: I am so sorry, my love.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Tell me.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Your sister. The boy …
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: You can always say no, Ned.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to the Winterfell great hall where a great banquet is being prepared.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber. I’m told he reads all night.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	MAESTER LUWIN: I’m told he drinks all night.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	LUWIN: We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: In any case, candles.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to Robb, Theon, and Jon getting barbered.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THEON: It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s [sleek as a mink?]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to the royal procession approaching Winterfell. Bran sees them from his perch high atop a castle wall and clambers nimbly down to tell everyone. CATELYN and LUWIN walk to the courtyard, passing BRAN’s wolf pup.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: How many times have I told you: No climbing!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: But he’s coming right now! Down our road!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: I want you to promise me: No more climbing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN (looking down): I promise.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: D’you know what?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: What?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[BRAN runs off, followed by his wolf pup.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to grand entry of the king’s horses and men. ARYA, wearing a helm and cloak, pushes her way into a tall wagon for a better look. In rides JOFFREY, followed by the HOUND. The other Starks wait in a greeting line.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[More riders with banners. ARYA scoots past her parents to get in the receiving line.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA’s helm]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ARYA (pushing BRAN): Move!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JOFFREY rides up, SANSA smiles at him, ROBB glares at JOFFREY. The HOUND pulls up his helm. The coach carrying CERSEI lumbers in, followed by KING ROBERT. All kneel. ROBERT heaves himself off his horse. NED looks shocked at the sight of his old friend, now fat and red-faced. ROBERT signals for all to rise and looks at NED.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: You’ve got fat.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[NED gives ROBERT a “What about you?” look. They start laughing.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Cat!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[CERSEI and her other children descend from the coach.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Will you shut up?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ARYA: Arya.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT (to BRAN) Ooh. Show us your muscles. You’ll be a soldier.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JAIME removes his helm.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ARYA: That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Would you please shut up.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[CERSEI approaches.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: My queen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: My queen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Ned.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[CERSEI, humiliated in front of all, walks back to JAIME.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene changes to the crypt.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: We both did.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Aye.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[NED kneels.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: I’m not worthy of the honor.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene changes to JAIME in the Winterfell settlement. We see Tyrion inside a whorehouse, swilling liquor and laughing as a woman pops into view after servicing him.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROS: Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: I did hear something about that.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: And the other brother?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROS: The queen has two brothers?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROS: I hear they call him the Imp.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: I hear he hates that nickname.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROS: Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: Clever girl.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROS: We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: Have you?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: The gods gave me one blessing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[She climbs on TYRION. JAIME walks in without knocking.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: Don’t get up.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROS: M’lord.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: She has odd cravings, our sister.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JAIME leaves.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: Close the door!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb. [Robert places a feather in the hand of her statue.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: She belonged with me.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He touches Lyanna’s face.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: In my dreams, I kill him every night.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Not all of them.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to Daenerys on a balcony in Pentos, across the Narrow Sea.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS (off camera): Daenerys!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He enters a large chamber.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: No.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[VISERYS nods and starts to leave the chamber. He turns.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Daenerys turns and steps into a steaming hot bath with a despairing look on her face.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	MAID: It’s too hot, my lady.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[But DAENERYS keeps stepping deeper. The scene shifts to ILLYRIOS, DAENERYS, AND VISERYS outside the mansion, awaiting Khal Drogo.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: Where is he?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[A host of Dothraki come riding up. Khal Drogo wheels his stallion into the front.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS (to DAENERYS) Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: Come forward, my dear.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[KHAL DROGO watches as DAENERYS walks toward him. She does not hesitate and looks straight at him, although there is fear on her face. KHAL DROGO gazes at her and then leads his horsemen on a charge away.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: Where’s he going?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The scene shifts to ILLYRIO, VISERYS, AND DAENERYS ON A GARDEN BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SEA.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: When will they be married?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS (pleadingly) I don’t want to be his queen. I want to go home.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: I don’t know.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He gives DAENERYS a brotherly kiss on the forehead and walks away. The scene shifts to a bedroom in Winterfell, where CATELYN is fixing SANSA’S hair.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: He’s so handsome.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[CATELYN rolls her eyes.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Sansa…
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Please, please. It’s the only thing I ever wanted.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[Scene shifts to the Winterfell banquet. Laughter, music, KING ROBERT getting bawdy with a wench. CATELYN and CERSEI watch, CATELYN embarrassed for CERSEI, who looks disgusted. Out in the courtyard, JON takes out his frustration on a fencing dummy. His uncle BENJEN rides up.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: Is he dead yet?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Uncle Benjen!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[They hug.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: Well, you’re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: So take me with you when you go back.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: Jon…
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: The Wall isn’t going anywhere.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: I’m ready to swear your oath.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: I don’t care about that.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: You might, if you knew what it meant. … I’d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[BENJEN goes to the banquet.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: What’re you doing back there?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION (drinking): Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JON looks angry and turns away.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JON: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[TYRION departs. JON picks up his sword and attacks the dummy with new ferocity.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The scene shifts back to the banquet, in full raucous swing. NED is off to himself; BENJEN comes up to him.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: You at a feast -- It’s like a bear in a trap.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: The two he was with are still missing.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: A wildling ambush.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Winter is coming.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[ROBB approaches.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: Uncle Benjen.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BENJEN: Robb boy. How are ye?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: I’m good.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[KING ROBERT gets even more bawdy with a wench.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN (in desperation) Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: Yes. Lovely country.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[They observe SANSA.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[SANSA approaches and smiles shyly at CERSEI.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Thirteen, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: You’re tall. Still growing?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: I think so, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: And have you bled yet?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA (discomfited): No, Your Grace.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: And your dress. Did you make it?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[SANSA nods yes.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: Such talent. You must make something for me.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[SANSA departs.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI (to CATELYN): I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: I hear the same.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[SANSA and JOFFREY catch each other’s eye. JOFFREY smiles at her and she turns to her friend.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JAIME and NED meet up. JAIME blocks their path.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Your pardon.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: I don’t fight in tournaments.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: No? Getting a little old for it?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: Well said.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[ARYA flips food onto SANSA’s face.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	SANSA: Arya!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[CATELYN signals a laughing ROBB to deal with the girls. He hoists up ARYA.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBB: Time for bed.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The scene shifts to after the banquet. NED and CATELYN are in their bed.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: I’m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: I won’t let him take you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: The king takes what he wants. That’s why he’s king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: I’ll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.’
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: How did he get so fat?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[There’s a knock at the door.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	A VOICE: It’s Maester Luwin, my lord.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Send him in.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	LUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He hands CATELYN a sealed note.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: Stay.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: This was sent from the Eyrie. What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[CATELYN reads the note, looks up in alarm, and then burns it.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: What news?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: She’s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn’t know what she’s saying.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	LUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	LUWIN: The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help. He’s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CATELYN: He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	LUWIN: A different time. Different king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The scene shifts to the wild wedding celebration of KHAL DROGO and DAENERYS. Fighting and fornication. DAENERYS looks stricken at everything around her.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: When?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: When their omens favor war.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The sex and violence intensify. Two men fight to the death over a woman each is trying to rape. KHAL DROGO watches avidly.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[A knight in Westerosi garb appears. KHAL DROGO greets him in Dothraki. It is JORAH MORMONT, bearing books.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JORAH: A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JORAH: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[DANY is presented with a chest with three dragon eggs in it.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ILLYRIO: Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: Thank you, Magister.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[KHAL DROGO rises and strides forward. DAENERYS follows him, looking sick with fear. The Dothraki crowd behind her as she goes. The KHAL leads her to a white mare.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: She’s beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JORAH: There is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The KHAL puts DANY on her horse and mounts his.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	VISERYS: Make him happy.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The scene shifts to the seaside at sunset. The KHAL begins to unwrap DANY’s dress. She is sobbing. He touches the tears on her face.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	KHAL DROGO: No.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: Do you know the Common Tongue?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	KHAL DROGO: No.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	DAENERYS: Is ‘no’ the only word that you know?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	KHAL DROGO: No.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He takes off her gown and bends her down.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The scene shifts to Winterfell. Tyrion and the Hound are seated outside the day after the banquet.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THE HOUND: Rough night, Imp?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THE HOUND: I didn’t pick you for a hunter.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	TYRION: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	THE HOUND: It’s not hunting if you pay for it.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The king and Ned come into view.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: No, but I’m still better than you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: I know what I’m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You’re a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I’ve got.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	NED: I hope I’ll serve you well.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	ROBERT: You will. And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[The king’s party rides off, NED nodding goodbye to BRAN, whose wolf pup begins sniffing at his feet.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: Come on, you.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[BRAN begins climbing, his wolf pup crying at the bottom of the castle wall. As he nears the top, he hears a woman and man moaning. Peering in the window, he sees CERSEI and JAIME having sex. CERSEI sees BRAN.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: Stop. STOP.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JAIME runs and grabs BRAN at the window.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: Are you completely mad?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: He saw us.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: It’s all right. It’s all right.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	CERSEI: He saw us!
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?
s01e01	Winter is Coming	BRAN: Ten
s01e01	Winter is Coming	.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: Ten.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[JAIME looks at CERSEI, who gazes back imploringly.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	JAIME: The things I do for love.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	[He shoves BRAN out the window.]
s01e01	Winter is Coming	/ BLACKOUT /
s01e01	Winter is Coming	The first episode of the Game of Thrones series starts, typically, in the icy cold beyond the wall. Things don’t get any warmer as we meet the show’s characters for the first time.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	The plot (Released by HBO): Lord Stark is troubled by reports from a Night’s Watch deserter; King Robert and the Lannisters arrive at Winterfell; Viserys Targaryen forges a new alliance.
s01e01	Winter is Coming	The title is a reference to the motto of the house Stark “Winter Is Coming”.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys on horseback looking at Drogo and his people.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jorah Mormont: You need to drink, child... And eat.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen: Isn't there anything else?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses. People can't live on grass... In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end… It'll get easier.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arriving at camp, Daenerys looks exhausted from riding.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: Khaleesi!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Irri: Your hands.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	After Daenerys is escorted away, Jorah and Viserys are alone.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jorah Mormont: We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Viserys Targaryen: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jorah Mormont: As you wish, your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Viserys Targaryen: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jorah Mormont: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Viserys Targaryen: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey finding Tyrion asleep in the dog’s pen of Winterfell.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: What good will my sympathies do them?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: One word and I'll hit you again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: I'm telling mother!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: You can't...
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Do you understand?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sandor Clegane: The Prince will remember that, little lord.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion walks from the courtyard to the dining hall where his family is eating breakfast.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: Little brother.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Beloved siblings.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Myrcella Baratheon: Is Bran going to die?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Apparently not.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: What do you mean?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: The Maester says the boy may live.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	In Bran’s room with Catelyn at his bedside, Cersei coming to console.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: Please.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  I would have dressed, your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: I never knew.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon:  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  I am grateful..
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: Perhaps this time she'll listen.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	Near the Smith in a courtyard of Winterfell.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: A sword for the wall?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: I already have one.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: Good man. Have you swung it yet?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: Of course I have.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister:  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: Soon enough.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jaime Lannister: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya’s room, packing things for her trip to King’s Landing, having her direwolf assist her. Jon comes in to say goodbye before he leaves for the Night's Watch.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. "My things weren't properly folded", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: It's good you've got help.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  Impressive.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  A present?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  It's so skinny.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: I can be quick.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: I think so.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  I know which end to use.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon walks into Bran’s room, where Catelyn is still at his bedside.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  I came to say goodbye to Bran.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  You've said it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: I want you to leave.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard walks into the room, Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  I have no choice.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  You can. You must.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	In the courtyard, Jon prepping his horse to leave for the Wall.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  You Starks are hard to kill.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark: My mother?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  She was very kind.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  It was always my color.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark: Farewell, Snow.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  And you, Stark.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	At the split between the Kingsroad and the road that will take Benjen and Jon to the Wall.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Stopping for rest along the Kingsroad. Robert has a mini table set up full of wine and food.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  I've half a mind to go with you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: You should have asked me 20 years ago.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  I recall a few chances.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  Bessie. She was one of yours.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  Wylla.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  Nor will I.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: She's little more than a child.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  Tell me we're not speaking of this.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon:  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon:  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Back across the sea, Drogo fornicates with Daenerys, she’s clearly not enjoying it.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	On their way to the Wall, stopping to set up camp for the night.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Benjen Stark: Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: Why do you read so much?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Look at me and tell me what you see.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow:  Is this a trick?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister:  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: Until your brother killed that King.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister:  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon Snow: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Tyrion Lannister: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	Bran’s bedroom, Catelyn still at his bedside, Maester Luwin walks in.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Maester Luwin: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  Talk to Poole about it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Maester Luwin: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: I don't care about appointments!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark:  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Maester Luwin: Very good, my Lord. My Lady.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark:  When was the last time you left this room?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  I have to take care of him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf’s howling repeatedly)
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark:  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Assassin: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  No!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	The man is an assassin, when he draws his blade, Catelyn begins to fend him off. In the process her hands are both sliced. The man walks within inches of Bran and his direwolf comes in and mauls the assassin.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	In Daenerys’ tent across the Narrow Sea.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen:  Have you ever seen a dragon?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Irri: Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen:  Everywhere? Even in the east?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Irri: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jhiqui: It is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen: The moon?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Irri: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jhiqui: It is known.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Irri leaves the tent.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen: How old were you?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen:  Nine?!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen:  Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: Yes.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen: Will it take three years?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jon, Tyrion, Benjen and company arrive at the wall and look at it from afar.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Benjen Stark: Welcome.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn is on the ground where Bran’s body was discovered, below the tower he fell from. She looks up and sees the window. She now is looking through that same window where Bran fell. She investigates the room, noticing a cleared patch on some flooring, finding a long blonde hair.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb, Theon Greyjoy, Rodrick and Maester Luwin.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Maester Luwin: The boy was always sure-footed before.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Theon Greyjoy: Saw what, my lady?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Rodrick Cassel: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark:  They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Theon Greyjoy: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Maester Luwin: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark:  I'll ride to King's Landing.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark:  Mother, you can't.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark: I must.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Rodrick Cassel: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Rodrick Cassel: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robb Stark:  What about Bran?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Catelyn Stark:  I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.

s01e02	The Kingsroad	Back at Daenerys’ tent, Doreah is on top of her, “teaching” Daenerys how to please Khal Drogo.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen: Finish a man?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen:  Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen:  I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Doreah: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Daenerys Targaryen:  No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	The Lannisters, traveling Starks and all royal guards have stopped for the evening to rest on their way to King’s Landing.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark:  Pardon me, Ser.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sandor Clegane: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark:  I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sandor Clegane: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	In a field next to a river, off from where everyone else is.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Mycah: I'll get you!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark:  Arya!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: What are you doing here? Go away.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  Your sister? And who are you, boy?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Mycah: Mycah, my Lord.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark: He the butcher's boy.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: He's my friend.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Mycah: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Mycah: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: Stop it!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark:  Arya, stay out of this.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark:  No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  I'll gut you, you little cunt!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark: Arya!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya then steps in and fights with Joffrey, disarming him and putting him on his back. Her direwolf sees this as a thread and runs in to defend.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  Nymeria!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  Please don't.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark:  Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon: Then go! Don't touch me.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	A hunt has begun for the direwolf that attacked Joffrey.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Soldier 1: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya hidden from everyone telling her direwolf to leave.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Soldier 2: It's a direwolf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Soldier 1: I'll check down here.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Soldier 2: I think I heard a noise.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  Go!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jory comes to tell Ned that his daughter has been found.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jory Cassel: My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Where is she?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jory Cassel: She's been taken directly before the King.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Who took her?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jory Cassel: The Lannisters found her.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Right, get back.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Jory Cassel: The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Back! Back to the inn. All back!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Now back at the Inn where everyone is staying.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  I'm sorry.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Are you hurt?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: No.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon:  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  That's not what happened!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  Liar!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Joffrey Baratheon:  Shut up!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: In bed asleep.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark: I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: Liar! Liar liar liar!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark: Arya!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Stop it! That's enough of that.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark:  Liar liar liar!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Stop! Arya!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon:  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon:  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: Gladly, your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon:  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: I'd forgot the damned wolf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Soldier: We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: So be it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: We have another wolf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon:  As you will.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: You can't mean it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Robert Baratheon: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark: He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Arya Stark: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sansa Stark:  Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: s this your command... your Grace?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon:  Where is the beast?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Soldier: Chained up outside, your Grace.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Cersei Baratheon: Is this some trick?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark:  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Once outside, before Eddard lays to rest the direwolf.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard Stark: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Sandor Clegane: He ran... Not very fast.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Eddard kills the direwolf on the King’s orders.
s01e02	The Kingsroad	Season 1, Episode 2
s01e02	The Kingsroad	The Lannisters plot to ensure Bran’s silence; Jon and Tyrion head to the Wall; Ned faces a family crisis en route to King’s Landing
s01e03	Lord Snow	The King, Eddard and the rest of the posse have arrived at King’s Landing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	King’s Landing Guard: Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jory Cassel: Yes, my Lord.
s01e03	Lord Snow	King’s Landing Guard: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
s01e03	Lord Snow	Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Ned’s disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber. First they walk through the Great Hall, where the throne sits. Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  But you just stood there and watched.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  You served him well, when serving was safe.
s01e03	Lord Snow	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e03	Lord Snow	Ned enters the small council’s chamber where the others are already awaiting him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys: Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Lord Varys.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Renly Baratheon: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grand Maester Pycelle: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grand Maester Pycelle: How many years has it been? You were a young man.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: And you served another King.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grand Maester Pycelle: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Without the King?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Renly Baratheon: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  We are the lords of small matters here.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Renly Baratheon: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Mmm, how much?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grand Maester Pycelle: Can the treasury bear such expense?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  How could you let this happen?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Renly Baratheon: "Counting coppers," he calls it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei tending to Joffrey’s “wound”.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: Please, it's nearly healed.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  It's ugly.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon: Do I have to marry her?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  I don't want to.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: How would you handle them?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon:  A royal army?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: And if the northerners rebel?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  For me. I'm their King.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon:  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not asking.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Joffrey Baratheon:  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon:  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya, Sansa and their Septa are all around a table eating. Arya is stabbing a knife into the table between her fingers.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Septa Mordane: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark:  I'm practicing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Sansa Stark:  Practicing for what?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: The Prince.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Septa Mordane: Arya, stop!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Sansa Stark: The Hound killed your friend.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Sansa Stark: You're an idiot.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Septa Mordane: Enough!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Septa Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  What's happening here?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Septa Mordane: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…
s01e03	Lord Snow	Ned places a wrapped package in front of Sansa on the table.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Sansa Stark: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Septa Mordane: You've barely eaten a thing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  It's all right. Go on.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Sansa gets up from the table, leaving only Ned and Septa Mordane.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: War was easier than daughters.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya is unsheathing Needle privately in her room as Ned knocks on the door.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: Go away!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark:  Mine.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Come here. Now what do you want with this?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark:  It's called Needle.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: [laughs] That's the essence of it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: So was I! He is a liar.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: Winter is coming.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: I don't hate her. Not really.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: I can keep it?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Bran’s bedside in Winterfell. A crow lands on his windowsill.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Old Nan:  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Bran Stark:  I hate your stories.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Old Nan:  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Bran Stark: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Old Nan: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robb walks into the room, interrupting Old Nan’s story.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robb Stark:  What are you telling him now?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Old Nan: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robb Stark:  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Bran Stark:  Maybe we do.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robb Stark:  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Bran Stark:  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robb Stark: Don't ever say that.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Bran Stark: I'd rather be dead.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn and Rodrick arrive at King’s Landing, entering through a back entrance.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rodrick Cassel: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rodrick Cassel: My Lady.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Two guards pull up to her on horseback and hand her a scroll, informing her that she is to follow them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Guard: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  I would. We've done nothing wrong.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Guard: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...
s01e03	Lord Snow	Guard: Follow me, Lady Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	At Baelish’s brothel.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
s01e03	Lord Snow	Two naked whores interrupt, Baelish snaps at them to leave.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: A dear friend told me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys:  Lady Stark.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  Lord Varys.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys:  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: How did you know I was coming?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys:  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  Do you know whose dagger this is?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Varys:  I must admit I do not.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  Yours?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: To whom?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.

s01e03	Lord Snow	At Castle Black, in a courtyard. Grenn and Jon are swordfighting, Jon getting the best of him and breaking his nose.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Alliser Thorne: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Pyp steps forward and with one move Jon has him on his back.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Alliser Thorne: Next!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon quickly dispatches of another newcomer, we see Lord Commander Jeor and Tyrion looking on from a balcony.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Alliser Thorne: Next!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Another man starts againt Jon Snow, as another joins, Jon defeats the two of them almost instantly.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Alliser Thorne: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion and Lord Commander talking, overlooking the courtyard.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: A charming man.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jeor Mormont: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jeor Mormont: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: Good news or bad?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jeor Mormont: Both.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Back in the throne room, just outside of the small council chambers.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  My wife is in Winterfell.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Is she?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Baelish leads Ned to the entrance of his brothel. Ned is not so keen on the idea and begins choking Baelish.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: You're a funny man. A very funny man.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon is in the armory of Castle Black, putting away equipment when a gang of the guys jump him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grenn: You broke my nose, bastard!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow:  It's an improvement.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grenn: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Pyp: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grenn: What're you looking at, halfman?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rast: What do you care about our faces?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Grenn: We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: They hate me because I'm better than they are.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
s01e03	Lord Snow	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e03	Lord Snow	At Baelish’s brothel.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: We have proof. We have the blade.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Petyr Baelish:  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
s01e03	Lord Snow	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e03	Lord Snow	In the Queen’s chambers.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: How could you be so stupid?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: Calm down.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: Then what are you raving about?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: And my husband?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : "The War for Cersei's Cunt."
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei hits Jaime, he spins her around and hugs her from behind, whispering into her ear.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: Never.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
s01e03	Lord Snow	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e03	Lord Snow	In a back alley before Catelyn leaves King’s Landing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark:  I wish I could see the girls.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  It's too dangerous.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: Just for a moment.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Until we know who our enemies are...
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark:  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Cersei Baratheon: And if you find the proof?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: He still loves you.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Catelyn Stark: Does he?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Eddard Stark: Off with you.

s01e03	Lord Snow	In the King’s chambers, he’s drinking and eating at a table.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon:  It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Barristan Selmy: Of course, your Grace.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon:  Who was it?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Barristan Selmy: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon: How'd you do it?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Barristan Selmy: Lance through the heart.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait!"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Lancel Lannister: It's empty, your Grace.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon: What do you mean it's empty?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Lancel Lannister: There's no more wine.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon:  Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Barristan Selmy: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Barristan Selmy: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon: Your outlaw... Any last words?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: I cut his head off, so no.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Robert Baratheon: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jaime Lannister: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...

s01e03	Lord Snow	Riding horseback and walking through fields.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen: : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont:  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen: From whom?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont:  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys sees one of the Dothraki men strike a slave with a whip for not moving fast enough.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen: Tell them all to stop.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen:  Until I command them otherwise.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont:  You're learning to talk like a Queen.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys dismounts her horse and walks through the field off of the path. She hears noises coming towards her and grass snapping. Her brother Viserys storms into the clearing on horseback wielding a sword.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Viserys Targaryen: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Viserys has his sword to Daenerys’ throat. Rakharo whips Viserys, wrapping it around his neck and yanking him to his back.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen:  No!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen:  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Viserys Targaryen: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont:  Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: You walk. [to Viserys]

s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon and Benjen looking out over the wall. Benjen saying goodbye.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark:  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: You're leaving?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow:  What kind of reports?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark:  The kind I don't want to believe.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: 'm ready. I won't let you down.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: But I'm better than every...
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren and Tyrion getting drunk on wine in a the mess hall of Castle Black.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: A bear's balls.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: You're joking?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: And how do a bear's balls taste?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen enters.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark:  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark: Call me what you like.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark:  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Benjen Stark:  Enjoy the capital, brother.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: I always do.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Yoren: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri is braiding Daenerys hair and teaching her Dothraki. She feels Daenerys’ breast.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: Yes, Khaleesi.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen:  What are you doing?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah and Rakharo around a fire in a tent.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont:  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont: Armor.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont:  Slow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: Slow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont:  I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: There are no rabbits.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont: I don't think she wants to eat dog.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rakharo: A blessing from the Great Stallion.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Irri: She does not want to eat horse.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Rhakaro: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jorah Mormont: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Back again in the courtyard of Castle Black. Jon is battling his brothers in black as Tyrion overlooks from the balcony. Jon continuing to defeat them, he begins teaching them.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion reenters the hall to speak and drink with Aemon and Lord Commander.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Maester Aemon: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  Eight... no, nine.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Maester Aemon: All of them brief?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Maester Aemon: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jeor Mormont: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jeor Mormont: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Maester Aemon: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jeor Mormont: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Maester Aemon: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.

s01e03	Lord Snow	The Khal and Daenerys are intertwined in their tent via candlelight. Daenerys surprises Drogo and speaks Dothraki to him.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen:  It’s a boy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Khal Drogo: How do you know?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Daenerys Targaryen: I know.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion is pissing off of the wall, when he’s done, Jon and him converse near a fire.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow:  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow:  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister:  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow:  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: Of course.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: He'll never walk again.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Tyrion Lannister: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Jon Snow: Farewell, My Lord.

s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya arrives to her “dance lesson” in King’s Landing.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel:  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark:  Who are you?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio throws a wooden sword to Arya, she does not catch it, but drops it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark:  It's too heavy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel:  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: What if I drop it?
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark: I'm a girl.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel:  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya Stark:  A needle.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel: Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Arya takes several attempts as Syrio turns his back, defending her and disarming her constantly. She begins picking up on a few things, but still needs much work. Ned enters in the doorway and his smile turns to a grimace watching his daughter swordfight.
s01e03	Lord Snow	Syrio Forel: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.

s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	King's Landing, Ned Stark arrives at the grounds where the Tourney of the Hand will take place. He enters a tent where Ser Hugh (deceased) is being tended to, he enters to speak with Barristan.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: He'd never worn this armor before.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Who determines the draw?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned and Barristan both exit the tent and begin walking.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Yes. That will never happen.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Barristan Selmy: Robert tends to do what he wants.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned separates from Barristan and enters King Robert’s tent. Lancel, Robert’s squire, is attempting to dress him in his armor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lancel Lannister: It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You're too fat for your armor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Both Robert and Ned begin laughing. Lancel also starts to laugh.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Oh, it’s funny, is it?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lancel Lannister: No, Your Grace.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You're torturing the poor boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lancel runs out of the tent.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: The breastplate stretcher?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: How long before he figures it out?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Maybe you should have one invented.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: And who's going to hit you back?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark:There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Aye.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: … Drink.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I'm not thirsty.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Your squire... A Lannister boy?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. "Cersei Lannister will make a good match", he told me. "You'll need her father on your side." I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Robert?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!

s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Now at the jousting track where there are lots of onlookers, cheering. Ser Gregor bows before the King before he and his horse take off down one lane of the track.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Where's Arya
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sansa Stark: At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sansa Stark: Thank you, Ser Loras.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	After bowing to Sansa, Loras exchanges looks with Renly Baratheon. Loras then rides and bows before the King, also taking off down the opposite track.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sansa Stark: Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Hey.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sansa Stark: I can't watch.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Behind Ned and Sansa.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: I'll take that bet.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Or you could even buy a friend.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sansa Stark: He's going to die.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Ser Loras rides well.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	A trumpet is heard and both competitors race down their lanes. Loras knocks Ser Gregor off of his mount.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sansa Stark: Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: No honor but quite a bit of gold.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Gregor gets up off of the ground, shouts for his sword. His squire brings it to him and then Gregor severs his horse’s head completely off. The crowd is stunned, Gregor then attacks Loras. Knocking him off of his horse and striking him with his sword. Sandor, the Hound, runs down from the stands and fends off his brother.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Stop this madness in the name of your King!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sandor takes a bow and Gregor storms off. Loras walks up to Sandor, raising his hand in victory.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: I owe you my life, Ser.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Sandor Clegane: I'm no Ser.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Stopping for rest, presumed on the Kingsroad on their way to Winterfell.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: Remove his hood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Marillion: On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: I did... often and loudly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: And why would I do that?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: Five years ago.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: I am not a murderer, Lannister.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: The dagger found
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Rodrik Cassel: Should I gag him?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Why? Am I starting to make sense?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Rodrik Cassel: My Lady, this way.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	A rock slams into one of Catelyn’s men, a hill tribe begins to attack. Rodrik moves Catelyn behind a rock, out of harms way. The men, mainly Bronn begin successfully defending against the tribe. Tyrion sees Catelyn pull out a small dagger, he runs over to her and convinces her to cut him loose.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Untie me. If I die, what's the point?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion, now loose, runs over and picks up a shield. He fends off an attack as another of Lady Stark’s men kills him. Another tribesman is nearing Catelyn, Tyrion rushes over with his shield, knocks him to the ground and begins slamming it into his throat, directly in front of, and in defense of Catelyn. The battle comes to an end with many of their men defeated.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: Rodrik?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Rodrik Cassel: I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bronn:  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Well, I'm willing if she is.

s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Back at Winterfell, Maester Luwin and Bran are at a small table, Luwin trying to teach Bran. Bran is fixed on watching Theon as he is practicing his archery.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Bran...
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - "We do not sow".
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Lords?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: The Greyjoys.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: And failed rebellions.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Good.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Words - "Ours is the fury". Lords - the Baratheons.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin:: Mhmm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Hmm...
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: No. A common saying, but not their official motto.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Lords - the Lannisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: We're still on their words.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: I don't know them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: You do know them. Think.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: "Unbowed, unbent, unbroken".
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin:That's House Martell.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: "Righteous in wrath".
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: House Hornwood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: "Family, duty, honor".
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin:Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: "Family, duty, honor"... Is that the right order?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin:You know it is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Family comes first?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: And then she left!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Why did she leave?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Do you know where she is now? Today?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin:No, I don't.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: I'll never shoot another arrow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: And where is that written?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: You need legs to work a bow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bran Stark: Really?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Maester Luwin: Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Now in Theon’s quarters inside Winterfell, he’s making love to Ros.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	They break.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Important enough for the likes of you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: Jealous?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Why should I be jealous?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: Might surprise you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Hmm?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: You are jealous.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: And what about the Starks?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: A “ward”, that’s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon grabs Ros’ neck from behind.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: You’re a very serious boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: I’m not a boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Theon Greyjoy: I don’t want to pay for it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ros: Then get yourself a wife.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya, at King’s Landing is running through the halls chasing a cat. She’s seen running down a hallway.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned is in his chambers at his desk, Varys is speaking to him, walking around securing all of the windows before sitting down to talk more seriously.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: How is your son, my Lord?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: He'll never walk again.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: But his mind is sound?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: So they say.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys:A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: I didn't trust you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: So why do you trust me now?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: What sort of doom does the King face?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Who gave it to him?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: The squire, Ser Hugh?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Someone who could afford it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: He started asking questions.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	We shift to a dark dungeon of King’s Landing. Arya is still chasing the cat. She stops to admire a large dragon’s skull. She hears two men talking, and hides from them, just in earshot. The two men are Lord Varys and Magister Illyrio Mopatis.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Illyrio Mopatis: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Illyrio Mopatis: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: This Hand is not the other.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Illyrio Mopatis: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: "Delay," you say. "Move fast, " I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Illyrio Mopatis: It never was.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	The two men leave, Varys locks a gate behind them. Arya runs to the gate and can’t get out. She takes off in the other direction, deeper into the dungeon, to find an exit.

s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys enters the Throne Room, where Baelish is standing, looking at the throne.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: You do move quietly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: We all have our qualities.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Strictly speaking.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Saw me with your own eyes?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Eyes I own.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: One shudders at the thought.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Oh.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Have you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Was that you under the bed?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Oh, please.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly enters from a different doorway and cuts both men off.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: To a small council meeting?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya exits a tunnel outside of King’s Landing, at the beach of Blackwater Bay. She heads to the city’s gate but is stopped by two guards.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Guard 1: Off with you. No begging.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: I'm not a beggar. I live here.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Guard 1: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: I want to see my father.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Guard 2: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Guard 1: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Quick cut to Arya standing in front of Ned at his desk.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: They said they were going to kill you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Who did?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Oh, Arya.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Where did you hear this?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: What were you doing in the dungeons?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: Chasing a cat.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	A knock at the door, Jory pokes his head in.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Your name, friend?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Yoren: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: I'm a girl!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Did Benjen send you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Yoren: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Ah, we'll find recruits for you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Yoren: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Know what?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Yoren: Best said in private, my Lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Go on. We'll talk more later.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Jory, take her safely to her room.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory escorts Arya to her room.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: How many guards does my father have?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Arya Stark: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: No fear on that count, little Lady.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned and Yoren are now alone in Ned’s chambers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Well?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Yoren: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	As Catelyn, Tyrion and her men are arriving to the Vale, they’re met by a group of guards.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Vardis Egen: You're far from home, Lady Stark.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: To whom do I speak?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Vardis Egen: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: There was no time to send word.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Vardis Egen: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Vardis Egen: He doesn't look like a prisoner.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: My sister will decide what he looks like.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Vardis Egen: Yes, my Lady. She will at that.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	The guards all turn their horses and escort Catelyn and her men towards the Eyrie.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Bronn: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: I like you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned is walking through a courtyard at King’s Landing, heading for the King Robert’s chambers. He is stopped by a royal steward.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Steward: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I need to see the King first -- alone.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Steward: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Is it about my wife?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Steward: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Now at the small council meeting with everyone on the council, as well as King Robert.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: The whore is pregnant.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You're speaking of murdering a child.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Then we're no better than the Mad King.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Careful, Ned. Careful now.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Based on whose information?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Varys: I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Grand Maester Pycelle: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: We should have had them both killed years ago.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I followed you into war -  twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: She dies.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I will have no part in it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned removes his badge and places it on the table in front of Robert.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned is in his chambers quickly packing his things.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word "treason" was mentioned.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: What can I do for you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: When do you return to Winterfell?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Why? What do you care?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I don't have the time.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Baelish exits Ned’s chambers, Ned speaks to Jory briefly and then takes off for Baelish.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: Heward and Wyl.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Find them and meet me at the stables.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	At the Eyrie, Catelyn, her men, and Tyrion are all standing in front of Lady Arryn. Her son is sitting on her lap, breastfeeding. He is clearly too old to be doing so.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, "the seed is strong." He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robin Arryn: Mommy? Is that the bad man?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: It is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robin Arryn: He's little.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Tyrion Lannister: If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robin Arryn: You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robin Arryn: Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: Perhaps you will, my little love.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Catelyn Stark: This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Mord throws Tyrion into a “skycell.”
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Mord: You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!

s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Back at King’s Landing, inside Renly Baratheon’s chambers. He is sitting, shirtless, with Loras Tyrell kneeling beside him shaving his chest. Loras is also shirtless.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: You're jealous.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Are you sure this won't hurt?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Only if I slip.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: And you prefer me like this?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Mhmm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: I want you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Hold still.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon:His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Yes well, I guess we'll never know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Finished with Renly’s chest, Loras raises his arm so he can shave his armpit.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Everywhere?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: I have an outrageous amount of money.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Not as much as the Lannisters.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: But a lot more than you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Hmm... How did that ever happen?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Do you know who should be King?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Be serious.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: I'm fourth in line.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: Stannis?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: He's still my older brother.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras cuts Renly under his arm.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: What are you doing?!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: Look at it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Renly Baratheon: You cut me!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Loras Tyrell: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.

s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei enters King Robert’s chambers.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Is my father wrong?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: We still outnumber them.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Five.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: What do you want?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Our marriage.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	The two begin laughing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Every day.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: How long can hate hold a thing together?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: Yes, it is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Yes, it tis. What was she like?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: So why now?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: I felt something for you once, you know?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: I know.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Robert Baratheon: No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Cersei Baratheon: It doesn't make me feel anything.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Inside one of Baelish’s brothels, Ned is speaking to one of the prostitutes. Jory and Baelish are in the next room.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Mhaegen: She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Aye.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Mhaegen: Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I will.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Mhaegen: And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Mhaegen: He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned breaks off from Mhaegen and enters the same room as Baelish and Jory.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Well, he has more than you, for a start.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: How many?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Come.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory is staring at one of the whores, who flashes him her breast.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: Jory!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: My Lord.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Ned and Jory leave the brothel with a few of Ned’s men. They are suddenly surround by Jaime Lannister and his men.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: Such a small pack of wolves.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: What's the meaning of this, Lannister?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: I remember him well.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark:He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime draws his sword, causing all of them men on both sides to draw their swords, except for Eddard.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Petyr Baelish: My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jory Cassel: If you threaten my Lord again...
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: Threaten? As in, "I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Eddard Stark: You kill me, your brother's a dead man.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	A fight erupts, first Jaime’s men throw spears straight into the chests of two of Ned’s men. Ned draws his sword and moves towards Jaime, fending off several guards in the process. Jory gets to Jaime first. Jaime stabs Jory with a dagger straight through his eye. The fighting ceases and Ned moves forward to Jaime, Jaime’s men all stop to watch the fight. The two fend each other off, as they break, one of Jaime’s guards stabs Ned in the back of the leg with a spear, causing him to fall to the ground. Jaime is openly frustrated and knocks the guard out. He mounts his horse.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime Lannister: My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.
s01e05	The Wolf and the Lion	Jaime rides off on horseback and his guards follow suit.

s01e06	A Golden Crown	Opens at King’s Landing, assumed to be Ned’s quarters. He opens his eyes to find Cersei and King Robert at his bedside.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark: Your pardon, your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: Do you know what your wife has done?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  She did nothing I did not command.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Who’d have thought she had it in her?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  I am the King’s Hand -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: You were the King’s Hand!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  - trying to keep the peace -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: You shall now be held accountable.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark: He butchered my men.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: I took you for a king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Hold your tongue.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert smacks Cersei.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei Baratheon: I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Cersei exits the room, slamming the door shut behind her.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  If we don’t act… there will be a war.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing. She’s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: I’m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don’t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don’t want to know. This is what matters - I can’t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other’s throats, so enough!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I’m the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true. You were the brother I chose. We’ll talk when I return from the hunt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert throws the Hand of the King’s badge onto the bed where Ned is laying.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark: The hunt?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Killing things clears my head. You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away. You’ll hate it more than I do.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark: The Targaryen girl -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Seven hells! Don’t start with her again! The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I’ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert exits the room, slamming the door shut behind him. Ned picks up the badge and looks at it.

s01e06	A Golden Crown	Back at Vaes Dothrak across the sea, Daenerys is holding one of her prized dragon eggs. She looks up at a pot of coals inside of her tent. She walks over and places the egg into the coals. Irri walks into the tent.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Irri: Khaleesi?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys picks up the egg from the coals.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Irri: Oh, Khaleesi!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Irri takes the egg from her hands, dropping it instantly because of the heat. She looks at Daenerys’ hands and there are no burn marks. The two compare hands, Irri’s have burn marks.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys Targaryen: You’re hurt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	A raven caws. Bran is shooting his bow in the courtyard. The raven flies to the crypts of Winterfell, Bran follows. As he enters, again making eye contact with the bird. The raven flies deeper into the crypts. We then see Bran sleeping in his bed, showing that this was another vision, we hear footsteps running towards his door. His door swings opens and Bran sits up in bed breathing heavily. Hodor is carrying the contraption that Tyrion brought the blueprints for. Bran smiles. We then cut to the woods of Winterfell where Bran is shouting as he’s riding on the back of a horse.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: Not too fast.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: When are you gonna tell him?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: Not now.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: You’re talking about war.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: I’m talking about justice.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark:You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: You’re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They’ve already started the war. It’s your duty to represent your House when your father can’t.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: And it’s not your duty, because it’s not your House.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	It goes silent, Bran can no longer be heard jeering at his horse. Robb looks at Theon and stands up looking through the woods.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: Where’s Bran?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: I don’t know. It’s not my House.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon stands up and walks away from Robb, who begins to look around. We cut to Bran riding slowly through the woods. We see someone creeping up behind him as his horse is nickering. As Bran enters a clearing, several Wildlings surround him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: Robb?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Osha: All alone in the deep dark woods.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: I’m not alone, my brother is with me.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Wildling: I don’t see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Osha: Oh, that’s a pretty pin. Silver.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Wildling: We’ll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: I can’t. The saddle, the straps.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Wildling: What’s wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don’t let me be, I’ll have you all killed!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Wildling 2: Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Osha: the boy’s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark’s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	A Wildling is cutting Bran’s straps to his saddle, accidentally slicing into Bran’s leg but he feels no pain.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Wildling: Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We’re going as far south as south goes. There ain’t no white walkers down in Dorne.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb comes into view, behind the four Wildlings.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: Drop the knife. Let him go and I’ll let you live.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	One of the Wildlings storms at Robb who evades an axe attack. Robb counters, slicing the Wildling’s throat. Osha charges Robb who tosses her spins her around by her hair. He fights off and kills the other Wildling. The Wilding in charge has Bran off of his horse with a knife at his throat, meanwhile Robb has Osha (female Wildling) and a knife to her throat.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: Robb!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Wildling: Shut up! Drop the blade!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: No, don’t.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Wildling: Do it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb looks at Bran and then back up at the Wildling. He then slowly sets his sword on the ground, still gripping Osha by her hair. He looks back up at the Wildling who suddenly gets an arrow through his chest from his back. As he drops to the ground bleeding, we see Theona few yards behind him with a bow. The Wildling falls dead, Theon approaches. Robb releases Osha from his grasp as Theon walks over drawing his bow on her. Robb moves over to Bran.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: Are you all right?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bran Stark: Yes, it doesn’t hurt.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you’re not a man until you’ve killed your first enemy. Well done.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: Have you lost your mind? What if you’d missed?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: He would have killed you and cut Bran’s throat.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: You don’t have the right -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: To what, to save your brother’s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: What about her?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Osha: Give me my life, my lord, and I’m yours.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robb Stark: We’ll keep her alive.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Osha gives a sigh of release, Theon releases his bow and Robb, holding Bran, assures that he’s okay.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Now at the Eyrie, Tyrion is sleeping and rolls to his side at the very edge of his skycell. He awakes, quickly moving back to the wall. He steps over to the door to his cell and begins pounding on it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The door swings open and Mord rushes in, batting Tyrion to the opposite side of the cell.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: Dwarf man making noise!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: How would you like to be rich?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: Dwarf man still making noise.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I’m prepared to give you lots of gold.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord quickly searches Tyrion’s pockets for gold.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: No gold!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Well, I don’t have it here.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: No gold! Fuck off.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord hits Tyrion once more with his club then storms out of the cell, shutting the door behind him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Now in a hall at King’s Landing. We see Syrio shutting a door and holding two wooden swords. He slowly steps down towards Arya and tosses her one of the swords, she seamlessly catches it as he takes his fighting stance.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark:  I don’t want to practice today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio Forel: No?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark: They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio Forel: You are troubled.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark:  Yes -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio Forel: Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark: I don’t like dolls and k -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio Forel: You’re not here. You’re with your trouble. If you’re with your trouble when fighting happens…
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya makes a move for Syrio, who quickly counters and puts her on her back.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio Forel: … More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio Forel: The old and the new.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio Forel: There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Syrio steps back and tosses Arya her sword back, she catches it and assumes the counter position.

s01e06	A Golden Crown	Back across the sea in Vaes Dothrak, we’re inside a large communal tent. Daenerys is centered around everyone and eating the heart of a horse a the Dothraki and a priest chant around her. Her husband Khal Drogo looks on in anticipation as she continues eating.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn’t my horse.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: She’s doing well.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: She’ll never keep it down.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	She keeps eating the heart, nearing the end. The Dothraki onlookers all chant in unison, getting louder and louder. The priestess is also chanting, louder and louder. Khal Drogo stares more intently at his wife, she stares back. The chanting grows louder, as does the priestess.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Tell me what she is saying.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: “The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The eating and chantines intensifies as Viserys looks on in shock.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: She’s going to have a boy.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: He won’t be a real Targaryen. He won’t be a true dragon.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	As the chanting is at it’s loudest, Daenerys has finished with the heart. Everyone looks on in anticipations, she wretches forward, on the verge of puking. The chanting suddenly halts. Khal Drogo leans in and looks intensly. Daenerys holds everything in and sobs. Her hands bloody, she slowly sits up, keeping everything in as she gulps the final bite. The priestess begins to speak, Jorah translates directly for Viserys.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jora: “The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys rises to her feet, speaking in Dothraki to the room.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys Targaryen: A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The room begins chanting, “Rhaego! Rhaego!” As the chanting grows louder and louder, Drogo stands up and walks up to Daenerys.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: They love her.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The room’s chanting gets even louder. Drogo hugs his wife at her thighs and hoists her up, carrying her around the room.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: She truly is a queen today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah looks to his right towards Viserys, who has now slipped out. We cut to Daenerys’ tent. Inside, Viserys opens the container that holds her dragon eggs. He sighs and then puts them into a sack. Jorah walks into the tent behind him, blocking the door.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: Don’t let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: It’s not my law.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: They don’t belong to you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Whatever is hers is also mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: Once, perhaps.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: If I sell one egg, I’ll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: And you have all three.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: I need a large army… I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don’t think I know what you want? I don’t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: You can go, but you can’t have the eggs.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: It means everything to me.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: And yet here you stand?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: And here I stand.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys and Jorah stare at each other for a moment, before Viserys drops the sack containing the dragon eggs to the floor. Jorah steps aside, unblocking the exit. Viserys leaves.

s01e06	A Golden Crown	Back at the skycell below the Eyrie. Tyrion is again shouting for Mord.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: Noise again!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: About the gold -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: No gold!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: Where?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell)
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You’re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mord: What message?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	We cut to the throne room, where Lady Arryn and her son Robin are sitting on the throne, at the helm of the room. Catelyn is standing next to them, as Robin is tapping a knife against the throne itself very annoyingly.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: You wish to confess your crimes?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: Silence!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robin Arryn:What happened next?!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: What do you think you’re doing?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Confessing my crimes.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Catelyn Stark: Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Oh, I’m very sorry. I don’t know anything about all that.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: You’ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: I understand the law.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Several men begin unwinding a giant crank on one side of the room. In between Tyrion and the raised throne is what looks like a well. The well’s floor begins to open and wind comes howling through. Robin begins giggling and rapidly clapping his hands. Tyrion looks down and sees that it’s a great distance through this Moon Door to the ground, he would inevitably die if he had to go out this “door”.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Subdued laughter fills the room, Catelyn and Lysa exchange looks.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: You have that right.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Knight 1: My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Knight 2: The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Knight 3: I’ll fight for you, my Lady.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Knight 4: It’ll be my honor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Knight 5: The honor should be mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robin Arryn: Make the bad man fly!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis… You’re quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ser Vardis: With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Agreed.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: You demanded a trial by combat.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ser Vardis: My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: I wouldn’t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The room shudders.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: The trial will be today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Do I have a volunteer?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Again, the majority of the room laughs quietly.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Anyone?... Anyone?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bronn: I’ll stand for the dwarf.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	In the woods, outside of King’s Landing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Oh, what was I saying?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Renly Baratheon: A simpler time.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: It was! It was. You’re too young to remember. Wasn’t it, Selmy?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Barriston: It was, your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Renly Baratheon: Sounds exhilarating.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Renly Baratheon: Once, I think.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: You think? I think you’d remember. Back in our day, you weren’t a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Renly Baratheon: Those were some lucky girls.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: You ever make the eight, Barristan?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Barristan Selmy: I don’t believe so, your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: (laughs) Those were the days!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Renly Baratheon: What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robert Baratheon: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you’re speaking to the King.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Renly Baratheon: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Renly walks off in the opposite direction of the group. Robert takes a large swig off of the wine and quickly continue walking.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	In the throne room of King’s Landing. Ned sits upon the throne as a fill in for Robert, as he is Hand of the King. Baelish is at his right and Grand Maester Pycelle to his left. The room is filled with people.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Man: They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Grand Maester Pycelle: Brigands, most likely.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Man: They weren’t thieves, they didn’t steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Grand Maester Pycelle: It’s the King’s Hand you’re addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	A second man walks forward and empties a sack out onto the floor. It’s a pile of fish.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Petyr Baelish: Fish. The sigil of House Tully. (whispers to Ned) Isn’t that your wife’s House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Man: None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I’ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Petyr Baelish: (whisper) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Grand Maester Pycelle: Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Petyr Baelish: I’ve heard him called “Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Grand Maester Pycelle: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Petyr Baelish: It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Grand Maester Pycelle: Wel…
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Beric Dondarrion steps from the back of the room forward.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Beric Dondarrion: As you command.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ned stands up with the assistance of a cane. He steps forward.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Grand Maester Pycelle: My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester Pycelle.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Grand Maester Pycelle: My Lord.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The men all bow their heads in acknowledgement. Ned steps down from the throne, Baelish follows him, speaking only to Ned.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Petyr Baelish: A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark: Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Back at the Eyrie throne room in the Vale. The men again crank and the Moon Door is opened. Ser Vardis prepares himself with a sword, shield and full body of armor. Bronn refuses a shield and is only wearing leather clothes. Robin Arryn screams “fight” and the two men move forward. Multiple times Vardis swings forward and multiple times Bronn casually steps to the side, causing Vardis to waste his energy. Bronn moves backwards as Vardis continues to swing away, eventually up a staircase. Bronn hops over the staircase railing, again avoiding Vardis’ attacks. Lysa screams “Stand and fight, coward!” Bronn kicks over a candle stand in front of Vardis. Vardis steps over it and is again on the offensive, moving Bronn towards the center of the room, close to the now opened Moon Door. The men hold one another off directly in front of the door, Vardis appearing to have the edge. Robin is giggling as Tyrion looks worried. Bronn muscles Vardis’ blade away from him and steps to the side. Vardis yet again goes excessively offensive and swings for the fences and Bronn keeps stepping away. Vardis moves Bronn again to the middle of the room, as he swings for Bronn’s head, Bronn ducks and stabs Vardis in the belly. The room is in disbelief. Vardis moves forward, muscling through the pain. Bronn side-steps him a few more times and slices through his back. Vardis swings once more, but Bronn shoves his body towards the Moon Door. Bronn is in complete control as Vardis is defenseless against the door. Bronn looks up at Lysa and Robin who have blank faces - faces of shock - so he thrusts his sword into Vardis’ neck, killing him, and pushing him out of the Moon Door.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robin Arryn: Is it over?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Lysa Arryn: You don’t fight with honor!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Bronn: No. He did.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion turns to Mord who uncuffs him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Robin Arryn: Can I make the little man fly now?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Rodrik Cassel tosses Tyrion his purse. Tyrion bows before Catelyn, begins walking out, Bronn following. He tosses Mord the purse full of coins.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Tyrion Lannister: A Lannister always pays his debts.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	At King’s Landing, Sansa Stark and Septa Mordane, both sowing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: Well, why shouldn’t I? We’re in the south.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: It’s important to remember where you come from. I’m not sure your mother would like these new styles.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: My mother isn’t from the North.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: I’m aware of that.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: Yes. I have hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: I’ve never seen it.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: Would you like to?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: I come from a very small village in -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: Oh, wait. I just realized… I don’t care.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: Sansa -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: Septa.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: Now you are being rude.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	A door can be heard closing. Prince Joffrey walks in. Sansa’s eyes light up as both women stand up.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Mordane: My prince.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: My prince.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Joffrey Baratheon:  My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Joffrey offers Sansa a necklace. She turns around, for him to put it on her, as acceptance.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: It’s beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Joffrey Baratheon:  You’ll be queen one day, it’s only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: There’s nothing to forgive.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Joffrey Baratheon: You’re my lady. One day we’ll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them.  I’ll never disrespect you again. I’ll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You’re my lady now, from this day, until my last day.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The two share their first kiss.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	In the woods outside of Winterfell, Theon is riding his horse, alone. He comes to a road and sees a carriage leaving, Ros on the back of it riding south.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: Going to King’s Landing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: In a turnip cart?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: I’ll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: And you can afford that?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: Some of my friends are more generous than others.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: There’s a thousand girls like you in King’s Landing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: I’ll have lots of company…
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: Yes, you’ll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can’t get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: (laughs) And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: Don’t be a fool.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King’s Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there’s nothing more for me here. Let’s go, Steffon.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: Let me see it one more time?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: See what?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The carriage is driving away from Theon, he scrambles and flips Ros a coin. She catches it and lifts up her dress one final time for Theon, while laughing.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Theon Greyjoy: I’m going to miss you!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ros: I know.

s01e06	A Golden Crown	At King’s Landing in Ned’s quarters. Arya and Sansa await as their father limps forward, using his cane for assistance.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  I’m sending you both back to Winterfell.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: What?!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  Listen -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: What about Joffrey?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark:  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you’re sending us home?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  What? No.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: Please, Father. Please don’t.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark:  You can’t. I’ve got my lessons with Syrio. I’m finally getting good.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  This isn’t a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark:  Can’t we take Syrio back with us?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can’t go. I’m supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I’m meant to be his queen and have his babies.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark: Seven hells.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  When you’re old enough, I’ll make you a match with someone who’s worthy of you, someone who’s brave and gentle and strong -
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: I don’t want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He’ll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I’ll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark: The lion’s not his sigil, idiot. He’s a stag, like his father.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: He is not. He’s nothing like that old drunk king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: Wait!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Arya Stark:  Come on! (dragging Sansa)
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Sansa Stark: It’s not fair!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The two exit Ned’s room and close the door behind them. Ned slowly makes his way over to his desk, opening the book that Grand Maester Pycelle had given him earlier. The book covers the lineages of all the great Houses of Westeros. Ned turns and reviews the Baratheon page, reading out loud.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Eddard Stark:  “Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ned has a revelation and closes the book.

s01e06	A Golden Crown	Back at Vaes Dothrak, in a very large hut. It is a celebration. A pig roasts over a center fire as there are drums being played and people dancing everywhere. Viserys stumbles in, clearly drunk.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Daenerys! Where’s my sister?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys and Jorah both look up, noticing her brother on the opposite side of the hut. Drogo, on another side of the hut also sees Viserys. Jorah stands up and begins walking towards Viserys.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys Targaryen: Stop him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Where is she? I’m here for the feast. The whore’s feast.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: Come.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	A man sitting next to Drogo says something in Dothraki that makes the Khal laugh. Viserys hears this and spins around.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Khal Drogo! I’m here for the feast.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Khal Drogo: (speaks Dothraki, motions to the other side of the hut)
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: That is no place for a king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Khal Drogo:  You are no king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys draws his sword, Jorah moves forward, Viserys holds his sword at Jorah.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Keep away from me!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The drums stop and now everyone in the hut is paying attention.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys Targaryen: Viserys, please.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: There she is.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: Put the sword down. They’ll kill us all.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood in their sacred city. (moving his sword over everyone in the room, stopping on Daenerys’ stomach) But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The Khal is fiercely looking at the situation as Viserys has his blade to Daenerys’ stomach. A woman is translating for Drogo as Viserys speaks.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Tell him I want what was bargained for or I’m taking you back. He can keep the baby. I’ll cut it out and leave it for him.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Khal Drogo:  (speaks Dothraki)
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: What’s he saying?
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys Targaryen: He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys takes his blade away from Daenerys’ stomach and steps back, smiling. Drogo stands up and walks to his wife, placing his hand on her belly as they exchange looks. The Khal says something in Dothraki, two men instantly come up behind Viserys, each holding one of his arms. One man breaks Viserys’ right arm as he screams.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The two men force Viserys to the ground, still holding him by his arms. The Khal moves towards them and mutters something in Dothraki. A woman tips over a kettle that was over the fire, pouring out it’s contents. Drogo throws some golden jewelry into the kettle.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: Look away Khaleesi.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys Targaryen: No.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can’t!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	The golden jewelry is now melted down into liquid. Khal Drogo lifts the kettle up and walks over towards the screaming Viserys.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Viserys Targaryen: Dany please!
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Khal Drogo: A crown for a king.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Khal Drogo raises the kettle over Viserys’ head and pours out the melted gold onto his skull. He screams as the hot liquid solidifies on his skull, the two men release Viserys, he instantly falls to the ground dead.
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Jorah Mormont: Khaleesi…
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Daenerys Targaryen: He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.

s01e06	A Golden Crown	Season 1, Episode 6
s01e06	A Golden Crown	Ned sits for the king; Tyrion confesses and demands a trial by combat; Joffrey apologizes; Viserys receives his final payment.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Trumpets sounds from the Lannister camp. Going inside a tent, we see Tywin Lannister sharpening his knifes, preparing to skin a deer, while Jaime Lannister starts reading the received letter from Ned Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  "Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Uh, "arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown."
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Poor Ned Stark. Brave man, terrible judgment.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Attacking him was stupid.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Lannisters don't act like fools.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  Catelyn Stark took my brother.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  Tyrion?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Ned Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  It wouldn't have been clean.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Clean...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Now that's what you want people to think of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  It's the truth.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister: When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  Of course it bothers me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I'm giving you half of our forces. 30,000 men.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime Lannister:  So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Your mother's dead. Before long I'll be dead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground. It's the family name that lives on. It's all that lives on.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Do you understand?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime nods gently.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tywin Lannister:  Hmm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And you are still blessed with youth.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And what have you done with these blessings, huh? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	One a madman, the other a drunk.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I need you to become a man you were always meant to be.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not next year. Not tomorrow. Now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Submissive as he looks, Jaime walks out of the tent.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Back at a garden in Kings Landing, we see Queen Cersei approaching the sitting Ned Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  You're in pain.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  I've had worse, my lady.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Perhaps it's time to go home.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Has he done this before?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Jaime would have killed him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Your brother Or your lover?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.  We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  My son saw you with him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Do you love your children?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  With all my heart.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  No more than I love mine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  And they are all Jaime's.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Thank the Gods.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	In the morning, he doesn't remember.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  You've always hated him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Hated him? I worshiped him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna".
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You must be gone by then. You and your children.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I will not have their blood on my hands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Such a sad mistake.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Oh, but it was.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei walks off.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Littlefinger is looking outside his brothel window. Seeing mothers bathing their crying children.Seemingly in thought, he decides to close it. Meanwhile, Ros and Ameca are playing with each other, while Ros is loudly moaning.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  Come here.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Oh yes, oh. Oh yes yes yes.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  Yes, My Lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Well, go ahead. Slowly.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You're not fooling them. They just paid you. They know what you are.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	They know it's all just an act.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Your job is to make them forget what they know.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	That takes time. You need to Ease into it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Go ahead. Ease into it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He's winning you over in spite of yourself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You're starting to like this.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He wants to believe you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He knows he's better than other men.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Overcoming your very nature.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  Why don't you join us, My Lord?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  I'm saving myself for another.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  A stupid saying.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  She must be very beautiful.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  I do believe my lord's in love.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  For many years. Most of my life really.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Play with her ass.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And she loved me too. I was her little confidant, her plaything.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	She could tell me anything, anything at all.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	She told me about all the horses that she liked.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	A northerner with a jaw like an anvil.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	So I challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	"He's just a boy", she said. "Please don't hurt him".
s01e07	You Win or You Die	So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  Is she still married to him?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	She loves him, I'm afraid.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? He's just so...good.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that I'll never win. Not that way.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	That's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know. That's what I am.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ros:  And what do you want?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Hmm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	While Ros and Ameca are both walking out, Littlefinger watches them leave.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Back at Winterfell, Osha is walking into a stable, carrying a bale of straw. While bending over and laying down the bale of sraw, Theon Grayjoy arrives.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord, at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes. The sea would come in closer and closer.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  Where is it you come from?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  The Iron Islands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  They far away?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  And what's that?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  Lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  Why?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  I will be lord after my father.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  So you're not lord now?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  I'm not a Southerner.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what "impunent" means.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Do you want to lose that chain?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Luwin:  Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Theon Greyjoy:  I thought she was our prisoner.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Luwin:  Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Agitated as he is, Theon runs off.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Luwin:  Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  I'm used to worse than him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Luwin:  Why did you come here?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	As far South as South goes, before the long night comes.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Luwin:   Why? What are you afraid of?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Luwin:   Owls and Shadowcats and...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Luwin:   The "things" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Osha:  They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And they ain't sleeping no more.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Seeing the wall from above, we see Jon and Sam walking towards the edge.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  I miss girls.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not even talking to them. I never talked to them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Just looking at them, hearing them giggle.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Don't you miss girls?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Both Jon and Sam are looking down and see a galloping horse.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Riders. The horn. We have to blow the horn.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  Why is he alone?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  There's no rider.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	While the Wall's gate is being opened, the horse gallops inside the tunnel. Jon and Sam are rushing down, while the stable boy has caught the horse, bringing him towards Jon, Sam and Jeor Mormont.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Night Watch stable boy:  Whoa, boy, whoa.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Where's my Uncle?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Returning to Kings Landing, we see Ned and Tomard walking down a hallway. Renly running towards them calling...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  Ned! It's Robert.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	We were hunting...a boar...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Surprised yet being shocked as he is, Ned walks towards Robert's chambers. Inside Robert's room, we see Cersei, Joffrey, Barristan Selmy and Maester Pycelle are all present. Robert speaks to joffrey, whom is sitting beside him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Robert Baratheon:  I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I was never meant to be a father.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Go on. You don't want to see this.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Joffrey walks out of the room.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Robert Baratheon:  My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	It stinks. It stinks like death. Don't think I can't smell it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I paid the bastard back, Ned. I drove my knife right through his brain.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You ask them if I didn't. Ask them!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  Robert, my sweet...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Robert Baratheon:  Out, all of you!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	On Robert's demand, everyone left except for Ned. As soon as the door shuts, Ned talks to Robert.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  You damned fool.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Robert Baratheon:  Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of..." you know how it goes. Fill in the damn titles.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	"I hereby command Eddard of House Stark" titles, titles.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	"To serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	To rule in my stead, until my son Joffrey comes of age".
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Give it over.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned hands over the letter and quill. It is seen that Robert's signs the letter with his autograph.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Robert Baratheon:  Give it to the council after I'm dead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You'll rule now. You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The girl, Daenerys. You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother. Worthless.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	No one to tell me "no" but you. Only you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Let her live. Stop it, if it's not too late.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  I will.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Robert Baratheon:  And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Robert Baratheon:  My memory.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Give me something for the pain and let me die.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned walks out of Robert's chamber. Maester Pycelle, Renly, Varys and Barristan Selmy are waiting outside.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Give him milk of the poppy.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Both Maester Pycelle as Renly re-enter Robert's chamber. Still outside a conversation occurs.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Barristan Selmy:  He was reeling from the wine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He commanded us to step aside, but I failed him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  No man could have protected him from himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Lord Varys:  I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Barristan Selmy:  His squire, from the king's own skin.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  His squire? The Lannister boy?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Lord Varys:  Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Lord Varys:  I'm afraid those birds have flown.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The girl is likely dead already.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned walks off.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Entering Khal Drogo's tent, Daenerys is braiding Khal Drogo's hair. The conversation is spoken in the Dothraki language.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The dirt where I was born.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  Not dirt. Lands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  Lands, yes...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	There are thousands of ships in the free cities. Wooden horses that fly across the sea.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  It's not a chair. It's a... Throne
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  Throne?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo kisses Daenerys and walks out of the tent.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	A while later, at one of Vaes Dothrak's markets, Daenerys walks with Jorah Mormont.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  Can't you help me make him understand?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Have I said something funny, Ser?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He had no right to them. He seized them because he could.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  And because he had dragons.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  You don't believe it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	As for the rest It was 300 years ago. Who knows what really happened?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Deanerys Targarian: Well, I'll come with you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah walks by a few merchants, while a little child is calling him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Little Bird:  Psst, Jorah the Andal.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	A royal pardon. You can go home now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah seems to have a change of heart. Meanwhile a merchant is heard from afar.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Sweet reds! I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tyrosh pear brandy! Andalish sours! I have them! I have them!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Danaerys approaches the merchant
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	One taste and you'll name your first child after me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Just a taste.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  My Lady, you are from Westeros.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Doreah:  You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  Princess.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  That? Dornish swill.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor. Nectar of the Gods.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Let me give you a cask. Uh... a gift.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  You honor me, Ser.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  The honor...the honor is all mine.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Rakharo:  Huh-uh, huh-uh.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Rakharo pulls the cask out of the merchants hands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  I hope to repay your kindness someday.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Rakharo.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Rakharo:  Huh.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Put down that cask.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  Is something wrong?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  I have a thirst. Open it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Open it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The wine merchant obeys and opens the cask.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Pour.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  Do as he says.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  As the princess commands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The wine merchant poors the wine into a cup.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  You first.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Wine Merchant:  Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  You will drink.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The wine merchant takes Jorah's cup. Looks both Jorah and Daenerys innocently in their eyes, while making a toasting gesture.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	As soon as his lips touches his cup, he drops it and tries to flee.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Doreah:  Khaleesi! Stop him!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	After a very short chase, Rakharo was able to capture the wine merchant, grabbing the merchants leg with his whip.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah grabs Daenerys's arm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jorah Mormont:  Come.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	At the Wall we see Jeor Mormont speaking towards his brothers of the Night's Watch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jeor Mormont:  You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You came to us rich and you came to us poor.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	It does not matter. All that, is in the past.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Here, on the wall, are all one house.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tonight...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwel Tarly:  You're allowed to look happy.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You're going to be a Ranger.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Isn't that what you always wanted?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  I want to find my Uncle.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I know he's alive out there. I know he is.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	It's the steward's life for me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  There's honor in being a steward.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not much, really. But there's food.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jeor Mormont:  Here you begin anew.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	A man of The Night's Watch lives his life for the realm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love. But for the realm! And all the people in it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You've all learned the words of the vow.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Think carefully before you say them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The penalty for desertion, is death.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You can take your vows here tonight, at sunset.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Do any of you still keep the old Gods?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow stands.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  I do, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jeor Mormont:  You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jeor Mormont:  You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  my lord, might I go as well?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jeor Mormont:  Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  No, my lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Alliser ThorneL  Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  The Night's Watch is my house now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The Seven have never answered my prayers. Perhaps the old Gods will.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jeor Mormont:  As you wish, lad.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Halder to the builders. Pyp to the stewards. Toad to the builders.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Grenn to the Rangers. Samwell to the stewards. Matthar to the Rangers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Dareon to the stewards. Balian to the Rangers. Rast to the Rangers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon to the stewards. Rancer to the builders. Echiel to the builders.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Gordo to the stewards. Niko to the Rangers. Escan to the Rangers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables. Mink to the kitchens.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Allo to the builders. Nelugo to the Rangers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	May all the Gods preserve you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jaremy Rykker:  Rangers with me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Othell Yarwyck:  Builders!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Everyone walks to their designated leader. Sam, Jon and Pyp walk towards Maester Aemon and await their tasks.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Aemon:  Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive. Make no comment about his nose.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Aemon:  Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  Do you take me for a servant?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Aemon:  We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	But perhaps we were wrong in that.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  May I go?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Maester Aemon:  As you wish.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon walks away, while Sam and Pyp follow him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He wanted it and he got it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Stewards are nothing but maids! I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you! It's not fair.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Pypar:  Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	So now I'm here. At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I'll never see my family again. I'll never be inside a woman again.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	So don't tell me about fair.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Pypar:  You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Angrily Pyp walks off. Sam talks to Jon.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You'll be with him day and night.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Yes, you'll clean his clothes.But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You'll know everything, be part of everything. And he asked for you himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He wants to groom you for command.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon Snow:  I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  I always wanted to be a Wizard.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon laughs out loud.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	What? No, I'm serious.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	So you'll stay and say your words with me?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	In Kings Landing we see Ned Stark walking with his guards, while Renly approaches.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  Lord Stark, a moment.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Alone if you will.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  He named you Protector of the Realm.He did.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  She won't care.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  And what should I do with a hundred swords?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  What about Stannis?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Stannis is your older brother.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a King. I am.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Renly Baratheon:  Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tell me something: Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned walks off to his chamber, while Renly is left behind agitated.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Entering Ned Starks chamber, we see him writing a letter to Stannis. Giving orders to Tomard.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Only Stannis himself.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tomard:  Yes, My Lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Littlefinger enters the room
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Now leave us.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tomard follows Ned's command and leaves his chamber. Littlefingers starts off the conversation.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  My Lord protector.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  The King has no true born sons.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  So when the King dies...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  So it would seem. Unless...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  There is no "unless".
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  And he cannot take the throne without your help.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Do you have a shred of honor?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Make peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  We?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  What you suggest is treason.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  Only if we lose.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  We only make peace with our enemies, my Lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	That's why it's called "making peace".
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  No. I won't do it.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  So it will be Stannis and war?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  There is no other choice. He is the heir.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  You promised Catelyn you would help me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard. I need the gold cloaks.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Who do they follow?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The man who pays them.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Back at the Wall, we see Jon, Sam and Ghost, walking with a few Night's Watch brothers, on their way to the Weirwood tree.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Upon arrival, they're taking their vows.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Both Jon and Sam:  Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Night gathers and now my watch begins.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	It shall not end until my death.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I shall live and die at my post.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I am the sword in the darkness.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I am the watcher on the walls.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I pledge my life and honor to The Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Othell Yarwyck:  You knelt as boys.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Fellow Night's Watch brothers:  Well done. Well done.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ghost suddenly appears and is holding onto something.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  What's he got there?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Jon SnowL  To me, Ghost. Bring it here.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	It appeared that Ghost was holding a frozen hand.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Samwell Tarly:  Gods be good!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Returning to a tent in Vaes Dothrak, both Daenarys and Jorah are having a conversation, while walking past the captured wine merchant.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  What will they do to him?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  And when he falls?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I saw a man last nine miles once.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  King Robert still wants me dead.This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He will never leave you alone.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He will never abandon the hunt.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You're a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenerys Stormborn:  He will not have my son.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He will not have you either, Khaleesi.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo enters the tent with a couple of his men. After staring at the scared merchant, he walks towards Daenarys
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Daenarys gently shakes her head in disapproval. Khal Drogo kisses Daenarys's forehead and talks to Jorah.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Khal Drogo:  Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world. I will also pledge a gift.I will give him the iron chair, that his mother's father sat upon.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I will give him Seven Kingdoms. I Drogo, will do this.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends and ride wooden horses across the black salt water as no Khal has done before.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I will kill the men in iron suits and tear down their stone houses.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I will rape their women, take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	This, I vow. I, Drogo, son of Bharbo. I swear before the Mother of Mountains as the stars look down in witness!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	As the stars look down in witness!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The Khalasar is moving out of Vaes Dothrak, riding underneath the Horse Gate.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Just as Jorah predicted, the wine merchant is leashed to one of the horses saddles, covered with dirt, struggling to move on.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	In Kings Landing Ned stark walks with his men, while being called by a messenger.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Messenger:  Lord Stark!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Varly:  Stop!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  No, all right.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	It's all right. Let him through.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Messenger:  Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  King Joffrey?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Messenger:  King Robert is gone.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The Gods give him rest.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned seems petrified by the news. Shortly after, Ned arrives close-by the Throne room, where Littlefinger, Varys and a few Stark men await him.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Lord Varys:  I fear Lord Renly has left the city.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Last seen galloping South in some haste.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	When moving on, affront of the Throne room, Janos Slynt and the Gold Cloaks await Ned.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Janos Slynt:  We stand behind you, Lord Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Messenger:  All hail his Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	King Joffrey:  I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Barristan Selmy:  King Robert's seal. Unbroken.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age".
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Protector of the realm. Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark? A piece of paper?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei shreds Robert's letter to pieces
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Barristan Selmy:  Those were the King's words.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  We have a new King now.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, My Lord.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home.Your son has no claim to the throne.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	King Joffrey:  Liar!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cersei Lannister:  You think he stands alone?
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Cregor Clegane draws his sword.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	King Joffrey:  Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Janos Slynt:  Men of the Watch!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The Gold Cloaks draw their swords.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Ned Stark:  I want no bloodshed.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Tell your men to lay down their swords. No one needs to die.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  Now!
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Suddenly, the Gold Cloaks switch sides and attack the Stark men. Littlefinger sneaks up to Ned Stark.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	He grabs him from behind, then holds a dagger to his throat, saying...
s01e07	You Win or You Die	Petyr Baelish:  I did warn you not to trust me.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	You Win or You Die is the seventh episode of the HBO medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones. It was written by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Daniel Minahan. Set to air May 29, 2011, the episode was released in advance immediately following the conclusion of A Golden Crown to HBO customers with access to HBO Go.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The episode furthers the story line of deterioration of the political balance of the Seven Kingdoms, with Eddard Stark revealing what he has discovered to Cersei Lannister while King Robert is still away on a hunt. The title of the episode is part of a quote from Cersei Lannister during the final confrontation with Eddard: When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground. The catchphrase has been frequently used during the promotion of both the books and the TV series.
s01e07	You Win or You Die	The episode attracted 2.4 million viewers in its initial airing, with a total of 3.2 million including the follow-up airing. The episode was generally well received by critics for its well-acted dramatic tension, but with several criticizing the coupling of exposition and nudity as sexposition.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Entering King's Landing, we see Syrio Forel dancing with Arya.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  Yah! Left high, left low.
s01e08	The Pointy End	How ironic it seems, how peacefully Arya and Syrio are dancing, near the Throne room, the Kings Guard fights a few Stark men.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Going back again at Arya's dancing training.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  Right low, lunge right.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Outside in a courtyard, a few Stark stewards are packing and bringing out the Stark family's belongings.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Steward of House Stark:  If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is...
s01e08	The Pointy End	The stewards are being slaughtered by the Kingsguard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Going back inside the Red Keep, Sansa is walking down a hallway with her Septa.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Septa Mordane:  Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
s01e08	The Pointy End	How she could forget...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
s01e08	The Pointy End	She's with him every morning. She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
s01e08	The Pointy End	She's so clumsy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Septa Mordane:  Hush! Go back to your room.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  What is it? What's happening?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Septa Mordane:  Do as I told you. Run!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Back at Arya's training.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  This way! Left, right.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rah! Now you are dead.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  You said right, but you went left.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  And now you are a dead girl.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  Only 'cause you lied.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  My tongue lied.
s01e08	The Pointy End	My eyes shouted the truth.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You were not seeing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  I was so. I watched, but you...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Kingsguard approaches.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Meryn Trant:  Arya Stark, come with us.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Your father wants to see you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Meryn Trant:  Mind your place, dancing master.
s01e08	The Pointy End	This is no concern of yours.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  My father wouldn't send you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	As she picks up her wooden stick from the ground, she says.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maryn Trant:  Take her.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Kings guard:  Get out of my way, little man.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  I am Syrio Forel.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Kings guard:  Foreign bastard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Kings guard draws his sword. Before he can strike, Syrio hits him with his wooden stick. Knocking him out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Meryn Trant:  Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Run to your father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel fights three Kings guards at once, eventually knocking them all out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Meryn Trant:  Bloody oafs.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  Be gone now, Arya.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  Come with me. Run.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  The first sword of Braavos does not run.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Meryn Trant strikes Syrio, a short duel takes place. Eventually Meryn Trant cuts Syrio Forel's wooden sword into pieces.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  What do we say to the God of death?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  Not today.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Syrio Forel:  Go.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark runs off and hears a bunch of screams from down the hallway. She looks concerned.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  Not today. Not today.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Back on the other side of the Red Keep, Sansa runs on, but is stopped by a familiar face.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  Stay away from me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I'll tell my father. I'll...I'll tell the Queen.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sandor Clegane:  Who do you think sent me?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Back to Arya, we see that she has arrived at the slaughtered stewards. She sees her belongings lying on the ground.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  Needle.
s01e08	The Pointy End	A stable boy appears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Stable Boy:  There she is.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  What do you want?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Stable Boy:  I want you, wolf girl. Come here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Stable Boy:  She'll reward me, the Queen!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arya Stark:  Stay away!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Accidentally, she turns around sliding Needle through the stable boys belly. Her first kill is a fact.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shook as she is, she runs off.
s01e08	The Pointy End	In the dark dungeon cells of Kings Landing we see Ned Stark. He sees a little light approaches him. After a short while it is clear that it's Varys, whom is holding a torch.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  Varys.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  I promise you it isn't poisoned.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I would save the rest, if I were you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  What about my daughters?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Even my little birds cannot find her.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  And Sansa?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  Still engaged to Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though, all dead, it grieves me to say.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I do so hate the sight of blood.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  And would again, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
s01e08	The Pointy End	When you look at me do you see a hero?
s01e08	The Pointy End	What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer.
s01e08	The Pointy End	It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  The wrong brother sadly.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  Not today, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Varys is about to walk away, while being stopped by Ned one last time.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ned Stark:  Tell me something, Varys.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Who do you truly serve?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  The Realm, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Someone must.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Varys leaves the dungeons.
s01e08	The Pointy End	At Castle Black a corpses are being carried inside. Some of the Night's brothers are inspecting the two bodies.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  It's Othor, without a doubt.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Othell Yarwyck:  The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  Mmm.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Samwell Tarly:  The smell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Othell Yarwyck:  What smell?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Samwell Tarly:  There is none.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  We should burn them.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Othell Yarwyck:  Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Fire will do for them. The Wildling way.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Get them inside.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Othell Yarwyck:  You heard him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ser Alliser: Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Nights Watch brother:  Come on, move 'em out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow is summoned to Jeor Mormont's chambers. While entering the room, a conversation starts.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The King is dead.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Is there any word of my father?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  Sit.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
s01e08	The Pointy End	They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon points to the letter, as he wants to read it. Jeor Mormont hands it over. When reading the letter, Jon stands up and wants to walk away.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Your duty lies here now.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  My sisters were in King's Landing too.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon walks out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Deep inside the Red Keep, Sansa is having a conversation with Cersei.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys and Littlefinger being in their presence.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle:  King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He wouldn't. Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Send for my father. He'll tell you, the King was his friend.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We know that.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	How can I allow you to marry my son?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle:  A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
s01e08	The Pointy End	She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  No, I'm not.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I won't hatch anything.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Petyr Baelish:  The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
s01e08	The Pointy End	She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest.
s01e08	The Pointy End	What's his name?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  Robb.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Best it comes from you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  If...if I could see my father, talk to him about...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  You disappoint me, child.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We have told you of your father's treason.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  I only meant that...what will happen to him?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  That depends.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  On...on what?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  On your brother. And on you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Back at Winterfell, Robb reads the letter Sansa sent.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Treason? Sansa wrote this?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maester Luwin:  It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maester Luwin: This is a royal command, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If you should refuse to obey...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But not alone. Call the banners.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maester Luwin: All of them, My Lord?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maester Luwin: They have.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Now we see what their words are worth.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maester Luwin: Yeah.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maester Luwin walks off.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Theon Greyjoy:  Are you afraid?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  I must be.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Theon Greyjoy:  Good.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Why is that good?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Theon Greyjoy:  It means you're not stupid.
s01e08	The Pointy End	At the Eyrie, Catelyn rushes to Lysa's chambers. Upon arrival she angrily speaks.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  You've had this since dawn?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  He sent it to me, not you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner.
s01e08	The Pointy End	My son intends to declare war.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  A war? Your son against the Lannisters?
s01e08	The Pointy End	You should go to him. Teach him patience.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law!Does family mean nothing to you?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  Family means everything to me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robin Arryn:  I'm hungry.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  Hush now, darling. You just ate.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robin Arryn:  But I'm hungry!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  Soon, love, soon.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You're always welcome here, sister.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  That is what I ask.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robin walks out of the room.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  If you fear for the safety of your son...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Are you an idiot? They killed my husband.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You say they shoved your boy from a window.
s01e08	The Pointy End	These people will do anything.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  And that is why we have to stop them.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lysa Arryn:  The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Both Tyrion and Bronn are seen walking through the hills of the Vale.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bronn:  Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bronn:  I should just take your food and leave you here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Eh? What would you do then?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  Starve, most likely.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bronn:  You don't think I'd do it, do you?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But you knew that.
s01e08	The Pointy End	That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bronn:  Fair enough.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  Though I would treasure your friendship.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Remember this: Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I like living.
s01e08	The Pointy End	A while later, Tyrion and Bronn are seen near a campfire.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bronn hears noises of approaching men and tries to warn Tyrion.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bronn:  Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  Come, share our fire.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Help yourselves to our goat.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shagga:  When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
s01e08	The Pointy End	How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Take the half man.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shagga:  We have no use for a half man's promises.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
s01e08	The Pointy End	What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Are those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lannister smiths shit better steel.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shagga:  You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I will give you this.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion makes a gesture.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shagga:  What is "this"?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  The Vale of Arryn.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
s01e08	The Pointy End	In Castle Black's kitchen, Jon and Sam are preparing a meal, while Ser Alliser approaches.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ser Alliser:  Now there's a rare sight. Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon looks Alliser in his eyes. Silence occur for a few seconds. Then, suddenly Jon tries to strike Alliser, but is stopped by Pypar and Grenn.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Samwell Tarly:  Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ser Alliser:  Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ser Alliser had his fun and walks away, while Jeor Mormont saw the incident and walk towards Jon.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon obeys and walks off.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Later that night, Ghost alerts Jon. He seems to be uneasy. Jon wakes up and talks to Ghost.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon decides to get out of bed, gear up and opens the door. Ghost runs off towards Jeor Mormants room.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mounting his door.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Commander?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Stay.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ghost waits at the front door, while Jon walks in.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Hello?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Who's there?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Commander?
s01e08	The Pointy End	As soon as he walks through the door, the door shuts and the corpse of Othor attacks Jon. Jon tries to stab him with his dagger, but nothing seems to phase him. Jon pulls himself loose, draws his sword and cuts off Othor's other hand. Then Jon stabs Othor through the heart. Othor falls down. Suddenly Jeor Mormont arrives.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jeor Mormont:  Snow!?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Commander!Othor gets back on his feet, pulling out Jon's sword out of his chest. Outside of the room, Ghost goes beserk, trying to get in.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon grabs Jeor's lantern and throws it at Othor. Othor catches fire.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  Move move!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon grabs Jeor by his arm and flees inside a room, shutting the door.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Khalasar have arrived the lands of Lhazar. Dany and her company walk through the burned area.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  What did they do?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rakharo:  Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And the slavers will give us gold...and silk and steel.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah Mormont:  Gold to hire ships, Princess. Ships to sail to Westeros.
s01e08	The Pointy End	While walking a little further, Dany sees Dothraki men looting and holding Lhazareen captive.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  Jorah, make them stop.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah Mormont:  Khaleesi?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  You heard me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah Mormont:  These men have shed blood for their Khal.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Now they claim their rewards.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rakharo:  She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah Mormont:  Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  I do not have a gentle heart, Ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah and Rhakharo both obey and run off, trying to stop the Khalasar, while freeing some Lhazareen.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rhakharo:  Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni!
s01e08	The Pointy End	While Rhakharo argues with a Dothraki man, Jorah brings over a Lhazareen woman.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah Mormont:  Come.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Dothraki Man:  Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah Mormont:  What do you want done with them?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  Bring her to me. And those women there.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jorah Mormont:  You cannot claim them all, Princess.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  I can, and I will.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Leaving with a couple of Lhazareen women, Dany arrives at a covered courtyard, where Khal Drogo is having a discussion with Mago.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mago:  Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  Moon of my life. Mago says you have taken his spoils.
s01e08	The Pointy End	A daughter of a lamb men, who was his to mount. Tell me the truth of this.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day, so they cannot be mounted.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  It pleases me to keep them safe.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wifes.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Qotho:  Does the horse mate with the lamb?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  The dragons feeds on horse and lamb alike.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mago:  You are a foreigner. You do not command me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  See how fierce she grows?
s01e08	The Pointy End	That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world. Filling her with his fire.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I will hear no more.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mago spits on the ground and draws his sword.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mago:  A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
s01e08	The Pointy End	When Qotho is trying to interfere, Khal Drogo calls him back.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  Ohosa. Os.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I will not have your body burned. I will not give you that honor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mago points out his sword and pushes it to Khal Drogo's chest.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo grins, it doesn't seem to phase him. He continues talking.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mago starts swinging his sword, while Khal Drogo dodges his attack.
s01e08	The Pointy End	When turning his back on Mago, he grabs his daggers and speaks.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo turns around facing Mago and drops his daggers to the ground.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  Until nothing is left of you but bones!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo runs towards Mago, while dodging his attacks. While attacking, Mago screams.
s01e08	The Pointy End	mago:  First you have to kill me!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal drogo grabs Mago's sword, disarms him and cuts his throat open. He grabs Mago's throat, crushes it and pulls out his tongue.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He shows Mago's tongue to the crowd, walks back to his chair and throws Mago's tongue on a pile of rotting flesh.
s01e08	The Pointy End	While sitting down, Dany runs towards him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  My sun and stars is wounded.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  A scratch, moon of my life.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  Where are the healers?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo:  This is the bite of a fly.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mirri Maz Duur:  I can help the great rider with his cut.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Qotho:  The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  She is mine let her speak.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mirri Maz Duur:  Thank you, silver lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  Who are you?
s01e08	The Pointy End	When "the witch" is trying to approach Dany, Qotho stops her.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mirri Maz Duur:  I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I was the Godswife of this Temple.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Qotho:  A witch.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And spits on the ground.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mirri Maz Duur:  My mother was Godswife here before me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
s01e08	The Pointy End	All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Qotho slaps "the witch" and says.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Qotho:  Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Mirri Maz Duur:  lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Daenarys Stormborn:  Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars.
s01e08	The Pointy End	It makes me hurt to see you bleed.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Khal Drogo lays eyes upon "the witch". While he's seemingly in thought, "the witch" approaches him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	As Dany steps aside, she looks at Khal Drogo's wound.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Entering Winterfell, gathered Stark banner men are having a feast.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We see Greatjon Umber whom is having a conversation with Robb Stark.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  Oathbreaker, is it?!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon stands up as he is offended
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
s01e08	The Pointy End	While Greatjon Umber raises his voice to Robb, Grey Wind rushes towards him and attacks, biting off 2 of his fingers.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  Your meat...is bloody tough.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber starts laughing breaking the tension, making everyone laughing along with him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Later that night, Robb is having a short visit with Brann Stark. Upon entering his room, Brann is stil asleep.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb wakes him and a conversation follows.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  What is it? What's happened?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Shh, it's all right.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  Where are you going?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  South. For father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  But it's the middle of the night.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I don't want them to know we're coming.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  They have more men than we do.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Aye, they do.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And I won't get in the way, I...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Until I return that will be you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Do you understand?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  I will.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Until I return.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb leaves the room, but as soon as Robb left, Rickon appears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  How long have you been hiding out there?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb will be looking for you, to say goodbye.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rickon Stark:  They've all gone away.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  They'll be back soon.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rickon Stark:  No, they won't.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rickon turns arond and leaves the room.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The next morning, Brann is sitting affront of the Weirwood tree.
s01e08	The Pointy End	While saying his prayers, Osha approaches him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  Please watch over Robb.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And Theon too, I suppose.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Osha:  You hear them, boy? The Old Gods are answering you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  What are you doing here?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Osha:  They're my Gods too.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Even slaves are allowed to pray.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  You're not a slave.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Osha points out to her chains and wiggles her foot.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Osha:  You asked them, they're answering you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shh. Open your ears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann is trying to listen and looks up the Weirwood tree. He hears the wind blowing through the leaves.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  It's only the wind.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
s01e08	The Pointy End	They see you, boy. They hear you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Old Gods have no power in the South.
s01e08	The Pointy End	The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
s01e08	The Pointy End	How can they watch when they have no eyes?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Suddenly Hodor appears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	It appears he was bathing nearby, since he is bare naked holding a towel around his neck.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Osha:  Well, there's a big man.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He has giants blood in him or I'm the Queen.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Go dress.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Hodor:  Hodor.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Hodor obeys and runs off.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Brann Stark:  Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Osha:  Giants and worse than giants.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	North, not south!
s01e08	The Pointy End	The cold winds are rising.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Looking back up to the Weirwood tree, Brann hears the wind again.
s01e08	The Pointy End	At castle Black, the Night's Watch decided to burn the corpse of Othor, whom attacked Jeor Mormant.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sam decided to share some knowledge.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Samwell Tarly:  They were touched by White Walkers.
s01e08	The Pointy End	That's why they came back.
s01e08	The Pointy End	That's why their eyes turned blue.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Only fire will stop them.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  How do you know that?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Samwell Tarly:  I read about it in a book. A very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jon Snow:  What else did the book say?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Samwell Tarly:  The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And when they wake up...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Pypar:  And when they wake up, what?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sam looks to the top of the Wall.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Samwell Tarly:  I hope The Wall is high enough.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Seemingly worried, the rest of the lot also look towards the top of the Wall.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik both arrive at Robb Starks camp.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rodrik Cassel:  Summer snows, My Lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  Robb's brought the North with him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Entering Robbs tent, we see Robb and his banner men discussing tactics.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts ten times this large.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Mother!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  You look well.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Theon Greyjoy:  We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  I had not thought to be here.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  You heard her! Move your asses! Come on, out.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You too, Greyjoy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Are you bloody deaf? Have no fear, My Lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You old devil, Rodrik.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rodrik Cassel:  Jon.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  You're not wasting away, are you?
s01e08	The Pointy End	As soon as the men left, Catelyn hugs Robb.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And now I find you leading a host to war.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  There was no one else.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  No one? Who were those men I saw here?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  None of them are Starks.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  All of them are seasoned in battle.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  Oh, would that I could.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  There was a letter. From Sansa.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  From the Queen, you mean.
s01e08	The Pointy End	There's no mention of Arya.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  No.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  How many men do you have?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  you would never be allowed to leave. No.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Our best hope, our only hope, is that you can defeat them in the field.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  And if I lose?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children, when the Mad King fell?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  They were butchered in their sleep.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Well, that makes it simple then.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  I suppose it does.
s01e08	The Pointy End	----------------------------------------------------
s01e08	The Pointy End	Arriving at the foot of the Lannister camp, Tyrion, Bronn, Shagga and the hill tribe, decide to stop for a short while.
s01e08	The Pointy End	A conversation follows.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shagga:  Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	If the half man betrays us, Shagga son of Dolf will cut off his manhood...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  And feed it to the goats, yes.
s01e08	The Pointy End	All right then. Time to meet my father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Moving into the Lannister camp, Shagga and the hill tribe follow.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Upon entering the Tywin Lannister's tent, we see Kevan Lannister and Tywin sitting at a table, scheming.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Kevan Lannister  Tyrion.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  Uncle. Father.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  Sorry to disappoint you.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  And who are these Companions of yours?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
s01e08	The Pointy End	This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And here we have Bronn son of...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Bronn:  You wouldn't know him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West. Kind of you to go to war for me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  We have our differences, Jaime and I.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He's braver. I'm better looking.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Jamie Lannister:  He's been covering himself in glory.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Kevan Lannister:  Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  Is our hostage.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  Robert Baratheon is dead.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  My sister rules, you mean.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Kevan Lannister:  Stark's son has called his banners.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He moves south with a strong host.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  A green boy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tyrion Lannister:  Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You'd like him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Suddenly a messenger appears, interrupting Tyrion's request.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Messenger:  If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
s01e08	The Pointy End	So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Kevan Lannister:  At once, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin Lannister:  It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Shagga:  Only if the half man fights with us.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Tywin looks over to Tyrion. Tyrion looks shooked.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Back at Robbs camp, inside his tent we see Robb and his men plotting.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rodrik Cassal:  The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Do that and the River Lords will join us.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Theon Greyjoy:  Lord Frey controls that bridge.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Your father's bannerman.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  "The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Meanwhile, outside a few Stark men captured a scout, leading him to Robbs tent.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Theon Greyjoy:  Robb's right.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We need that bridge.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Stark guard:  Your pardon, my lords.
s01e08	The Pointy End	We've captured a Lannister scout.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Theon covers the map with pawns
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  Don't worry, lad.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Where did you find him?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Stark guard:  In the brush above the encampment.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He looked to be counting.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb walks towards the Lannister scout.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  How high did you get?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lannister scout:  20,000. Maybe more.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Rodrik Cassel  You don't have to do this yourself.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Your father would understand.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And he understands honor and courage.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Let him go.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Catelyn Stark:  Robb.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb looks over his shoulder with a stare. Catelyn understands and looks down in regret.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	To find out if he really does shit gold.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lannister scout:  Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  You call me boy again.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber wants to taunt Robb.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Robb Stark:  Go on.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Greatjon Umber:  Oi.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Frustrated, Greatjon Umber walks out of the tent.
s01e08	The Pointy End	In Kings Landing, we see Ned Stark asleep in the dungeons, a guard on patrol kicks his feet waking him up. Then walks on.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Meanwhile, in the Throne room, new roles are being announced by Grand Maester Pycelle.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle:  It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch...
s01e08	The Pointy End	While Grand Maester Pycelle is speaking, Sansa walks by a few familiar faces.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  Ser Aron.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle:  Be at once raised to the rank of Lord.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  Lord Gyles.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle:  And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time.
s01e08	The Pointy End	In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Ser Barristan Selmy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Barristan Selmy approaches.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Barristan Selmy:  Your Grace, I am yours to command.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Rise, Ser Barristan.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You may remove your helm.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
s01e08	The Pointy End	It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Barristan Selmy:  Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Our vows are taken for life. Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?
s01e08	The Pointy End	King Joffrey:  You let my father die.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You're too old to protect anybody.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Barristan Selmy:  Your Grace...
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Barristan Selmy:  The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Careful, Ser.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Barristan Selmy:  A hall to die in and men to bury me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I am a Knight. I shall die a Knight.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Petyr Baelish:  A naked Knight, apparently.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Barristan Selmy:  Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
s01e08	The Pointy End	Here, boy! Melt it down and add it to the others.
s01e08	The Pointy End	King's Landing Page:  If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  Your Grace.
s01e08	The Pointy End	King Joffrey:  Come forward, My Lady.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa walk forth.
s01e08	The Pointy End	King's Landing Page:  The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Cersei Lannister:  Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  I do.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa kneels down.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle:  Treason is a noxious weed.
s01e08	The Pointy End	It should be torn out, root...
s01e08	The Pointy End	King Joffrey:  Let her speak.
s01e08	The Pointy End	I want to hear what she says.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  Thank you, Your Grace.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Petyr Baelish:  Do you deny your father's crime?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.
s01e08	The Pointy End	All I ask is mercy. I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	You all know he loved him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	They must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
s01e08	The Pointy End	They must have lied!
s01e08	The Pointy End	King Joffrey:  He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  He was badly hurt.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He wasn't himself. Otherwise h never would have said it.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Lord Varys:  A child's faith Such sweet innocence.
s01e08	The Pointy End	And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Grand Maester Pycelle:  Treason is treason!
s01e08	The Pointy End	King Joffrey:  Anything else?
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
s01e08	The Pointy End	King Joffrey:  Your sweet words have moved me.
s01e08	The Pointy End	But your father has to confess.
s01e08	The Pointy End	He has to confess and say that I'm the King or there'll be no mercy for him.
s01e08	The Pointy End	Sansa Stark:  He will.
s01e08	The Pointy End	They don’t actually say the words in this episode, it’s a reference to Jon’s instructions to Arya from S01E02 “The Kingsroad”. The specifc line can be found just below these lines. This moment is also referenced in S01E03 “Lord Snow” when Arya repeats the line to her father. The exact line is found just below these lines.
s01e09	Baelor	At the King’s Landing catacombs, Varys goes out to see Ned Stark.
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  You've seen better days, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  Robb? He's just a boy.
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddard Stark:  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
s01e09	Baelor	Varys:  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?
s01e09	Baelor	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
s01e09	Baelor	Theon shoots a raven coming from The Twins. Robb picks it up and reads the message.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
s01e09	Baelor	Theon Greyjoy:  Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
s01e09	Baelor	Greatjon Umber:  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
s01e09	Baelor	Theon Greyjoy:  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
s01e09	Baelor	Greatjon Umber:  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  Have my horse saddled and ready.
s01e09	Baelor	Greatjon Umber:  Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
s01e09	Baelor	Theon Greyjoy:  Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  l agree. l'll go.
s01e09	Baelor	Everyone:  You can't!
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
s01e09	Baelor	Greatjon Umber:  Unless there was a profit in it.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn finds herself inside the Twins, which the Freys gathered to watch her audience with Lord Walder.
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  What do you want?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?
s01e09	Baelor	Stevron Frey:  Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?
s01e09	Baelor	Ryger Rivers:  Father, please –
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.
s01e09	Baelor	(gestures to Catelyn) All right, you come forward.
s01e09	Baelor	(kisses her hand) There. Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  ls there somewhere we can talk?
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
s01e09	Baelor	(taps his new wife on the bottom) Oh! You too.
s01e09	Baelor	(To Catelyn) You see that? Fifteen, she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure she will give you many sons.
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  He is quite ill, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  My lord, l –
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure there were reasons –
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Why should l let him?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  You swore an oath to my father.
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  Why don't you?
s01e09	Baelor	Walder Frey:  Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?
s01e09	Baelor	--------------------------------
s01e09	Baelor	At Castle Black, Jon Snow and Commander Mormont are having a chat.
s01e09	Baelor	Voices outside:  And engage!
s01e09	Baelor	Jeor Mormont:  When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  Soon, he says.
s01e09	Baelor	Jeor Mormont:  Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  This is Valyrian steel.
s01e09	Baelor	Jeor Mormont:  lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  My lord, you honor me, but l can't –
s01e09	Baelor	Jeor Mormont:  Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	Jeor Mormont:  Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
s01e09	Baelor	Jeor Mormont:  No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow leaves the room and emerges outside, heading towards the mess hall.
s01e09	Baelor	Unidentified Night’s Watchers:  Well done. Well done.
s01e09	Baelor	Night’s Watcher #1:  You earned that, Snow.
s01e09	Baelor	Night’s Watcher #2:  Well done.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon arrives at the mess hall. The other men gather around him to see his new sword, but Sam remains seated at a distance, looking distraught.
s01e09	Baelor	Pyp:  Go on, let's have a look.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  At what?
s01e09	Baelor	Grenn:  The sword! Show us the sword.
s01e09	Baelor	All:  Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
s01e09	Baelor	Pyp:  Let's have a look.
s01e09	Baelor	Grenn:  Piss off.
s01e09	Baelor	Pyp:  Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!
s01e09	Baelor	Grenn:  Look at its eyes.
s01e09	Baelor	While the others are playing with the sword, Jon gets seated beside Sam.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  What is it?
s01e09	Baelor	Samwell Tarly:  l - l can't.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  You can't what?
s01e09	Baelor	Samwell Tarly:  l'm really not supposed to say.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
s01e09	Baelor	Samwell Tarly:  There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  What? What about him?
s01e09	Baelor	Samwell Tarly:  He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  l should be there. l should be with him.
s01e09	Baelor	--------------------------
s01e09	Baelor	Back at the Crossing, Catelyn returns from her conversation with Walder Frey at the Twins, and finds Robb and the others having a meeting in his tent.
s01e09	Baelor	Greatjon Umber:  lf we do that, they'll never get back across.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  Well? What did he say?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  Huh.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  What does he want in return?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:   Fine, fine. And?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  She won't be happy about that. And?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  l did.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  And?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  One was – Do you consent?
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  Can l refuse?
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  Not if you want to cross.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  Then l consent.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb leaves the meeting right away. Theon laughs while Catelyn watches.
s01e09	Baelor	We cut to a shot of Robb’s men on the other side of the river, having already crossed the Green Fork of the Trident and heading south.
s01e09	Baelor	--------------
s01e09	Baelor	Back at Castle Black. Jon goes to see Maester Aemon, finding him cutting meat to serve to the ravens.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  Sam said you wanted to see me?
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  No.
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  He would do whatever was right, no matter what.
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  Sam told you.
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South: the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  Who are you?
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.
s01e09	Baelor	Jon Snow:  You're Aemon Targaryen.
s01e09	Baelor	Maester Aemon:  l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.
s01e09	Baelor	------------------------------
s01e09	Baelor	Across the Narrow Sea, the Dothraki are on the move. Drogo leads them, but seems to have fainted. Daenerys rides right behind him.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
s01e09	Baelor	Drogo falls off his horse.
s01e09	Baelor	Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) My horse…
s01e09	Baelor	Cohollo:  (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood…
s01e09	Baelor	Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) No, l must ride.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!
s01e09	Baelor	---------------------
s01e09	Baelor	At the Lannister camp, Tywin is presiding over lunch/war meeting. Tyrion gets there while everyone’s already seated and eating.
s01e09	Baelor	Kevan Lannister:  Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
s01e09	Baelor	Kevan Lannister:  The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Shagga likes axes.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
s01e09	Baelor	Kevan Lannister:  They do seem rather ferocious.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.
s01e09	Baelor	Back at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman (a prostitute) waiting there too.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  l took her.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Took her? From whom?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  And he didn't have anything to say about it?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  He said something.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn leaves. Tyrion addresses the prostitute.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Who are you?
s01e09	Baelor	Prostitute:  Who would you like me to be?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  What did your mother call you?
s01e09	Baelor	Prostitute:  Shae. What did your mother call you?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  My mother died giving birth to me.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  What sort of accent is that?
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Foreign.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  For-
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  What do you want from me?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  And what do l get?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Who told you this? Women you paid?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
s01e09	Baelor	Shae gets undressed and kisses Tyrion.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Let's start with your last night in this world.
s01e09	Baelor	------------------------------
s01e09	Baelor	Back across the Narrow Sea. Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki (no subtitles provided) inside a tent, Daenerys by his side.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont: Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah removes an herbal treatment from Drogo’s wound, revealing it has become infected.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  He's already gone, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur enters the tent, and bows to Daenerys. Qotho comes to check on Drogo too, with a few other bloodriders at the entrance.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  The wound has festered.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) You did this, witch. (pulls a dagger out of its sheath)
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho and the other Dothraki leave.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  l think you're right.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah leaves the tent.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  You've saved me once more.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  And now you must save him.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  Do it. Save him.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a price.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:   You'll have gold, whatever you want.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  My death?
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys signals to Irri, who leaves to find the horse. We cut to the horse being taken by a rope into to the tent.
s01e09	Baelor	Rakharo:  Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:   Kill her and you kill your khal.
s01e09	Baelor	Rakharo:  This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur starts an incantation
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  Go. Now.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  Take her and leave. Take her!
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur:  You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys caresses Drogo’s forehand as she moves to leave.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  No one will enter.
s01e09	Baelor	Mirri Maz Duur slits the horse’s throat. Blood spills all over Drogo’s chest and Daenerys’ face.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  Bring him back to me.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys leaves the tent as the horse collapses to the ground, dead. Jorah comes to her.
s01e09	Baelor	What have you done?
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  l have to save him.
s01e09	Baelor	We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This must not be.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) This must be.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Witch.
s01e09	Baelor	Rakharo:  (in Dothraki) Nothing good will come of this.
s01e09	Baelor	Rakharo tries to talk to Qotho, but gets sucker punched in the face.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) No, you can't.
s01e09	Baelor	Qotho unsheaths his dagger and moves past Daenerys, pushing her towards the ground. Daenerys hits the ground with her belly.
s01e09	Baelor	Irri:  Khaleesi!
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) No further, horselord.
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys starts moaning in pain, while we hear Mirri Maz Duur’s incantations in the background. Qotho turns around and lunges towards Jorah. The two fight, but Jorah gains the upper hand and kills him with a sword blow to the face.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  Are you hurt?
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen: The baby –
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  Hmm?
s01e09	Baelor	Daenerys Targaryen: … is coming.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  Fetch the midwives.
s01e09	Baelor	Rakharo:  They will not come. They say she is cursed.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah Mormont:  They'll come or l'll have their heads.
s01e09	Baelor	Rakharo:  The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
s01e09	Baelor	Jorah moves inside the tent with Daenerys in his arms, as screams and incantations from the inside start getting louder and louder in tone.
s01e09	Baelor	-----------------------
s01e09	Baelor	At the Lannister camp, Tyrion, Bronn and Shae are drinking together inside Tyrion’s tent at night, before the battle.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Are you in agony, my lion?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  No.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Just used to it.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:   Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Let's play a new game.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  Not if you win.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  What are you good at?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  l happen to be a great judge of character.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  This sounds like a boring game.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  l don't want to play this game.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn drinks.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  But my mother hit harder.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  You killed your first man before you were 12.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  You've been north of the Wall.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  What brought you up there?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  Work.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  l don't want to play.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion drinks.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  And we've established the rules about lying?
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Drink!
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion drinks.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Drink.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Are you sure –
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  My turn.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Who were you in love with?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  That's not how the game works.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  l don't care the way the game works.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  Our lord here used to be married.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Married?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  How did you hear that?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Another night, perhaps.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Not another night. This night.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  lt's not a pleasant story.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  Oh, maybe l will cry.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  For three chickens, l should hope so.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  l would have killed the man who did that to me.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  You should have known she was a whore.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  As l said, l was young and stupid.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  You are still young and stupid.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae starts kissing Tyrion, causing Bronn to leave the tent. The next day, the Lannisters ride to battle; Bronn returns to Tyrion’s tent to wake him and Shae up.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  What is it? What do you want?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  You're sleeping through the war.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  What?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Get my squire!
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  You don't have a squire.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  lf l die, weep for me.
s01e09	Baelor	Shae:  You'll be dead. How will you know?
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  l'll know.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion leaves the tent, fully armoured.
s01e09	Baelor	Lannister soldier : Watch out! Move!
s01e09	Baelor	Lannister soldier : Out of the way! Move aside!
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  Stay low.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Stay low?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!
s01e09	Baelor	Tribesmen of the Vale (chanting): Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  To battle!
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion rides to battle with the rest, but turns around quickly after and is hit with a mace from one of the Tribesmen. He passes out. Later, we cut to the end of the battle – dead bodies and swords piling on the ground. Tyrion wakes up to find Bronn talking to him as he’s carried on a wheelbarrow.
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  You're a shit warrior.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  l'm alive?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  You're alive.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Did we win?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  How did our tribesmen do?
s01e09	Baelor	Bronn:  Yeah, good.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  lt's nice to see them getting along.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin shows up next to them, fully armoured and on horseback.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  You're wounded.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  He wasn't here.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  Where was he?
s01e09	Baelor	Tywin Lannister:  With his other 18,000 men.
s01e09	Baelor	Tyrion Lannister:  And where are they?
s01e09	Baelor	--------------
s01e09	Baelor	We cut to Catelyn and Rodrik Cassel overlooking the Trident from a safe distance at higher ground.
s01e09	Baelor	Rodrik Cassel:  We should go, my lady.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  No!
s01e09	Baelor	Rodrik Cassel:  My lady!
s01e09	Baelor	Stark bannermen:  Hyah! Hyah!
s01e09	Baelor	The Stark host arrives at the clearing. Robb is amongst them, and he comes carrying a tied and bound Jaime Lannister.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
s01e09	Baelor	Jaime Lannister:  Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
s01e09	Baelor	Jaime Lannister:  l've lost them too, l'm afraid.
s01e09	Baelor	Theon Greyjoy:  Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  He's more use to us alive than dead.
s01e09	Baelor	Catelyn Stark:  Take him away and put him in irons.
s01e09	Baelor	Jaime Lannister:  We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.
s01e09	Baelor	Greatjon Umber:  Come on, pretty man.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
s01e09	Baelor	Theon Greyjoy:  The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
s01e09	Baelor	Robb Stark:  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
s01e09	Baelor	-----------------------
s01e09	Baelor	At King’s Landing, Arya is chasing down pigeons on the street while staying hidden from the Kingsguard. She catches one and snaps its neck. Soon afterwards, she sees a baker’s stall with pastries on display.
s01e09	Baelor	Arya Stark:  Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
s01e09	Baelor	King’s Landing Baker:  Three coppers.
s01e09	Baelor	Arya Stark:  How about a nice fat pigeon?
s01e09	Baelor	King’s Landing Baker:  Oh, piss off now. Go on.
s01e09	Baelor	Arya Stark:  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
s01e09	Baelor	King’s Landing Baker:  Piss off!
s01e09	Baelor	Everyone starts walking up the street, leaving Arya confused. Two street urchins run past her up the stairs.
s01e09	Baelor	Arya Stark:  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
s01e09	Baelor	Street Urchin:  They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
s01e09	Baelor	Arya Stark:  Who?
s01e09	Baelor	Street Urchin:  The Hand of the King.
s01e09	Baelor	Arya follows the crowd to the Sept of Baelor. She climbs up the pedestal of Baelor’s statue to get a better view of her surroundings. We cut to Ned Stark being taken from the sept and into the courtyard, in full view of the gathered populace; Baelor’s statue is seen on the background to his left. Ned catches Arya’s eye at the foot of the statue.
s01e09	Baelor	Populace:  Traitor! Coward!
s01e09	Baelor	Ned is taken across the populace and runs into Yoren of the Night’s Watch.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddark Stark:  Baelor!
s01e09	Baelor	Yoren looks towards the statue knowingly.
s01e09	Baelor	Populace:  Traitor! Traitor!
s01e09	Baelor	Ned is taken to a raised platform where Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger are standing. Sansa smiles warmly at her father as he addresses the crowd.
s01e09	Baelor	Eddark Stark:  I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s01e09	Baelor	Grand Maester Pycelle:  As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
s01e09	Baelor	Joffrey Baratheon:  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
s01e09	Baelor	The townsfolk roar with approval; Arya leaves the pedestal and runs towards the commotion. Sansa gets visibly distraught and starts yelling as a member of the Kingsguard holds her back.
s01e09	Baelor	Sansa Stark:  No, stop! Please, someone stop him!
s01e09	Baelor	Cersei Baratheon: My son, this is madness.
s01e09	Baelor	Populace: Put him down!
s01e09	Baelor	Varys runs to the platform to talk to Cersei and Joffrey, Ilyn Payne puts on his executioner’s mask. Arya marches towards the courtyard but is grabbed by the arm by Yoren.
s01e09	Baelor	Yoren: Don't look!
s01e09	Baelor	Arya Stark:  Let me go.
s01e09	Baelor	Yoren:  Shut your mouth. Look at me.
s01e09	Baelor	Sansa Stark:  Stop him, stop!
s01e09	Baelor	From Ned’s perspective, the roars of the crowd become almost silent; he looks towards Baelor’s statue but finds no one there. He lowers his head in recognition of his fate as the sound of Payne’s longsword cuts through the hushed silence. We see the sword swing until it reaches his head, with a direct cut to Arya as Yoren prevents her from seeing the actual execution. Arya looks at the sky; a flock of pigeons flies away from the courtyard as she holds her head against Yoren’s chest; she sighs heavily, and the screen cuts to black.
s01e09	Baelor	Ned makes a fateful decision. Catelyn brokers an unsavory deal with Walder Frey.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	We begin where “Baelor” left off; after the execution of Ned Stark, we see Ilyn Payne’s bloodied sword and the Hound picking up Ned’s head to show it to the rapturous townsfolk. We then pan to Arya, her eyes closed and her face pressed against Yoren’s chest.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Yoren:  Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Yoren takes Arya with him away from the mob and into a flight of stairs; on the courtyard, Sansa faints.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Yoren:  Keep your mouth shut, boy. (takes out a knife)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Arya Stark:  l'm not a boy!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Yoren:  You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! (starts cutting Arya’s hair as the screams and shouts from the crowd are heard above) North, boy, we're going north.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	------------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	At Winterfell, Bran has a dream in which he can walk and sees a three-eyed raven. He then talks about this dream with Osha.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Osha:  Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Osha:  l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Osha takes Bran to the crypts. She carries him with her arms while he lights the way with a torch.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Osha:  You see? He's not here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	A loud roar is heard and a shadow moves in front of them. A direwolf runs towards them; Osha falls to the ground with him. We see Shaggydog barking at them viciously.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rickon Stark:  Here, Shaggydog.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  Rickon!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Osha:  That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rickon Stark:  He doesn't like chains.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rickon Stark:  No, l came to see Father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rickon Stark:  He was down here. l saw him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Bran Stark:  Saw him when?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rickon Stark:  Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rickon leaves with Shaggydog, while Osha looks puzzled at Bran. We cut to a shot of her carrying him outside.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Osha:  You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that –
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Maester Luwin:  Bran…
s01e10	Fire and Blood	--------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark walks alone through the Stark camp. Several bannermen bow to her respectfully as she passes.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Several Stark Bannermen:  My lady. My lady. My lady.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	She reaches a small forest outside camp and collapses in grief by one of the trees, crying and sobbing. She hears some screams and the sound of a sword slashing wood nearby. As she gets closer, she realizes it’s Robb, fully armoured, slashing his sword against a tree while crying.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Robb drops his sword to the ground and goes to Catelyn. She hugs him and caresses his neck, trying to console him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  Shh! Shh! Shh!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Robb Stark:  l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	-------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	At the Throne Room on the Red Keep, Marillion the bard is singing a song for Joffrey and his retinue. Cercei stands by his side, while Sansa overlooks the scene from one of the colonnades.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  (singing)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	The boar's great tusks, they boded ill
s01e10	Fire and Blood	For good King Robert's health
s01e10	Fire and Blood	And the beast was every bit as fat
s01e10	Fire and Blood	As Robert was himself
s01e10	Fire and Blood	But our brave king cried,
s01e10	Fire and Blood	"Do your worst!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	l'll have your ugly head!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	You're nowhere near as murd'rous as
s01e10	Fire and Blood	the lion in my bed"
s01e10	Fire and Blood	King Robert lost his battle and
s01e10	Fire and Blood	He failed his final test,
s01e10	Fire and Blood	The lion ripped his balls off,
s01e10	Fire and Blood	And the boar did all the rest.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  Your Grace?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa looks at Joffrey, despondent.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Good. Tongue it is.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  l beg you! Please, no. No!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Ilyn Payne marches towards the fire to heat up his dagger.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! (screaming) No!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  l'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  (screaming) Your Grace, please!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	As Joffrey leaves with Meryn Trant and the Hound, he passes by Sansa. Marillion is still screaming and begging in the background.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  You look quite nice.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa Stark:  Thank you, my lord.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Your Grace. l'm King now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Marillion:  (screaming) Stop! No!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Walk with me. l want to show you something.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sandor Clegane:  Do as you're bid, child.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey and Sansa are outside, walking past across a row of spears in the Red Keep. Trant and Clegane follow behind them.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	The pikes have impaled heads on them. Sansa looks away.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa Stark:  No! Please, no!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  (pointing at one of the heads) This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa Stark:  You promised to be merciful.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa Stark:  Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa looks up at the head of her father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Well?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa Stark:  How long do l have to look?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa Stark:  lf it please Your Grace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  That's your Septa there. (shot of the impaled head of a woman with the traditional Septa headscarf) l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa Stark:  Or maybe he'll give me yours. (looks defiantly at Joffrey, who cowers)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his (armoured) hand, leaving her lip bloodied. Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below. She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she’s stopped by the Hound.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sandor Clegane:  Here, girl. (cleans her bloody lip with a rag)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sandor Clegane:  Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sansa tries to give him is handkerchief back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sandor Clegane:  You'll be needing that again.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sandor leaves, leaving Sansa alone at the bridge. She looks at the heads atop the pikes and cries.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	--------------------------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	War meeting at the Stark camp. They sit at the table at night by torchlight.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jonos Bracken:  The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Robb Stark:  Renly is not the king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jonos Bracken:  You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Robb Stark:  That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jonos Bracken:  Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Galbart Glover:  Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Greatjon Umber:  My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North! (The Greatjon bows to Robb with his sword unsheathed; Robb rises)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rickard Karstark:  l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. (bows to Robb and extends him his sword) The King in the North!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Theon Greyjoy:  Am l your brother, now and always?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Robb Stark:  Now and always.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Theon Greyjoy:  (takes out his sword, bows to Robb) My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Greatjon Umber:  The King in the North!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	All:  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	They all take out their swords and swear fealty to Robb as Catelyn looks wearily at the whole scene.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	All:  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn goes to the outskirts of their camp, to the dungeons where prisoners are being kept.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Stark Guard:  Lady Stark.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	They walk for a while until they reach a single prisoner (Jaime), kept away far from the rest.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  Leave us. (the guards leave)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. (Catelyn grabs a large rock from the ground)  Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. (She marches towards him and hits the rock against his forehead)   Oh, l do like a violent woman.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  Because of men like you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  There are no men like me. Only me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  l pushed him out the window.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  Why?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  I hoped the fall would kill him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Catelyn Stark:  Why?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jaime Lannister:  You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. (Catelyn drops the rock and goes away)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	-----------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Cersei and Lancel are having one of their rendezvous on her bedchamber. Cersei is reading a message while Lancel speaks, naked.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Lancel Lannister:  l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Cersei Lannister:  Stop talking. Get back into bed.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	-----------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Back in the Riverlands, we sit with the Lannister war meeting. Tywin, Tyrion and Kevan are in assistance.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tywin Lannister:  They have my son.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Leo Lefford:  l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Addam Marbrand:  ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Kevan Lannister:  Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Kevan Lannister:  l'm told we still have his sisters.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Leo Lefford:  The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Addam Marbrand: Kevan Lannister:  First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise –
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tywin Lannister:  (shouting)  They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong. 
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tywin Lannister:  No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  And do what?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tywin Lannister:  Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tywin Lannister:  You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	-------------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is sleeping inside a yurt. Jorah is sitting beside her when she wakes up.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  Gently, gently.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  The boy did not live.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  Tell me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  What is there to tell?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  How did my son die?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  He never lived, my princess. The women say –
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  What do the women say?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  They say the child was –
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  (entering the tent) Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  Time enough for that later –
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  l want to see him now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	They leave the tent/yurt, following Mirri Maz Duur to the place where Drogo is lying.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  The khalasar is gone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  Drogo! (in Dothraki) My sun and stars. (in the Common Tongue, to the rest) Why is he out here alone?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  (looking at Drogo’s catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  Leave us.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys and Mirri Maz Duur have a conversation alone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  This is not God's work. My child was innocent.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  l spoke for you. l saved you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  Your life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	At Castle Black, Jon is preparing to leave in the night and desert the Night’s Watch; Sam is there to try to talk him out of it.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  You can't!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  Get out of my way, Sam.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  Better than you do.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  What are you going to do?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. (gets on horseback)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  You can't leave us now. We need you here.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  Move.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  l won't let you go.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  Move.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  No.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  Hyah!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon rides his horse away from Castle Black, his horse kicking Sam to the ground as he was standing in the way. Ghost follows him out.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	---------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	In the Lannister camp in the Riverlands, Tyrion and Shae are talking inside his tent about his recent appointment.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Shae:  Hand of the King?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  So it would seem.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Shae:  And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  No, he said l couldn't take  you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Shae:  He knew my name?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  What?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Shae:  He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  l believe he used the word "whore".
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Shae:  Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion laughs.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Shae:  I’m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Tyrion Lannister:  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – (Shae kisses Tyrion)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Shae:  l know what a Hand needs.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon and Ghost are being chased by his fellow Night’s Watch brothers through a forest not long after he left.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  Ghost?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sam, Pyp, and Grenn:  Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	During the chase, Sam hits his head on a tree branch and falls off his horse. The others and later Jon stop to assist him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grenn:  Samwell!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Pyp:  ls he dead?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grenn:  No, he's not dead.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  Did we get him?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grenn:  Come on, help me get him up.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Pyp:  Lucky you've got plenty of padding. (to Jon)  We're taking you back to where you belong.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  l belong with my brother.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:   But we're your brothers now.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grenn:  They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Pyp:  Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grenn:  But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  l have to.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grenn:  You can't. You said the words.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  I don't care about –
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Samwell Tarly:  "Hear my words and bear witness to my vow"
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  To hell with all of you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Pyp:  "Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grenn:  "l am the sword in the darkness – "
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sam, Pyp, and Grenn:  (in unison, reciting the vow) "l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Sam brings Longclaw to Jon, who accepts it.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	------------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is tending to Drogo and his wounds inside a yurt.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	We cut to Daenerys standing with her head pressing against Drogo’s chest, now visibly more distressed.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  (crying)  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys kisses Drogo, then uses a pillow to smother him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	------------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	In King’s Landing, Pycelle is having a conversation with someone (unseen at first) in his bedchambers.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grand Maester Pycelle:  Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Ros gets dressed while Pycelle keeps talking.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grand Maester Pycelle:   He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Ros is listening, but seems really bored by the whole thing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Ros:  So what's the thing?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grand Maester Pycelle:  What thing?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Ros:  About kings. You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings".
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grand Maester Pycelle:  What? Things? What?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Ros:  When you started, you… Never mind.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grand Maester Pycelle:  Let me see you out, my dear.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Ros:  lt's all right. No need.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Grand Maester Pycelle:  Yes, yes. Till the next time. (Pycelle gets off the bed and stretches his limbs with ease, belying his old age and general sickly demeanor) Right.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	He gets dressed in his robes and looks at himself in the mirror with pride. Before he leaves his chambers, he moves from an upright position to the hunchback he’s always seen with in public. He’s faking it.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	In the Throne Room, Littlefinger and Varys have a chat overlooking the Iron Throne.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  Oh, you can do better than that.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  Playing our roles.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  (Joffrey arrives, Varys bows)  Serving a new King.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Petyr Baelish:  Long may he reign. My king. (bows)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Varys:  My king.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Joffrey Baratheon:  My lords. Shall we begin?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Elsewhere in King’s Landing, Yoren is taking Arya to safety, away from the city.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Yoren:  You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Arya Stark:  Arry.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Yoren:  You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time –  men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Arya bumps into a fat recruit, Hot Pie.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Hot Pie:  Watch yourself, midget.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Lommy Greenhands:  He's got a sword, this one.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Hot Pie:  What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Lommy Greenhands:  Maybe he's a little squire.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Hot Pie:  He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Lommy Greenhands:  Let's have a look. (wrestles Arya to the ground)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Hot Pie:  l could use me a sword like that.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Lommy Greenhands:  Take it off him.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Hot Pie:  Give it here, midget.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Lommy Greenhands:  Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Hot Pie:  l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Arya Stark:  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Hot Pie bumps into Gendry, Robert’s bastard.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Gendry:  Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? (Hot Pie leaves, scared. Gendry talks to Arya alone) This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Arya Stark:  lt was a gift.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Gendry:  lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Arya Stark:  Which are you?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Gendry:  Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Yoren:  (shouting) Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!
s01e10	Fire and Blood	The caravan of the Night’s Watch leaves the walls of King’s Landing.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	-------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Back at Castle Black, Jon is serving Commander Mormont his breakfast.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jeor Mormont:  Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	(Jon looks at the Lord Commander with surprise) Don't look so terrified. lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. Honor made you leave, honor brought you back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  My friends brought me back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jeor Mormont:  l didn't say it was your honor.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  They killed my father.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jeor Mormont:  And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  No.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jeor Mormont:  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  No.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jeor Mormont:  Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jon Snow:  Beyond the Wall?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jeor Mormont:  l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
s01e10	Fire and Blood	The Men of the Night’s Watch gather their forces at leave to range Beyond the Wall. Lord Commander Mormont leads them, with Jon amongst his brothers.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	-------------------------------------------------
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is leading a ceremony for Drogo after his death.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Rakharo:  (picking up the dragon eggs from their chest, speaking in Dothraki) ls this your command, Khaleesi? (Daenerys nods, Rakharo places the eggs next to Drogo’s funeral pyre)
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  They were not given to me to sell.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  l must. You don't understand.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  ls that what you fear? (kisses Jorah on the cheek, then speaks to the rest of the Dothraki and Lhazareen who stayed with her)  You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur is shown tied and bound by rope.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	(to the crowd)  l am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria. I am the Dragon’s daughter. And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Mirri Maz Duur:  You will not hear me scream.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys Targaryen:  I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Daenerys walks towards the pyre and lights it on fire with a torch. Mirri Maz Duur starts uttering some incantations which quickly turn into screaming. Daenerys walks into the burning pyre as her dress catches fire. The flames engulf everything, and the screen fades to black.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	We then cut to the next day in the morning. Jorah goes to the pyre to see if there’s anything left of it. Amidst the smoke, a naked Daenerys appears, covered in soot and carrying three baby dragons in her arms and back.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Jorah Mormont:  (bowing)  Blood of my blood.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Everyone else bows to her as her dragons start screeching. We cut to black over a final screech from one her dragons.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	“Fire and Blood” is the tenth and final episode of the first season of Game of Thrones. It is the tenth episode of the series overall. It premiered on June 19, 2011.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	As tragic news spreads across the Seven Kingdoms, Bran and Rickon share a prophetic dream, Catelyn interrogates Jaime about her son’s fall, and Robb’s destiny is forever changed. After a surprising decision by his father, Tyrion heads south.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Meanwhile, Arya assumes a new identity in an attempt to escape King’s Landing, and Sansa is terrorized by Joffrey. At the Wall, Jon is forced to choose between the Night’s Watch and the family he left behind.
s01e10	Fire and Blood	Across the sea, Dany pays a terrible price for her love, but finds new hope.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. KING’S LANDING
s02e01	The North Remembers	The Hound and another man grunt as they duel. Men and women look on from nearby. The Hound knocks the other man’s shield away, and knocks the man off of a wall. The camera pans up from the man to where Joffrey stands in a tent, watching.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: (Quietly) Well struck… (Louder) Well struck, Dog.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The Hound removes his helmet. Joffrey turns to Sansa.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Did you like that?
s02e01	The North Remembers	SANSA: It was well struck, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: I already said it was well struck.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SANSA: Yes, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Two men drag the man away, leaving behind a trail of blood. A boy walks over to clean up the blood.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Who's next?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ANNOUNCER: Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The announcer gestures to a man, who then walks over.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ANNOUNCER: Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The announcer gestures in the opposite direction, but no one comes forward.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ANNOUNCER: (Yells) Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
s02e01	The North Remembers	SER DONTOS: Here I am. (Walking down some stairs, awkwardly clutching his helmet and weapon).  Here I am. (Drops his helmet). Sorry, Your Grace. (Puts his helmet on backwards). My deepest apologies. (Puts his helmet on correctly).
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Are you drunk?
s02e01	The North Remembers	Ser Dontos takes off his helmet.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SER DONTOS: No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Two cups? (Dontos nods). That's not much at all. (Joffrey gestures to some wine). Please, have another cup.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SER DONTOS: Are you sure, Your Grace?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Yes, to celebrate my name day. (Smiles) Have two, have as much as you like.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SER DONTOS: I would be honored, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Ser Dontos bows to Joffrey. Joffrey looks over to Ser Meryn.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Ser Meryn and two other kingsguard grab Ser Dontos. They bring him into a more open area nearby. Ser Dontos is forced on his knees. One kingsguard keeps Ser Dontos down. Ser Meryn and the other kingsguard get a funnel and a barrel of wine. Ser Meryn forces the funnel into Ser Dontos’s mouth. The kingsguard with the barrel begins pouring the wine down the funnel. Ser Dontos begins gurgling and struggles a little bit.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SANSA: You can't!
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: What did you say? Did you say I can't?
s02e01	The North Remembers	SANSA: I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
s02e01	The North Remembers	THE HOUND: The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: (Sighs). Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The barrel and funnel are removed, and Ser Dontos is released. He pukes out a mixture of blood and wine onto the ground.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SANSA: He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? (Ser Dontos is forced onto his feet). From this day, (Standing up), you'll be my new fool.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SER DONTOS: Thank you, Your Grace. (Bows). And you, My Lady, thank you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Ser Dontos is taken away by kingsguard.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Beloved nephew.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion, Bronn, and a number of hill tribesman appear from the right. People murmur and look their way.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: We looked for you on the battlefield. (Joffrey sits down). You were nowhere to be found.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion begins to pour himself a glass of wine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion gestures towards the Hound. Bronn looks over at the Hound and smiles wryly.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRONN: Can't imagine why.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: We heard you were dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MYRCELLA: I'm glad you're not dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion takes a sip of his wine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. (Looks at Sansa). My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion bows to Sansa. Joffrey looks over at her, and back to Tyrion.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SANSA: My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Of course you are.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion smirks sympathetically. Sansa looks away.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion begins walking away from the tent.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here?
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER
s02e01	The North Remembers	The council members sit at a table. A man walks to the table with a covered bird cage.
s02e01	The North Remembers	PYCELLE: The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, (The man sets the cage down and removes the cover), considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory.
s02e01	The North Remembers	VARYS: The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.
s02e01	The North Remembers	PYCELLE: A common superstition.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, (Shrugs indifferently), we'll have fewer peasants.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cersei gestures to a servant. The servant comes to take the raven off of the table.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: I do, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: And are you not a Lord at my command?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: Yes, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion begins whistling from a distance. Everyone at the table turns to watch him approach.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. (Kisses Cersei on the cheek). War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: What are you doing here?
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: (Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion begins drinking his wine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: What are you doing here? This is the small council.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Our father is Hand of the King.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Yes, but in his absence…
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion pulls out a letter. He hands it to Varys, who opens it, and begins reading it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	VARYS: Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down).
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: I've done nothing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: I tried to stop it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Robb Stark is a child.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: What do you know about warfare?
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
s02e01	The North Remembers	There is a long pause. Cersei looks over at Tyrion.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Joffrey is King.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Joffrey is King.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: You are here to advise him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: How?
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: One.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: One?
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Arya, little animal, she disappeared.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion smirks, and takes a sip of his wine. Cersei looks away.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. OUTSIDE WINTERFELL
s02e01	The North Remembers	A knight sits on a horse alone, holding a banner. Winterfell is seen in the background.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD: My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. INSIDE WINTERFELL’S KEEP
s02e01	The North Remembers	A long queue of people are waiting to speak with Bran. The man speaking is addressing Bran and Maester Luwin, who are both sitting at a large table.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD: The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LUWIN: Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD: Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD: Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD: Of course I remember!
s02e01	The North Remembers	LUWIN: We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD: I - I believe it will.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The man walks away. After a moment, Luwin turns to Bran.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LUWIN: We didn't want him here all day, did we?
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LUWIN: Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.
s02e01	The North Remembers	PORTAN: (Walks forward). My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. WOODS
s02e01	The North Remembers	The camera changes to first-person. A character is running through the woods, panting.  The character looks up to the red comet above the trees, and then back down to the pool in the godswood. The character approaches the pool and looks down at their reflection, revealing themselves to be Summer, Bran’s direwolf.
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. BRAN’S BEDROOM
s02e01	The North Remembers	Bran lays in his bed, asleep. His eyes suddenly open.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT DAY
s02e01	The North Remembers	Hodor walks with Bran on his back, closely following Osha. Osha squats next to some plants. Hodor continues walking.
s02e01	The North Remembers	OSHA: Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Osha pockets some of the plant.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: Don't have any pain.
s02e01	The North Remembers	OSHA: Lucky for you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: That way.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Bran points, and Hodor changes direction, heading for the godswood. Osha turns and begins following them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	OSHA: You've been having those dreams again.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: I don't dream.
s02e01	The North Remembers	OSHA: Everyone dreams.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. (Bran looks up at the comet). They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
s02e01	The North Remembers	OSHA: Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodor’s back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Osha places Bran on the ground. He begins crawling towards the edge of the pool.
s02e01	The North Remembers	OSHA: The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Bran looks at his reflection in the pool.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BRAN: The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CUT TO: ESSOS
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. DESERT
s02e01	The North Remembers	Some people walk through the desert. The camera pans up to reveal Daenerys, with Drogon on her shoulder, and her Khalasar. Daenerys attempts to feed Drogon some meat, but he refuses.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DOREAH: What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: He said they ate meat.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DOREAH: He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Doreah looks down dejectedly. Daenerys gets Drogon off of her shoulder and into his cage. At the front of the group, a horse suddenly collapses. Jorah jogs forward to investigate. Daenerys follows after him. Daenerys kneels down to look at the horse. She looks up at Jorah, who shakes his head. Daenerys looks down sadly.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: She was Drogo's first gift to me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JORAH: I remember.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JORAH: A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: Does it ever end?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JORAH: This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: And you're sure there's no other way?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JORAH: If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: No one will take my dragons.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JORAH: They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: (Turns to Jorah) As you are mine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Daenerys says something in Dothraki, calling Rakharo and some others over. She then stands up, and addresses Rakharo and two others.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.
s02e01	The North Remembers	RAKHARO: (Speaking Dothraki) What do we seek, Khaleesi?
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Rakharo and the other two riders walk away. Later, as Rakharo is almost ready to leave, Daenerys approaches him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood.
s02e01	The North Remembers	RAKHARO: (Speaking Dothraki) I will not fail you, blood of my blood.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAENERYS: You never have.
s02e01	The North Remembers	RAKHARO: This is… bad time to start.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Rakharo and the other two riders take off. Daenerys stares at the red comet, looking troubled.

s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. WOODS
s02e01	The North Remembers	The large party of Night’s Watchmen continue through the woods on horseback. Sam, Grenn, and Edd surround a sledge trapped in the snow on the side of the road.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: Having a rough time of it?
s02e01	The North Remembers	SAM: Nothing's killed me yet.
s02e01	The North Remembers	GRENN: Your ass killed the sledge.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SAM: You offered me a ride!
s02e01	The North Remembers	GRENN: I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The party reaches a large camp. Some of them dismount. The camera pans up to view a large wooden house in the center.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EDD: I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The camera moves through the camp, to show some of the women working.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SAM: Are those girls?
s02e01	The North Remembers	EDD: Craster's daughters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SAM: I haven't seen a girl in six months.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EDD: I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	GRENN: What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?
s02e01	The North Remembers	EDD: (Smirking) He don't like people messing with his wives.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Jon, Sam, and Grenn all look at Edd, surprised.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EDD: He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SAM: That's foul.
s02e01	The North Remembers	GRENN: It's beyond foul.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EDD: All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: What happens to the boys?
s02e01	The North Remembers	SAM: Hmm?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. CRASTER’S LODGE
s02e01	The North Remembers	Craster, Mormont, and a number of watchmen sit around a fire.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. (Sips his wine). Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: (Standing off to the side of the room) We're not Southerners.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: Jon Snow.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: The lad meant no harm.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. (Turns to Jon) Now, sit down and shut your mouth.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Jon takes a seat at the fire.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: You bring any of that good wine with you?
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
s02e01	The North Remembers	As the conversation continues, Jon looks around at some of Craster’s daughters in the rafters.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	WATCHMAN: Yes, commander.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: He's been calling himself that for years. What’s he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
s02e01	The North Remembers	Craster looks at the watchman sitting next to Mormont and points.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: Give it here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Mormont beckons to the watchman, who begrudgingly hands Mormont the axe.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: You'll have another one made at Castle Black. (Hands the axe to Craster). Here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: (Inspecting the axe). Oh, that's some lovely steel. (Loudly brings the axe down). You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: And where does he plan marching this army?
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. (Grabs Gilly) Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.
s02e01	The North Remembers	GILLY: This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: We chose different paths.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. (Stands up).  You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: (Stands up) A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRASTER: (Addressing the group). Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, (Gestures towards Jon),  staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: Your roof, your rules.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The crows all leave the lodge.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. IN THE CAMP
s02e01	The North Remembers	Mormont roughly grabs Jon and pins him against a wooden post.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: (Angrily) Who am I? (Jon looks confused) Who am I?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: Lord commander.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: And who are you?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: Jon Snow.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: Who are you?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JON: Your steward.
s02e01	The North Remembers	LORD MORMONT: You want to lead one day? (Jon nods). Then learn how to follow.

s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. BEACH
s02e01	The North Remembers	The camera pans down from the red comet to Maester Cressen, holding a torch and running. Melisandre can be heard speaking in the distance.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cressen approaches a group gathered on the beach, burning some effigies. Melisandre is speaking to them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e01	The North Remembers	THE GROUP: (In unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cressen reaches the group and hands his torch to another man.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRESSEN: (To Davos) We need to stop her!
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: (Looks to Stannis) Not now.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: And the dead shall rise in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRESSEN: (Walks forward, interrupting Melisandre). All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?
s02e01	The North Remembers	After a long silence, Melisandre approaches Cressen and caresses his face.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	After a moment, Cressen begrudgingly stands aside.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Stannis approaches one of the burning effigies as everyone else looks on. He pulls a sword out from the base and carries it high, to applause. When he sticks it in the sand, the crowd kneels.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CROWD: Lord, cast your light upon us!
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: For the night is dark and full of terror.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Stannis then walks away, almost forgetting to bring his wife with him. The rest of the crowd gets up to leave moments later. Davos and Cressen stay behind a moment to talk.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRESSEN: This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRESSEN: (Scoffs) King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRESSEN: As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. (Davos picks up the sword and inspects it).  If you tell him the truth…
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: What's the truth?
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cressen looks crestfallen. Davos walks away with the sword. Cressen looks up at the burning effigies.
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY
s02e01	The North Remembers	Matthos reads out a letter for Stannis to proofread, as they and some other characters sit around a table.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MATTHOS: “And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: He wasn't my beloved brother. (Matthos looks up). I didn't love him, he didn't love me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: A lie. Take it out.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Matthos scratches ‘beloved’ off of the letter, and then continues.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MATTHOS: “That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Matthos adds in ‘the Kingslayer,’ and continues. Davos notices Cressen slip something into his own glass of wine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MATTHOS: "And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MATTHOS: (Adding Ser) "Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. (Stannis nods). Let all true men declare their loyalty.”
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: He has no need for ships.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.
s02e01	The North Remembers	STANNIS: Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRESSEN: (Stands up). I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAVOS: (Whispers to Cressen) Don't.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cressen stands up with the drugged glass of wine, and walks over to where Melisandre is sitting.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CRESSEN: A cup of wine to honor the one true God.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Melisandre stands up. Everyone at the table reaches for their own wine glasses. Cressen takes a sip of the drugged wine and offers it to Melisandre. Davos nervously watches her take the glass. Cressen begins to stumble and bleed from his nose. Melisandre drink a large portion of the wine. As he falls to the floor dead, Davos and many others stand up. Melisandre appears unphased by the poison.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MELISANDRE: The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CUT TO: NORTH
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. STARK CAMP
s02e01	The North Remembers	The camera pans over a watchtower to a wide shot of the camp. In the camp, Robb stark is led by a man with a torch to where Jaime is being held. Robb enters Jaime’s cage, where he is tied to a wooden pole, a good distance from the walls of the cage.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, "Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy’? Insulted?
s02e01	The North Remembers	Robb looks behind Jaime’s cage. As Jaime nervously strains to look behind him, Grey Wind can be heard heavily walking to the front of the cage.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	With Grey Wind now fully in view, Jaime loses his brave facade.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: No, but he's starting to know me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JAIME: Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: It's better than three defeats.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Robb nudges Grey Wind towards Jaime and leaves the cage. Grey Wind growls in Jaime’s face and comes close to biting him. Jaime closes his eyes in preparation, but when he opens them back up, Grey Wind is gone.

s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: You can smell cum from the balcony?
s02e01	The North Remembers	SHAE: I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: And so did the country.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Shae lays back on Tyrion’s bed.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SHAE: This is where I belong.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SHAE: No one will know.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SHAE: What about you?
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SHAE: Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.
s02e01	The North Remembers	TYRION: Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Tyrion and Shae kiss as a bell rings in the distance.
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. HALLWAY
s02e01	The North Remembers	A servant boy can be seen scrubbing something on the floor, as Baelish walks down a hallway next to a courtyard. Cersei and some kingsguard approach from behind.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Lord Baelish.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: Of course, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Baelish begins walking with Cersei and her guards.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: Curious.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: Yes.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: And which truth is that?
s02e01	The North Remembers	BAELISH: Knowledge is power.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cersei walks away from Baelish, her guards following close behind. The servant boy scrubbing the floor looks up at Baelish.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CUT TO: NORTH
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. ROBB’S TENT
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: You're Ser Alton Lannister?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ALTON: I am, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ALTON: An honorable request, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Alton looks at him wide-eyed.
s02e01	The North Remembers	SER RODRIK: The King in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	THE OTHERS AT THE TABLE: King in the North.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ALTON: These are... Your Grace, these are...
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ALTON: King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.
s02e01	The North Remembers	After everyone else leaves the tent, Theon approaches Robb.
s02e01	The North Remembers	THEON: A word, Your Grace?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.
s02e01	The North Remembers	THEON: It's not so bad once you get used to it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
s02e01	The North Remembers	THEON: The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Of course they are.
s02e01	The North Remembers	THEON: We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Men who fought my father.
s02e01	The North Remembers	THEON: Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: I need his ships. They say he has 200.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
s02e01	The North Remembers	Catelyn is preparing to go somewhere, gathering up various items.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
s02e01	The North Remembers	A long pause follows. Catelyn sits down.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: You can't go to Winterfell.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: I beg your pardon?
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: Why in the name of all the Gods -
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: I will ride at first light.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Robb kisses Catelyn’s forehead, and they embrace.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: We will all be together again soon, I promise.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROBB: (Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CATELYN: King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CUT TO: KING’S LANDING
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. THRONE ROOM
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cersei and her guards enter the throne room. Extensive work is being done, overseen by Joffrey.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: What is all this?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: We can't find Arya Stark.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: His life is in danger.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
s02e01	The North Remembers	CERSEI: What are you asking?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
s02e01	The North Remembers	Cersei instinctively slaps Joffrey. It grows quiet as many workers look over at Joffrey and Cersei. Joffre looks up shocked, and then around to the workers in the room. Cersei appears nervous.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JOFFREY: What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother.
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. BROTHEL
s02e01	The North Remembers	A man and a woman are having sex. The woman is shrieking loudly.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The man and woman go back to having sex, this time with the woman slowly moaning.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Roz walks Daisy through the brothel.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAISY: Haystack Hall.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAISY: Littlefinger's a fancy man.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish.
s02e01	The North Remembers	As they enter a new room, a prostitute and two men with her get up to leave.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
s02e01	The North Remembers	DAISY: She's beautiful.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Janos is followed by a number of gold cloaks, some of whom are dragging along a prisoner. Some leave to search other rooms.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: Orders.
s02e01	The North Remembers	ROZ: Whose orders?
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MHAEGAN: No, you can't!
s02e01	The North Remembers	Some gold cloaks force Mhaegan and her baby, Barra, into the room. She begins crying. The prisoner looks at Barra, and back to Janos. He then nods. A gold cloak lets go of the prisoner and takes the Barra from Mhaegan.
s02e01	The North Remembers	MHAEGAN: No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.
s02e01	The North Remembers	The gold cloak holds a knife to the baby’s throat, hesitantly. Throughout the whole ordeal, Mhaegan continues begging for Barra’s life.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.
s02e01	The North Remembers	After a moment, Janos takes out a knife and grabs the baby.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: Give it here.
s02e01	The North Remembers	Janos kills the baby just off screen, and Mhaegan shrieks. Janos and the other gold cloaks leave the brothel.
s02e01	The North Remembers	EXT. A DOCK
s02e01	The North Remembers	Some gold cloaks walk along a dock. They go up some stairs.
s02e01	The North Remembers	GOLD CLOAK: Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room.
s02e01	The North Remembers	INT. A HOUSE
s02e01	The North Remembers	Some gold cloaks burst into a house and kill the inhabitants.

s02e01	The North Remembers	Janos and a number of gold cloaks arrive at the smithy. A gold cloak is holding the blacksmith’s face near some hot coals.
s02e01	The North Remembers	BLACKSMITH: Gendry! His name is Gendry.
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: Where is the bastard?
s02e01	The North Remembers	BLACKSMITH: The Night's Watch! Please, stop!
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: Where?
s02e01	The North Remembers	BLACKSMITH: They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!
s02e01	The North Remembers	JANOS: How will we know him?
s02e01	The North Remembers	BLACKSMITH: He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.

s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: You brought this on yourself.

s02e02	The Night Lands	EDD: He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.

s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. DRAGONSTONE
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: (Reading a letter) My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister, and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth, and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

s02e02	The Night Lands	ROBB: I’m sending one of your cousins down to King’s Landing with my peace terms.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JAIME: You think my father’s going to negotiate with you? You don’t know him very well.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: We won’t beat them until we take King’s Landing, and we can’t take King’s Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ROBB: Men who fought my father.

s02e02	The Night Lands	TITLE SEQUENCE
s02e02	The Night Lands	Water can be heard trickling down. The opening shot is of Arya, her back to the camera, sitting by a pool of water in the woods. She turns her head to the left. Then some leaves rustle, and she turns to the right. A horse whinnies, and she walks towards some other people. Many of them are gathering wood, and she joins in. Jaqen H’ghar, Rorge, and Biter watch her as she walks past their cage.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JAQEN: (Whispers) Boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Arya looks up at the cage.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JAQEN: (Whispers) Lovely boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: (Stops walking). What do you want?
s02e02	The Night Lands	JAQEN: A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: (Walks toward the cave). I have friends.
s02e02	The Night Lands	RORGE: Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JAQEN: A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods).  This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath.
s02e02	The Night Lands	RORGE: Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!
s02e02	The Night Lands	Arya throws down the wood she was holding and looks at Rorge angrily.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: You should have asked nicely.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Arya begins hitting the cage with a stick, trying to hit Rorge. Rorge tries to claw back. Jaqen laughs at the exchange. Biter looks on.
s02e02	The Night Lands	RORGE: Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JAQEN: (Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.
s02e02	The Night Lands	RORGE: Come here!
s02e02	The Night Lands	Rorge reaches out at Arya. Gendry walks past holding wood. Arya joins him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
s02e02	The Night Lands	RORGE: Come here!
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: They don't scare me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Two gold cloaks ride in on horseback. Gendry puts down the wood he was carrying.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
s02e02	The Night Lands	Arya attempts to hide under some wood.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: What are you doing?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: They're looking for me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GOLD CLOAK: You're in command here?
s02e02	The Night Lands	YOREN: You're a long way from home.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GOLD CLOAK: I asked you a question.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YOREN: Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GOLD CLOAK: (Pulls out rolled up paper and hands it to Yoren). I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Gendry looks at Arya. Arya looks back, pursing her lips.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YOREN: Well the thing is, (Hands back the paper), these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.
s02e02	The Night Lands	The gold cloak tries to pull out his sword. Yoren quickly pulls out his dagger and puts it to the man’s leg.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YOREN: It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Yoren takes the gold cloak’s sword. The other gold cloak pulls his out.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YOREN: We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GOLD CLOAK: We're looking for a boy named Gendry. (Gendry and Arya look shocked). He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. (To Yoren) And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	The gold cloaks ride off. Gendry and Arya stands up. Everyone in the party turns to look at Gendry.

s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. RED KEEP
s02e02	The Night Lands	Tyrion walks through a room and into a hallway, whistling. As he opens the door to his room, Shae laughs, and he stops whistling. Shae and Varys are sitting at a table. Varys stands up, and Tyrion looks at Shae, and closes the door.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: My lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SHAE: You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: It was quite a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Tyrion walks over to the window to get some wine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SHAE: And I tell him the story of how we meet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: (Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SHAE: I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: How can you tell?
s02e02	The Night Lands	SHAE: I can always tell.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shae’s hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Shae stands up, and walks away. Tyrion puts his hand on the door, blocking it from being opened.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I don't like threats.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: Who threatened you?
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: Ned Stark was a man of honor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Tyrion opens the door. He and Varys exit. Varys closes the door behind them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
s02e02	The Night Lands	The small council sits at their table. Alton stands nearby. Cersei is reading a letter aloud.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: “From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ALTON: I will, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
s02e02	The Night Lands	Varys and Baelish look annoyed.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ALTON: I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ALTON: I will, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Safe travels, cousin.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Alton leaves the room, followed by two gold cloaks.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: If that's everything?
s02e02	The Night Lands	PYCELLE: (Holding a letter). A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Pycelle hands the letter to Tyrion, who unfurls it and begins reading.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: Trouble with the wildlings?
s02e02	The Night Lands	BAELISH: That's why they're called wildlings.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	PYCELLE: The northerners are a superstitious people.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Everyone but Tyrion stands up to leave.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie.
s02e02	The Night Lands	VARYS: How do you kill a dead man?
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Apparently you burn him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys).
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Everyone but Tyrion leaves.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CUT TO: BEYOND THE WALL
s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. CRASTER’S CAMP
s02e02	The Night Lands	Sam, Edd, and Grenn are standing at a table. Edd and Grenn are cutting food.
s02e02	The Night Lands	EDD: Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GRENN: We fart when we die?
s02e02	The Night Lands	EDD: My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Edd makes farting noises with his mouth as they continue to cut food. Sam looks up and watches Gilly walk past.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?
s02e02	The Night Lands	EDD: We were having a serious discussion.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Grenn looks up to watch some of the women.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GRENN: Would you look at that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GRENN: I prefer watching them come towards me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: I'm sure that's nice too.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GRENN: Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, (laughs), changed.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: You were with her? How many times?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GRENN: Well, as many times as I could.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
s02e02	The Night Lands	EDD: We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. (Sam begins to walk away). Get the turnips too.
s02e02	The Night Lands	As Sam continues walking, a dog barks. Then a woman screams. Sam turns around to see Gilly backed up against a fence post. Ghost stands in front of her, eyeing the meat she is carrying. Sam begins slowly walking over.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAME: No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! (Ghost walks away). (To Gilly)  You all right? Did he frighten you?
s02e02	The Night Lands	Sam reaches out to touch Gilly, but she flinches back.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GILLY: You shouldn't touch me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause).
s02e02	The Night Lands	GILLY: You're very brave.
s02e02	The Night Lands	The camera moves to a shot of Jon sharpening his sword. He stops and looks up as Sam and Gilly approach him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: What’re you doing?
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GILLY: Sam said you could help.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: What? (Stands up).
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: I know it sounds a bit mad.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: Sam we can't take her -
s02e02	The Night Lands	GILLY: Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: It's just not possible.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GILLY: I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Gilly looks taken aback, and then runs off.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: Why did you do that?
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: Do what, ask her a question?
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: You were cruel.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: I didn't touch her!
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAM: I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JON: I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Jon sits back down, and returns to sharpening his sword. Sam walks away. When Sam is gone, Jon sighs deeply.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CUT TO: ESSOS
s02e02	The Night Lands	EXT. DESERT
s02e02	The Night Lands	The camera pans across Daenerys’s people, many of whom appear tired and weak. Jorah and Daenerys sit near each other. After looking out for a few moments, Jorah takes a sip of his water, and then sighs. Then a horse can be heard approaching. Jorah looks up at it, and it is shown to be riderless.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JORAH: Khaleesi.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Daenerys looks up at the horse. Jorah gets up. The horse is covered in red paint. Jorah walks over to it. A soaking wet sack is attached to it. Some hair can be seen poking out of the top. Flies can be heard buzzing. Jorah feels the hair, and Daenerys gets up from where she was sitting to approach the horse. Jorah pulls the object in the sack out a little bit by the hair, revealing it to be a human head. He then puts it back in the sack. Jorah picks up the ponytail of the head, which has been cut off.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JORAH: You don't need to see this.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAENERYS: He is blood of my blood.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Daenerys looks in the sack, and then quickly looks away.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAENERYS: Who did this?
s02e02	The Night Lands	JORAH: Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAENERYS: They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Irri walks over and sees the head. She then falls to her knees, crying.
s02e02	The Night Lands	IRRI: No! (Speaking Dothraki, to Daenerys) They killed his soul!
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
s02e02	The Night Lands	IRRI: (Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irri’s level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Daenerys looks up at Jorah. Jorah looks down. Daenerys addresses Irri again, holding her head.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAENERYS: (Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Daenerys continues to comfort Irri as she cries. Irri wails loudly.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CUT TO: IRON ISLANDS
s02e02	The Night Lands	EXT. BOAT
s02e02	The Night Lands	Theon stands on a boat, looking out at the Iron Islands. He smiles. The camera then cuts to him below deck. A naked woman lies in his bed. He walks towards the windows.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: Is it as you remember my lord?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: (Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: (Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: Who will?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: I love the cold and wet.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: Then you'll be king before long.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: (Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Theon stands up and roughly pushes her back onto the bed.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: (Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-
s02e02	The Night Lands	The woman groans as they begin having sex.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Your place is on this ship.
s02e02	The Night Lands	WOMAN: Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I haven't paid you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Theon flips her over, and they continue having sex.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CUT TO: KING’S LANDING
s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. BROTHEL
s02e02	The Night Lands	A prostitute and a man are having sex. A man is watching them through a small hole, while he himself is getting a blowjob. He holds some keys in his hand, which are jingling as he pushes the prostitute’s head. Baelish, in turn, is watching this man. He hears a noise and turns around, then covers the hole he was watching through. A man emerges from another room. A woman can be heard crying from inside.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MAN: I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BAELISH: One moment, my friend. A moment.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Baelish snaps his fingers, and a woman emerges from another room, covered only in gold jewelry. Out of sight, Baelish wipes some semen from her face with a cloth, and then turns back to the disgruntled man.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BAELISH: Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Upon seeing Ramka, the man smiles. As they begin to kiss passionately, Baelish goes to investigate the crying woman. He enters the room to see Roz, curled up on the bed, crying. He walks over to her, putting a hand on her back, and then sits next to her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ROZ: I’m sorry, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BAELISH: Shhh. Did he hurt you?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ROZ: No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BAELISH: Who?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ROZ: She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BAELISH: Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ROZ: Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BAELISH: You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy? (Roz nods and smiles). That makes me happy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. DINING ROOM
s02e02	The Night Lands	PODRICK: More wine?
s02e02	The Night Lands	The scene begins zoomed in on Podrick pouring Janos a glass of wine. He then spills, and we see Tyrion and Janos sitting at a table.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: Damn it, boy!
s02e02	The Night Lands	PODRICK: Apologies, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: (Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: You know your wines, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: That I do. A fine dinner, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION:Wars have been started for less.
s02e02	The Night Lands	They both laugh. Janos sips his wine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: Orders are orders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: I never said they were the queen's orders.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: You know your sister better than I do.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: I don't listen to filth.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine).
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	When your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order?
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Tyrion gestures towards Bronn, who has appeared in the room.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: No, we shan't.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Tyrion nods at Bronn, who gestures for some armed men to enter the room.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BRONN: The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BRONN: Boys?
s02e02	The Night Lands	The gold cloaks in the room escort Janos out. Janos begins shouting as they take him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	JANOS: I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
s02e02	The Night Lands	Janos is escorted out of view. Bronn sits down, and Tyrion pours him a cup of wine.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: To the new Commander.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Tyrion and Bronn clink their glasses together. Then they both sip.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?
s02e02	The Night Lands	BRONN: Without question? No. I'd ask how much.

s02e02	The Night Lands	Gendry gathers some water in a bucket. Lommy and Hot Pie sit next to the river, washing things. Arya sits away from them, doing the same.
s02e02	The Night Lands	LOMMY: If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: I'm not afraid of no battles.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: Liar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
s02e02	The Night Lands	LOMMY: Two men fighting isn't a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: They had armor on.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: So?
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	LOMMY: No, it isn't.
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: (Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: (Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: Now who told you that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: A knight?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: How'd you know he was a knight?
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: Well, cause he got armor on.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).
s02e02	The Night Lands	HOT PIE: How'd you know?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: ‘Cause I sold armor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Lommy nudges Hot Pie, and they both get up and leave. Arya stops washing and stands up, walking over to Gendry.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: What do the gold cloaks want with you?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: (Turning around) No idea.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: You're a liar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: (Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY:  Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: Who asked questions?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: Lord Stark.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: What did they ask about?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: My mom.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: Who's your mom?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: And who was your father?
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: I'm not a girl!
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: (Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: That's true. You're still a girl.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: I am not!
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: They won't. Not from me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ARYA: Do not call me milady.
s02e02	The Night Lands	GENDRY: As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Arya pushes Gendry to the ground. He laughs, and she stomps off.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CUT TO: IRON ISLANDS
s02e02	The Night Lands	EXT. DOCKSThe scene starts with a wide shot of the busy docks. Theon stands in a rowboat as is comes up against the side of a wall. He gets out and walks up some stairs. An old man spots him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MAN: What you carrying?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. (The man makes no response). The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. (The man continues to make no response). Me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MAN: Don't like wine. Woman's drink. (Returns to his work).
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I need to get to Pyke.
s02e02	The Night Lands	The man looks up, but makes no move or response. Theon looks annoyed and pulls out some coins.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MAN: I'll find you a horse.
s02e02	The Night Lands	The man takes the coins and walks away. Theon watches as the rowboat that took him there leaves. He looks down.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I bet you can.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: None like you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: You don't know what I'm like.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Yara and Theon pass the man as they are walking. He is leading a horse. Theon gives him some more coins.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Have my things sent up to the castle.
s02e02	The Night Lands	EXT. BEACH
s02e02	The Night Lands	Yara and Theon ride on horseback on a beach. Yara is at the reins.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: Is that an offer from my future king?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night.
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
s02e02	The Night Lands	As they approach the castle, the camera pans up to view it in its entirety.
s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. INSIDE PYKE
s02e02	The Night Lands	Balon sits in front of a fireplace. Theon enters the room.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Father.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: A man. Your blood and your heir.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Lord Stark is gone.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: And how do you feel about that?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: Who gave you those clothes? (Stands up).  Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: If my clothes offend you, I will change them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: It will. (Begins walking forward). That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? (Theon looks down). I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Gold.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Balon reaches out and rips the bauble off. Theon’s cloak falls to the ground.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. (Balon walks towards the fireplace and looks into it). My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: (Steps forward). My blood is salt and iron.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: Yet, (Turns around), the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: The offer he makes, is one I proposed.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: He heeds your counsel?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: No, not here, (Walks forward), not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Theon holds a letter out. Balon takes it and turns around. He then unfurls it and reads it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I will lead the attack myself.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: Oh, you will?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
s02e02	The Night Lands	Someone enters the room. Balon looks behind Theon, and he turns to look as well.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: (Puts his arm around her). My dear.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: Yara?
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: She can't lead an attack!
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: And why not?
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: You're a woman!
s02e02	The Night Lands	YARA: You're the one in skirts.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	ALL THREE: (Theon joins a little late). What's dead may never die.
s02e02	The Night Lands	The only night she's spent off these islands has been spent on the sea. She's commanded men. She's killed men. She knows who she is.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Balon leans down and burns the letter in the fire. Yara smirks at Theon.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON: (Watching the letter burn in his hand). No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. (Throws the letter in the fire). That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Balon walks away. Yara follows him. Theon turns around to watch them leave.
s02e02	The Night Lands	THEON: You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
s02e02	The Night Lands	BALON:Who said anything about the Lannisters?
s02e02	The Night Lands	CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE
s02e02	The Night Lands	EXT. BEACH
s02e02	The Night Lands	Davos and Salladhor Saan walk on a beach. Matthos follows closely behind them..
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: And yet, they both have larger armies.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: Mind your words, pirate. (They all stop walking).
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Matthos.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: That's a promise that always comes true.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong: Most pirates don't grow old.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: Only the clever ones.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: One thing, I want the queen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: The queen?
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: As if she would just let you!
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Matthos walks away angrily. Saan turns back to Davos.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: You believe your king can win?
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: He is the one true king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	SAAN: You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
s02e02	The Night Lands	They shake hands. Davos pats Saan on the back as he walks away. Saan and Matthos eye each other as Saan walks past. Matthos walks back over to his father.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: When will the King have a sail?
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: As soon as his God wills it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Oh you and your mother.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: But you always came home.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: I wasn't praying.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: (They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: (As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Don't tell him that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Davos rides away and Matthos watches. In the background, Saan’s boat is in the water.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CUT TO: KING’S LANDING
s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. TYRION’S ROOM
s02e02	The Night Lands	Tyrion sits at a table with a cup of wine. Cersei paces in front of him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: Ha, the people. You think I care?
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Cersei looks down and walks toward the window. Tyrion looks down, and then up at her.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: (Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.
s02e02	The Night Lands	TYRION: She was my mother too.
s02e02	The Night Lands	CERSEI: Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out).

s02e02	The Night Lands	INT. DRAGONSTONE KEEP
s02e02	The Night Lands	Davos moves some ships around on a model map of Westeros as Matthos looks on. Stannis enters with Melisandre.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MATTHOS: Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: How did it fare with your pirate?
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Does seem the wiser choice.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	But once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: At once, Your Grace.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Davos walks away, followed by Matthos. As Matthos passes her, Melisandre stops him.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.
s02e02	The Night Lands	She then whispers something in his ear. When she is done, Matthos and Davos leave the room.
s02e02	The Night Lands	DAVOS: Come.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: What did you say to him?
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: I told him death by fire is the purest death.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: Why?
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: Yeah.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: Tell your lord to burn them then.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: You must have faith.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: Then we must be the ten.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: You must give... all of yourself.
s02e02	The Night Lands	Melisandre disrobes next to Stannis. He looks over and then looks away.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: I have a wife. I took a vow.
s02e02	The Night Lands	MELISANDRE: She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King.
s02e02	The Night Lands	STANNIS: (Gasps). A son?
s02e02	The Night Lands	They begin kissing. Melisandre takes off what remained of her clothes. Stannis lays her on the table and they begin having sex, knocking many of the wooden models off of the table.

s02e02	The Night Lands	Jon is sitting by a fire. He hears a noise and looks behind himself, seeing Craster walking away from the camp with a baby. Jon gets up to follow Craster and investigate, and walks into the woods. He begins hearing strange noises, and hides when he sees Craster walking back, without the baby. When Craster is out of sight, he runs in the direction Craster came from. He sees a figure lean down and pick up the baby. He is then startled by Craster, who puts his hand on Jon’s shoulder, and then knocks Jon out.

s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT. CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	A door crashes open as CRASTER throws JON SNOW through it and onto the floor.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CRASTER: Out, all of you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORD COMMANDER JEOR MORMONT and the others of the Night's Watch leap to their feet. CRASTER'S wives peer out from their berths.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CRASTER: This bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CRASTER kicks JON in the abdomen for emphasis.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CRASTER: (pointing at JEOR with the handle of JEOR's sheathed sword) I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON stands and spits out a mouthful of blood.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: (to JON) Wait outside.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON: Lord Commander-
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: Now!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON leaves.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	EXT: CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR strides through camp until he finds JON and SAMWELL TARLY, who is tending to JON's wounds.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM: Lord Commander-
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: Leave us.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM leaves.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: What did you do?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON: I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: What business is that of yours?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON: No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys...
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON breaks off as JEOR stares back at him mutely. JON's face narrows in realization.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON: You know.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON: Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON: I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR hands JON his sword.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JEOR: Don't lose it again.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JON watches as JEOR walks away.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	EXT: CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM arranges some crates containing ravens. GILLY walks by holding a basket. SAM quietly walks over to where she is loading her basket with sticks.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM: (whispering) Gilly.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GILLY: You're leaving.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM: I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM shows GILLY a white thimble.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GILLY: I can't take it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM: Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GILLY: You, you shouldn't give it away.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM: I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM takes GILLY'S hand and places the thimble in her open palm.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SAM: Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GILLY stares at SAM, then pulls her hand from his, grabs her basket, and flees. SAM smiles before leaving as well.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The day begins in Winterfell. Two men work together to fix a wheel on a cart while another man rides in on a horse pulling a cart. Chickens cluck in the background. HODOR is enjoying watching all the activity.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	HODOR: Hodor.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MAESTER LUWIN approaches HODOR from the corridor behind him.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN: Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: WINTERFELL
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	HODOR walks through the castle, passing by a girl holding a bundle of wheat, who looks at HODOR for a moment before quickly getting out of his way. He arrives at a door at the end of the corridor.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORD BRAN STARK jerks awake from a dream to find his direwolf SUMMER standing above him on his bed, their faces close to touching. HODOR stands at the foot of the bed by the open door. BRAN sits in bed, panting, as the other two look on silently.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRAN: (voiceover) Every night it's the same.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	It is now evening and BRAN is calm and seated upright in his bed. He is telling LUWIN about his recurring dreams.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRAN: I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN: That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRAN: So she was lying? They don't exist?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN: Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRAN: No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN: What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN shows his chain to BRAN.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN: This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN tucks BRAN into bed.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LUWIN: All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	EXT: STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	An exhibition fight between two armored knights takes places as KING RENLY BARATHEON and QUEEN MARGAERY TYRELL watch. LADY CATELYN STARK and SER COLEN OF GREENPOOLS enter and watch from among the crowd. SER LORAS TYRELL, one of the battling knights, lands a solid blow.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: (standing and clapping) Loras! Highgarden!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MAN: Get him!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The other fighter lifts LORAS and takes him to the ground, then lifts LORAS's visor and draws a dagger to his face. MARGAERY gasps nervously.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CROWD: Oh!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: Yield! I yield.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY sits, disappointed. The spectators grow quiet.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: (claps) Well fought. Approach.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The second knight approaches first and kneels while LORAS looks on.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Rise. Remove your helm.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The knight removes her helm to reveal her identity as LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH. The crowd gasps. CATELYN looks mildly stunned at the turn of events, while LORAS appears angry and humiliated.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRIENNE: (kneels) Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: What?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The crowd gasps.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRIENNE: I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS stares at RENLY.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The crowd applauds. RENLY gives BRIENNE a small wink. LORAS continues to stare at RENLY, clearly irritated. BRIENNE stands as SER COLEN makes his way across the sand towards where RENLY is seated. CATELYN follows.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	COLEN: Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: You are most kind.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The crowd roars and LORAS glances around, ill at ease. CATELYN closes her eyes as she takes a breath before continuing.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRIENNE: Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: (disdainfully) I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: (petulantly) If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY chuckles and stands. He leaves the dais and walks over to CATELYN.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY and CATELYN leave. MARGAERY watches, annoyed.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	EXT: RENLY'S CAMP
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY and CATELYN walk side by side, with BRIENNE behind them. They encounter a man with a horse.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GERARD: Your Grace.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Gerard. How's your foot?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GERARD: Better, Your Grace.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GERARD pats his horse.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GERARD: They don't know their own size is all.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Good man.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	They continue walking.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Why?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRIENNE: At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY departs with his guards. BRIENNE and CATELYN continue together.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRIENNE: If you'll follow me, my lady.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CATELYN: You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRIENNE: I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRIENNE continues walking, while CATELYN lags behind, a small smile on her face.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORD THEON GREYJOY looks around the throne room. LADY YARA GREYJOY appears from the shadows behind him.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: What are you doing here?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: You lying bitch.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: Why didn't you tell me?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORD BALON GREYJOY enters.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON: The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: Father.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: Father.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	They look over a map of Westeros.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON: The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON looks at his father and BALON meets his eyes, holding his gaze for a moment before continuing.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON: Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: I've always wanted a castle.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: And what's my role in all this?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON: You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: (incredulous) I'm to fight fishermen?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: Be careful of their nets.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON moves to the other side of the table to stand closer to BALON.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON: Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON: What are our words? Our words?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: We do not sow.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON: We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON backhands THEON, who falls back. BALON starts to exit the room.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: You gave me away!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON stops.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BALON exits. YARA walks over to THEON and gets in his face.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: I have no other family.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA: Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YARA leaves.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE paces while LORD TYRION LANNISTER sits and reads some parchment at a desk.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: (shushing her) Keep your voice down.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Why? You think your father can hear me? (yells) He's three hundred miles away!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE gives TYRION a look.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Again, only temporary.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Scullion? What is a scullion?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: (wincing) Kitchen wench.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: A kitchen wench?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Yes, but-
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE stalks across the room to stand in front of TYRION.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION sets down the parchment and comes out from behind the desk.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION fiddles with a fold in SHAE's dress.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: I'm the weakness?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: It's a compliment, my lady.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: How is being a weakness a compliment?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Language can be a bit tricky here.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: (with a mocking tone) Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. (sternly) I am not a kitchen wench.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION tries to kiss SHAE but she jerks back. She yanks her dress out of TYRION's hands and strides away from him. TYRION looks down, exasperated.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER dines with LADY SANSA STARK, PRINCE TOMMEN, and PRINCESS MYRCELLA. The room is silent and awkward.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MYRCELLA: When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA's head jerks up and she looks over at CERSEI.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: Soon, darling, when the war is over.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MYRCELLA: (to SANSA) Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA doesn't reply, a look of trepidation on her face. At her lack of response, MYRCELLA looks back at SANSA, as does CERSEI.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: The princess just spoke to you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: (to CERSEI) Pardon, Your Grace. (to MYRCELLA) I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI watches SANSA as she makes her statement. SANSA looks close to tears at the end.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TOMMEN: Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA looks over at CERSEI again.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: He might.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA takes a long drink of wine.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: Would you like that?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI's answer is directed at TOMMEN, but she is looking at SANSA when she says it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TOMMEN: No. I don't think so.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI looks at SANSA, a small cold smile on her face. SANSA looks away, dejected.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA continues to look dejected, this time into her mirror. There is a knock at the door and SANSA starts.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: Come in.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE enters.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: Who are you?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: No.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	They regard each other silently.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: What are you doing?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: What things?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: (irritated) Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE closes the door and picks up a brush to comb SANSA's hair. SANSA stops her.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: No.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: You said to brush your-
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: (exasperated) Not now.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE looks at SANSA's chamber pot.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Your chamber pot is empty.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: Clean the table.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE sets the brush down and goes over to the table. She pops a piece of fruit in her mouth and she begins gathering plates.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Yes.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: For whom?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Lady Zuriff.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: Lady Zuriff
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Lady Zuriff.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: She wasn't in this city.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: (testily, with a wavering voice) I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE: Do you want me to leave?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	They stare at each other for a moment.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SANSA: Just brush my hair.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	SHAE sets the plates back on the table and brushes SANSA's hair in silence.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE hands TYRION a vial of medicine.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION indicates the chair behind PYCELLE.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Please.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Thank you, my lord.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE sits.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Why, yes, of course, my lord.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION sits in the chair opposite PYCELLE.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Matrimony, huh? Yes.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION walks to pour a drink.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION returns to the chairs with a cup of wine in each hand.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: But remember, the Queen mustn't know.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS now occupies the seat where PYCELLE had been sitting.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: Ooh. "The Queen mustn't know." I love conversations that begin this way.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Precisely.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION turns and slowly walks away from VARYS.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: But remember, you must tell no one.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION turns around and LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH is now leaning against the desk, VARYS nowhere in sight.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: Tell no one what?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Who better?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER walks around the desk as he ponders.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: Harrenhal is cursed.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: (nods)
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Good. Oh. And remember-
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: The Queen mustn't know.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION drinks deeply and sets his empty glass on a table before exiting. LITTLEFINGER ponders.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY and LORAS are kissing passionately. RENLY brings LORAS to the bed and sits astride him. RENLY removes his own shirt, kisses LORAS, and undoes his shirt. He sees the heavy bruising on LORAS's chest.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: That must hurt.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS refuses to kiss him, pouting.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: What? What is it?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: (scoffs) A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Brienne is a very capable warrior.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY kisses LORAS, who pulls back.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: I'll make it up to you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY moves to remove LORAS's pants, but LORAS grabs his hands.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY lies down, dejected, but then decides to try to seduce LORAS one more time. LORAS resists.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: And Margaery's a virgin?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LORAS: Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY tries one last time to kiss LORAS, who shoves him away onto the bed in response. LORAS leaves to get his sister.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY pours some wine for himself and drinks it. MARGAERY enters.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: As is your right. You are a king.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: You look very beautiful.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: Thank you, Your Grace.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: It's a lovely gown.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY removes her gown. RENLY pauses, embarrassed.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY:  You certainly don't need it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY starts kissing RENLY, but he resists and continues talking.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY hushes him and begins kissing again. She reaches to his groin, but is disappointed by his lack of excitement.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: Must be the wine.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: Here, let me.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	She undoes his pants and tries to excite him. RENLY is obviously uncomfortable.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: I'm sorry.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: Do you want my brother to come in and help?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY whips his head around to look at MARGAERY.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: What?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY: I don't know what you're talking about.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY walks over to the bed and sits.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY sits next to him on the bed. She rubs his shoulder soothingly.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY turns RENLY's head to look at her.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MARGAERY: Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	RENLY sighs and MARGAERY kisses his cheek.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION enters and CERSEI stalks over to him.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEl: (angry and tearful) You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Dorne is the safest place for her.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: She'll be a hostage.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: A guest.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: It's done, Cersei.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI:  No.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: You cannot stop it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI sweeps glassware from the table in frustration. It hits the floor and shatters.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI:  No!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	CERSEI: Get out! Get out!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	She pushes TYRION, who falls back onto the small set of stairs behind him. CERSEI looks at him with disgust. She turns, sits, and begins to weep. TYRION climbs the stairs and exits.

s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON reads over a letter he has written to KING ROBB STARK. He decides to burn it instead.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	EXT: IRON ISLANDS, SHORELINE
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON and a drowned priest stand in ankle deep water while soldiers look on.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PRIEST: Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON looks over at BALON.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: I would.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	DROWNED PRIEST:  Kneel.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON kneels.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	DROWNED PRIEST: Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The DROWNED PRIEST pours water over THEON's head after every blessing.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON: What is dead may never die.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	DROWNED PRIEST: What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	THEON stands. BALON and YARA look on.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION sits and ponders. LITTLEFINGER enters, enraged.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: No, afraid not. Sorry about that.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: Leave me out of your next deception.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LITTLEFINGER: Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRONN enters.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Find him?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRONN: Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: No, you don't.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRONN: No, I don't.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRONN leaves. TYRION sets down the book he was holding and gives LITTLEFINGER a wry smile.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE and a prostitute lie on a bed. She is naked, while he is fully clothed. The door bursts open and the couple jumps as BRONN and TIMETT walk in. The woman flees the bed and PYCELLE sits up in indignation.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: What is the meaning of this?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION stops and stands in the doorway. BRONN walks over and pulls PYCELLE out of the bed. PYCELLE stumbles forward and stands hunched over.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: No, please, please.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: You disappoint me, Grand Maester.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: I am your loyal servant.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION walks over to the desk and pulls out the chair. It scrapes against the floor. TYRION sits.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION picks something made of gold up off the desk and plays with it while he talks.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: The eunuch has spies everywhere.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: No, no, no.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TIMETT: There are no goats, halfman.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Well, make do.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE recoils from TIMETT, landing on the bed. BRONN smiles.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: How long have you been spying for my sister?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION ponders for a moment, bouncing his fingers on the armrests of the chair. He shakes his head.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: (to BRONN) I don't like his beard.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: What? What?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRONN grabs PYCELLE by the beard, then chops it off with a large knife.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Oh, no. No.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE cries out as he feels what remains of his beard.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: So you poisoned him?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: (offended) No. Never.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Lannister, I always served Lannister.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BRONN and TIMETT wrestle Pycelle out of the room.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PYCELLE: Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION leaves a coin on the chair for the prostitute, who is cowering in the corner and looks appears to be in shock.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: For your trouble.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The struggle continues, so TYRION decides to double his payment in compensation. The prostitute nods meekly.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS and TYRION sit at table. VARYS drinks some wine.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Good. One of my better ideas.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION shrugs his glass towards VARYS with a small smile.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Why, am I about to hear one?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: Depends on the sellsword.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: He has a sword, the power of life and death.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	TYRION: I've decided I don't like riddles.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	VARYS: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	They both drink.

s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: I can't sleep.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN offers her his wineskin.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: I don't like the taste.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: (chuckles) Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN leans back against the wall and closes his eyes. ARYA stares him. He opens his eyes and she looks away. He closes his eyes again.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: What?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: How do you sleep?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: Same as most men, I think.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: But you've seen things, horrible things.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN raises his head and looks at her.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA is close to tears. YOREN thinks for a bit before responding.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN gives a little laugh as he takes a drink from his wineskin. Horn blasts ring out from outside. YOREN rises quickly in response and starts rousing the sleeping recruits.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GENDRY: Get up.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: Get up.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN comes back across the room to address ARYA and GENDRY.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: Keep out of sight, both of you.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: No, I'm not afraid.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GENDRY: I can fight.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: (pointing at both of them) Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN quickly retreats from ARYA and GENDRY, heading to the door to usher out the recruits. ARYA and GENDRY look at each other and then begin to move.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: (yelling) Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MAN: Come on, move, move!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LOMMY is about to stand when he sees GENDRY's golden bull helmet. He picks it up.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	Gold Cloaks ride up to challenge the Night's Watch recruits. The recruits run out wildly, some with weapons and some without. One runs into a tall torch stuck in the ground and knocks it over, setting the grass on fire near the cage where the Night's Watch prisoners are being kept. The recruit scrambles away from the fire and runs off.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MAN #1: Gold Cloaks!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	MAN #2: Everyone out!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	PRISONER: Hey, you! Open the damn cage!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LOMMY picks up a piece of wood to use as a weapon and runs off.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN and a few other members of the Night's Watch approach the mounted Gold Cloaks, led by SER AMORY LORCH.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	AMORY: Where's the bastard, crow?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	AMORY: Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA and GENDRY watch from behind a bush.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: Now, which king would that be?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	AMORY: This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN looks around at the Gold Cloaks and spits.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: I don't think I will.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	AMORY: So be it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	A Gold Cloak shoots YOREN in the shoulder with a crossbow. He falls, but then rises in anger. ARYA tries to go to him but GENDRY holds her back.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN: I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	YOREN swings his sword and slashes the throat of a nearby Gold Cloak. He battles and takes down a few more of them before being subdued. ARYA gasps as she watches with GENDRY behind the bush. The Gold Cloaks hold YOREN up between their spears. AMORY LORCH rides over and pierces YOREN through the top of his head with his sword, killing him. The recruits rush out from behind the bushes, led by GENDRY. HOT PIE, however, stays behind.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JAQEN: Boy, come here. Boy! Sweet boy, help us.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The cage containing JAQEN H'GHAR, BITER, and RORGE is about to catch fire. ARYA pauses, unsure of what to do. The Gold Cloaks set upon the recruits in battle.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JAQEN: Come back here! Help us, boy! A man can fight! Free us!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA spies an ax and runs to retrieve it. She comes over to the cage.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	JAQEN: Quick, give it to me.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA hands JAQEN the ax, then runs back towards the fighting.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BITER: Give me the ax. Give me that.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	BITER and RORGE yank the ax away from JAQEN and begin trying to free themselves. JAQEN watches ARYA run back to the battle.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The fighting continues. HOT PIE watches from the bushes as GENDRY, who had been successfully fighting several Gold Cloaks, is overpowered and knocked out. The other recruits are similarly outmatched.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GOLD CLOAK #1: Put them on the wagon!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GOLD CLOAK #2: There's more here. Come on.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA tries to run from the encampment. POLLIVER, seeing her running up on the path, steps out of the darkness and hits her with the butt of his sword. ARYA falls to the ground.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER: What do we have here?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	He takes ARYA's sword as she lies gasping on the ground.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: No!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER: That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	HOT PIE is pushed forward by soldiers, encountering ARYA, who is still on the ground.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	HOT PIE: I yield! I yield!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARMORY: Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER: You heard him. You're coming with us.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER yanks ARYA up from the ground by her shoulder and pushes her forward. He pushes HOT PIE as well.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	HOT PIE: I yield!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The Gold Cloaks corral the remaining recruits and begin to march them back through the camp. They come across a wounded LOMMY with a crossbow bolt in his leg.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LOMMY: Help! Help me!
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The group stops walking and POLLIVER crosses over to LOMMY.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER: Something wrong with your leg, boy?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LOMMY: Look at it.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER reaches LOMMY and kneels next to him.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER: Can you walk?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	LOMMY: No. You got to carry me.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER: All right.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER extends his hand as if to help pull LOMMY up, but stabs the boy through the throat with Needle instead. LOMMY spits up blood and dies.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	POLLIVER: "Carry him," he says.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The Gold Cloaks laugh. ARYA is in shock at the murder of her friend. AMORY uses his sword to knock over the kneeling corpse of YOREN.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	AMORY: We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	No one says anything. Several recruits look down and subtly towards GENDRY, who looks at AMORY out of the corner of his eye and begins breathing heavily. ARYA looks around quickly and gets an idea.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: You want Gendry?
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	GENDRY subtly turns his head to stare at ARYA, nervous of her next move.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: You already got him.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA turns away from GENDRY to look over at LOMMY.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	ARYA: He loved that helmet.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	The camera pans over LOMMY to show GENDRY's golden bull helmet lying on the ground above the boy's head.
s02e03	What Is Dead May Never Die	Not finished. Feel free to work on it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. OUTSIDE OXCROSS
s02e04	Garden of Bones	Thunder rumbles through the darkness. It is raining at the gold cloak encampment. Two gold cloaks are arguing over who is the best fighter.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: If he ever gets out.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: Loras Tyrell?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	They laugh, and a horse neighs nervously.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: They get spooked by their own shadows.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: Shh. Do you hear that?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: No.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: There's something out there.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The soldiers both stand to investigate the darkness. They move forward cautiously, until RENNICK lets out a loud fart. GUARD #1 jumps, and RENNICK laughs raucously.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: I swear you pissed yourself. "Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: There is something out there.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: Yeah, don't even try me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: Rennick.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENNICK: Do you think I'm an idiot?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1: Rennick!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GUARD #1 draws his sword. A direwolf leaps from the darkness and attacks RENNICK. The camera focuses on KING ROBB STARK's face in the darkness as RENNICK screams. ROBB and his Northern men sit quietly on their horses, listening as a pack of wolves descends upon the Lannister men.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MAN: King in the North!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MEN: The King in the North!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD, THE NEXT MORNING
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The Northern forces have completed their assault on the encampment. The camera pans across bodies and wounded men in the mist. Horses neigh and soldiers cry out in pain. LORD ROOSE BOLTON and ROBB walk through the aftermath, followed by a handful of Northern soldiers.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROOSE BOLTON: Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROOSE BOLTON: Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: I doubt it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROOSE BOLTON: Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, "A naked man has few secrets. "A flayed man none."
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: My father outlawed flaying in the North.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROOSE BOLTON: We're not in the North.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: We're not torturing them.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROOSE BOLTON: The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOUNDED SOLDIER: No, don't! Don't! Please!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: Shhh.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	A WOUNDED SOLDIER struggles as TALISA removes his tattered pants and tries to tend to his bloody legs while another woman tries to help.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: The rot's set in.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOUNDED SOLDIER: No, don't! No, don't!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: Shh.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOUNDED SOLDIER: Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOUNDED SOLDIER: No, you can't!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB approaches, looking concerned as he struggles. ROBB kneels and holds the man down.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOUNDED SOLDIER: Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: You'll die if she doesn't.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOUNDED SOLDIER: I don't want to be a cripple, please.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROOSE BOLTON: Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: Your men are not my men, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOUNDED SOLDIER: No! You can't!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB holds the WOUNDED SOLDIER down as TALISA saws off his foot. He screams through the gag that ROBB placed in his mouth. ROBB watches the resigned TALISA saw through, impressed by her resolve.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD
s02e04	Garden of Bones	A mounted soldier rides slowly, carrying the Stark banner. TALISA readies a cart carrying a wounded man. It starts forward, and TALISA looks exhausted. ROBB looks over at her. She notices and turns. ROBB approaches.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: What's your name?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: Talisa.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: Your last name?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: You want to know what side my family fights on?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: That boy lost his foot on your orders.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: They killed my father.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: That boy did?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: The family he fights for.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: I have no hatred for the lad.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: That should help his foot grow back.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA walks away in frustration, carrying a heavy pail. ROBB follows.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: You're going to kill Joffrey?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: If the gods give me strength.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: And then what?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: So who will?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: First we have to win the war.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	Frustrated, TALISA climbs onto a horse's cart, and signals it to start off.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: You never told me where you're from.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: Volantis.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROBB: Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA: He was unlucky that you were.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TALISA rides away, and she and ROBB watch one another as she gets further and further away.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. KING'S LANDING
s02e04	Garden of Bones	INT. THRONE ROOM
s02e04	Garden of Bones	KING JOFFREY BARATHEON aims a crossbow at a kneeling LADY SANSA STARK while SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE stands by.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SANSA: Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SER LANCEL LANNISTER address the room, which is taken aback by his recounting.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Killing you would send your brother a message.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SANSA: (cries)
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SER MERYN TRANT approaches SANSA.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Leave her face. I like her pretty.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SANSA looks aghast at JOFFREY. MERYN punches her full-force in the stomach and she doubles over in pain. JOFFREY looks on cruelly as MERYN cuts SANSA's legs out from under her. She falls to the floor, wailing.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MERYN rips SANSA's dress from the back. She cries in anguish.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MERYN raises his sword to hit SANSA.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: What is the meaning of this?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MERYN holds, while LORD TYRION LANNISTER and BRONN enter the throne room. JOFFREY looks worried.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MERYN: The kind who serves his king, Imp.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	BRONN: Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: I'm punishing her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MERYN: No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MERYN stares daggers at TYRION. TYRION approaches SANSA and offers his hand. She takes it and stands. They walk out together.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SANSA: I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION watches SANSA walk out of the chamber, in admiration of her strength and clever response.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	BRONN: The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	BRONN: There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CUT TO: RED KEEP HALLWAY
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE HOUND stands in the hallway. JOFFREY enters.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: What are you doing here, dog?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOUND: Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: And? What is it?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOUND: Look inside, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	INT. JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY enters his chambers to find ROS and DAISY waiting for him.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAISY: Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS: Happy nameday, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: My nameday has passed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS: We won't tell if you won't.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	She moves to remove JOFFREY's pants. He rebuffs her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: No. Her. Touch her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS undresses DAISY, who stands upon a table. They both giggle, and the second prostitute begins to kiss and fondle the other's stomach. JOFFREY watches, intrigued.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Could you hit her?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	They giggle, and the first prostitute comes down to the floor and presents her ass. The second prostitute spanks her playfully.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: My uncle sent you?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAISY: Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS: Hmm.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY comes closer and presents his large belt to ROS.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Use this.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS hesitates, but takes it. She swings firmly, and DAISY reacts, surprised but still enjoying the pain.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Harder.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAISY looks worried. ROS hits her with more force, and DAISY cries in pain. ROS seems disgusted with herself. JOFFREY grabs her chin, roughly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS nods meekly. JOFFREY steps away. The spanking begins agian, harder than before. DAISY screams in pain. After multiple spankings, DAISY scrambles onto the bed, crying. Joffrey presents a mace to ROS, who takes it.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS: Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY cranks his crossbow. DAISY whimpers and shakes her head in fear. JOFFREY finishes setting the bow.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAISY: Please, Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ROS: Your Grace, if your uncle finds out
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY threatens her with the loaded crossbow. She pauses.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Begin.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAISY begins to cry, and then ROS commences the painful beating with the mace, and the other girl responds with screams of agony.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JOFFREY: Harder!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT: STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY's war camp is bustling. He walks up to LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH, who awaits him.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: I'm a practical man.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Just not a loyal one.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER's eyes shift to LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY takes an apple and sits down.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: I would give priority to my head.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: (snorts)
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY ponders LITTLEFINGER's implications.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CUT TO: RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER stands by a fire, warming himself. SER LORAS TYRELL and QUEEN MARGAERY TYRELL approach. LORAS peels off into a nearby tent while MARGAERY walks past LITTLEFINGER. He follows her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY: Lord Baelish.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY: It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: "Your tent"? Not "Our tent"? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY: I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY: The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY: You seem quite interested in our marriage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY: You've never married, have you?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY: That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MARGAERY walks away and LITTLEFINGER bows in respect, then ponders.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. OUTSIDE QARTH
s02e04	Garden of Bones	A lone horseman, KOVARRO, rides trots through the desert towards DAENERYS TARGARYEN, who looks lethargic and desperate.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: (Valerian) This isn't your horse.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	KOVARRO dismounts.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	KOVARRO: (Valerian) It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: (Valerian) Qarth?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	KOVARRO: (Valerian) Three days to the east, on the sea.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: (Valerian) Will they let us in?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	KOVARRO: (Valerian) They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS turns to SER JORAH MORMONT.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: What do you know of this place?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JORAH: Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. RIVERLANDS, OUTSIDE HARRENHAL
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LADY ARYA STARK, GENDRY, HOT PIE, and the other Night's Watch recruits are being led towards a misted, ruined Castle. There are groans and screams of pain as the recruits walk, their hands bound.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MAN #3: Go on!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MAN #4: You, keep moving!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MAN: Bring her about!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOT PIE: What kind of fire melts stone?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA: Dragonfire.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOT PIE: There's dragons here?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GENDRY: No, all the dragons are dead.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOT PIE: What's that smell?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA: Dead people.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SOLDIER: Move.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT
s02e04	Garden of Bones	Some prisoners are in chains. There are more screams of pain and the prisoners look dejected. Sounds of torture can be heard in the distance while ARYA, GENRY, and HOT PIE listen in horror.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MAN: Please, please, no, no! No.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	There is a cranking of chains, then a thud. The screaming stops.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOMAN: He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GENDRY: They take someone every day?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	WOMAN : (nods)
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA: Does anyone live?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The WOMAN does not answer, and ARYA looks down, hopelessly. She and GENDRY share a glance.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT: HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT
s02e04	Garden of Bones	It is nighttime and raining. ARYA lies in the mud.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.

s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN sits in her tent. LITTLEFINGER enters, and she rises.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: How dare you?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: You may have heard false reports.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: You betrayed Ned.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN:I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: No, my lady.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: Get out!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN draws a knife, threateningly. LITTLEFINGER pauses, thinking.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: Have you lost your mind? Get out!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: You have Arya, too?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN ponders, then lowers the knife and places it down.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: What do you want?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: You think I keep secrets from my son?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	Two servants enter and place down something heavy.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: Good faith?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The servants bow and leave. CATELYN looks at LITTLEFINGER and her face goes ashen as she realizes what is in the chest before her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: What's this?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN kneels slowly over the chest and opens it. She looks down, sadly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LITTLEFINGER: Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: Get out.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	Speechless, LITTLEFINGER leaves. CATELYN begins to cry. She slams the chest closed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT: HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA sleeps on the cold, wet ground. Soldiers wake up the prisoners with banging and shouting.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MAN: Get up, you dogs!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The recruits stand up as the soldiers move through the camp. SER GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE strides into camp.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOT PIE: That's him, the one who picks.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA: The Mountain. What are you doing?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOT PIE: He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE MOUNTAIN looks over the crowd. Most people look down, but HOT PIE meets his gaze, as does another PRISONER. The MOUNTAIN picks that PRISONER.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MOUNTAIN: You.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SOLDIER: Move, boy! Move!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	HOT PIE is shocked and pisses himself for having listened to the other man.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. HARRENHAL, TORTURE AREA
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The PRISONER is strapped into a chair, his neck and extremities bound. Panic fills his eyes as they tighten the straps and THE TICKLER begins his inquisition.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Is there gold and silver in the village?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Gems?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I didn't see any.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER gives permission to begin the torture. A soldier pulls out a squealing rat and places it into a bucket. The PRISONER's panic rises.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I don't know. Please.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The soldier attaches the bucket to the PRISONER's chest.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Which of the villagers aided them?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER:I don't know.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Who?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER nods to the soldier, who pulls a flaming torch out of the fire.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Who?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The rat start to chew on the PRISONER's chest. His eyes widen in pain and panic.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER:  Who?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Who helped him?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER:  Ganes, the butcher,  and his son.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER:  That's better. You've been very helpful.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	PRISONER: No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The soldier holds the flame to the bucket, and the rat trapped inside shrieks in constant fear.

s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY's bannermen sit astride their horses on a cliffside, next to the sea. A strong wind blows. The camera zooms in to show a meeting of the Baratheon Brothers: RENLY, CATELYN, LORAS, and BRIENNE facing KING STANNIS BARATHEON, SER DAVOS SEAWORTH, and MELISANDRE
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Can that truly be you?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Who else might it be?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: My own.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Watch yourself, Renly.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lord's chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: That's twice I've warned you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CATELYN: We share a common enemy.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY quickly considers the offer.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS and his party ride off.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY: Would you believe I loved him once?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	RENLY spurs his mount and his party heads in the opposite direction.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. THE GATES OF QARTH
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS and her Dothraki sit outside the gates of Qarth. The gates are closed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: I thought we were welcome.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JORAH: If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: Horde?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	Qartheen soldiers line up outside the gate, at attention. A group of thirteen emissaries from the city walk forward from the gates. The plump SPICE KING leads the group.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: My name is Daenerys-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: You know me, my lord?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: And what should I call you?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS:  The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING Qarth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS:  Qarth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Might we see the dragons?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS looks back to the woven chest that holds the dragons on top of one of their horses. She is nervous and a bit desperate.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: I am not a liar.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The SPICE KING turns and walks away. DAENERYS steps follows with indignation, and he turns back around.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: We have received you. Here we are, and here you are.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: If you do not let us in, all of us will die.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The SPICE KING continues to the rest of the thirteen, and they begin their walk back into Qarth.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	JORAH: Khaleesi, please be careful.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS finds her resolve and steps forward. The soldiers react by leaning their spears forward in unison, clearly a warning.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS: Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The SPICE KING steps forward from the thirteen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO XHOAN DAXOS steps out from the back of the Thirteen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO: Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO: I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO: Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAENERYS recognizes that XARO is a potential ally, but the SPICE KING remains resolute.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Our decision is final.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO: Very well. I invoke soumai.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The Thirteen react, looking between themselves. XARO draws his dagger, pointing downward and grabs the blade with his left hand. DAENERYS looks to JORAH for council.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO: I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO pulls the dagger up, slicing his palm deeply. He displays the wound to the Thirteen.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	SPICE KING: Be it on your head.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	XARO: Welcome to Qarth, my lady.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The SPICE KING rejoins the Thirteen in frustration. XARO gestures a welcome to DAENERYS, and the gates open, noisily. DAENERYS and JORAH share a glance before the Dothraki band walk through the city gates. XARO joins her side.

s02e04	Garden of Bones	GRENDRY and ARYA look at one another in panic. Soldiers grab GENDRY and he is bound in the torture chair.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Is there gold or silver in the village?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GENDRY: I'm not from the village.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER: Where is the Brotherhood?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE TICKLER sits, facing GENDRY while his soldier stands menacingly at his side.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GENDRY: I don't know what that is.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA stares. THE TICKLER nods to his helper to take action. The camera pans across the sullen crowd, including ARYA and HOT PIE. The soldier places a rat in a bucket and straps it to GENDRY'S chest.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	CUT TO: HARRENHAL, COURTYARD
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LORD TYWIN LANNISTER rides in, astride a white horse and flanked by gold coats. He looks around in disappointment. He is greeted by THE MOUNTAIN.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MAN: You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYWIN: What's this?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYWIN dismounts while a soldiers takes the reigns of his horse. He then walks forward, inspecting the prisoners and their condition.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE MOUNTAIN: We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYWIN: Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE MOUNTAIN: Cells are overflowing, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	POLLIVER: This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYWIN: Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	He gets no response. TYWIN continues to inspect the prisoners, and addresses GENDRY.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYWIN: You, do you have a trade?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA sits, expressionless, trying not to be noticed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	GENDRY: Smith, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	POLLIVER notices ARYA's attention and feels slighted. He draws his sword to threaten her.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	POLLIVER: What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA backs away, and TYWIN intervenes.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYWIN: He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	ARYA: Safer to travel, my lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYWIN: Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	THE MOUNTAIN: My lord.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT.KING'S LANDING
s02e04	Garden of Bones	INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION answers the knocking on his door to find LANCEL LANNISTER.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Your visits are too few, cousin.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL extends a scroll to TYRION, who takes it, unimpressed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION:  So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION steps into his chamber and pours himself a cup of wine.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL moves to leave, but TYRION does not let him.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: As I said several times.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION ponders the scroll, while LANCEL stands over his desk, annoyed.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL thinks carefully before responding.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	As TYRION walks past LANCEL, he catches a familiar aroma.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: I am a knight!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL sits and chokes out some frustration.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: It's not my fault!
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: I only meant I did as I was bid.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION moves to leave the chamber to fetch JOFFREY. LANCEL falls to his knees and begs.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: No, I think not.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: My lord?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION claps in celebration.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: But her demands?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	LANCEL: You will?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION: Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	TYRION shuts the chamber door. LANCEL leans against the wall, feeling beaten.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT
s02e04	Garden of Bones	A boat with a stag figurehead rocks on the calm seas. DAVOS approaches STANNIS on the deck.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Your Grace.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Fewer.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Pardon?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Does he listen?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: I've lived within the law for seventeen-
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: I want you to be a smuggler this time.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	STANNIS: Cleaner ways don't win wars.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS nods and walks away. STANNIS stares into the distance.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	EXT. STORMLANDS, SHORELINE
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS rows a boat into the shallows. MELISANDRE sits patiently.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE:  You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE:  If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: And which are you?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Well, that must be very nice for you.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS stows the oars and enters the water to lead the boat to shore. He pulls it onto the shore.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: Do you love your wife?
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: I do.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE:  Yet you have known other women.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Don't talk about my wife.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS secures the boat on the shore.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE:  I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS does not respond.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE:  And you will.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE turns to grab something from the boat.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	INT. A CAVE
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS leads MELISANDRE through the cave, bearing a lantern.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS holds up the lantern to bars that obstruct their way.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: They can't bar our passage.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE has disrobed, arms outstretched, revealing a swollen, fully pregnant belly. DAVOS is shocked at this sudden change.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	DAVOS: Gods protect us.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	MELISANDRE: There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.
s02e04	Garden of Bones	The lantern flares suddenly, surprising DAVOS, who retreats. MELISANDRE sits down behind him, and assumes a birthing position. She moans in pain as she gives birth. DAVOS watches in apprehension. MELISANDRE screams, and a foul spirit crawls from between her legs. It gathers strength and roars as it expands and takes to the air.

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT. SHADOWLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The camp is alive with activity, in spite of the late hour. Soldiers move in every direction.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	INT. RENLY'S TENT
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	KING RENLY BARATHEON and LADY CATELYN STARK are seated across from one another while LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH stands at guard.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY: You swear it?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY takes a long sip of wine.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY: Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: And the wording of this oath?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY: The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN considers these terms.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: And in return for my son's loyalty?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY: In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY stands.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY: When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY walks across the tent. BRIENNE removes his cloak.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY: Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE continues to remove RENLY's armor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RENLY: Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The wind howls, and a dark cloud of mist races into the tent. CATELYN watches it cross the floor. BRIENNE gasps as a dark spirit takes form from the mist, rising up behind RENLY. The dark spirit stabs RENLY in the back, through the heart. RENLY gasps and the spirit hisses.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: No! No.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The dark spirit dissipates into a wind as RENLY starts to collaps. BRIENNE lunges forward to catch him and lowers him gently to the ground. Two soldiers leap into the room and draw their swords, believing BRIENNE to have assassinated their king.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SOLDIER #1: Follow me!
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SOLDIER #2: (to BRIENNE) You'll die for this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: No, wait, it wasn't her!
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The soldiers rush past CATELYN to engage with BRIENNE, who meets them in battle. She quickly dispatches one of the soldiers. The second soldiers falls soon after, with BRIENNE plunging her sword down his spine. CATELYN stares while BRIENNE looks upon RENLY's corpse. She staggers and falls to her knees, sobbing over his lifeless body. CATELYN comes beside her to comfort her.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN #1: Inside the king's tent - go
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN #2: Now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: I won't leave him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: You can't avenge him if you're dead.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN: Over there, go!
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE gets up to leave. CATELYN tries to pull her to the front door. BRIENNE resists.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: Not that way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE exits past a tapestry. CATELYN follows.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT: THE STORMLANDS SHORE
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	KING STANNIS BARATHEON's boats sit off the coast. LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH takes them in, then walks towards the camp as soldiers rush by in disorder.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	INT. RENLY'S TENT
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SER LORAS TYRELL mournfully kneels beside RENLY's body. LADY MARGAERY TYRELL paces in the background.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: We need to go home. Loras.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER enters the tent, just short of a panic.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: My lord, my lady.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORAS: Get out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORAS: And you want that privilege for yourself.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: There's no time for this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORAS: Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORAS: I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORAS: I will put a sword through his righteous face.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: You can't stay here.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORAS: He would have been a true king, a good king.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORAS: Revenge.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY moves to LORAS's side and caresses his hair. LORAS stands with a grimace. He picks up his sword and leaves. MARGAERY looks upon RENLY's corpse.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: He was very handsome.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: He was, Your Grace.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: "Your Grace." Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LITTLEFINGER: Do you want to be a queen?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY: No. I want to be the queen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MARGAERY turns and faces LITTLEFINGER, resolute.

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	Three noble girls play blind man's bluff in a garden while a septa stands by. QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER watches from a window above
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	INT. TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: Killed? By whom?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORD TYRION LANNISTER picks up a goblet.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: Really? Who'd have thought?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION pours himself some wine.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: Whomever did it, I say well done.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI finishes pouring her own wine.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: She'll be safer in Dorne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI walks past TYRION and sits.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: It's important that we talk about this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CERSEI: It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION exits in frustration, while CERSEI takes a sip, enjoying the upper hand.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT. THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN stands waiting among the bustling cityfolk next to a small tent, where TYRION and SER LANCEL LANNISTER meet in secret.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: It's wildfire.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: No.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION:MThat's a lie right there.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: I'm telling you the truth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: The smart money would be on more likely.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: She's making wildfire.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: I suppose there's only one way to find out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: When did she tell you this?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Swear to me on what?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: On my life.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: But I don't care about your life.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION pushes LANCEL out of the small tent. LANCEL falls to the ground, grunting.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LANCEL: Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: It will be my pleasure.

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS's forces have landed at RENLY's camp. SER DAVOS SEAWORTH meets STANNIS as he enters the main courtyard, and they move through the compound at rapid pace.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: Your Grace.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: What is it?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: Your Grace, I-
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	They reach RENLY's tent.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: You've come to lecture me on truth?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: I've come to tell you that what I saw.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: I'll hear no more about it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS stands over the war map.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN: Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: When do we sail for King's Landing?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: That's not your concern.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: Loyal service means telling hard truths.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: What do you believe?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS: Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	STANNIS: Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAVOS exits.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT. KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	A girl grabs a fish from a bucket.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GIRL: I've got it! I've got it!
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN: So it's that one there at the top, on the right.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN #2: Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The lord is revealed to be TYRION, with BRONN walking behind him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	They come upon a crowd listening to a rabblerouser.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PROTESTER: Corruption.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CROWD: Yes!
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PROTESTER: We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: It's hard to argue with his assessment.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: Not after what he did to your birthday present.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN: A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: You have to admire his imagination.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: He's talking about you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: What? Demon monkey?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: You don't need to convince me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: Demon monkey.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT: IRON ISLANDS, MORNING
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LORD THEON GREYJOY walks up a dock dressed in armor. He gazes on a ship and smiles. The crew walks up noisily.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	MAN: Yeah, come on.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The crew ignores THEON.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BLACK LORREN: Where are we headed, Captain?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BLACK LORREN: And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: I do. Your captain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BLACK LORREN stands directly in front of THEON, challenging him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BLACK LORREN: I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BLACK LORREN walks away down the steps to the dock.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BLACK LORREN: (laughs)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LADY YARA GREYJOY enters.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	YARA: Stop. We yield.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The Ironborn laugh
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	YARA: Congratulations on your first command.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	YARA: Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	YARA: That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON's crew pushes off from the dock. They row away without him, laughing. DAGMER enters.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAGMER: Come on, I'll take you out.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: Who are you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAGMER: Dagmer, your first mate.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAGMER: They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAGMER: You're not.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAGMER: They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON follows DAGMER onto a dock, where he attends to a boat.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAGMER: The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON:  No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON pauses and the idea of how to take advantage of the betrayal comes to full. He laughs, and DAGMER smiles back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	THEON: Take me to my ship.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	INT. HARRENHAL
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	While ARYA prepares food, LORD TYWIN LANNISTER presides over his war council.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	REGINALD: The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	AMORY: Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	REGINALD: We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	REGINALD: My wife's in Lannisport.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	REGINALD LANNISTER rises, in scared disbelief.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	REGINALD exits. ARYA comes to TYWIN's side to pour him some wine. He stops her.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: Maidenpool, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: House Mooton, my lord.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: And what is their sigil?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA does not answer, she does not know.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: (nods)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: Good. One more time, where are you from?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: They call him the Young Wolf.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: And?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: And do you believe them?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: No, my lord. Anyone can be killed.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	They stare at one another, unblinking.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYWIN: Fetch that water.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA exits.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT. HARRENHAL
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	Arya walks to fetch water. She turns a corner and sees JAQEN H'GHAR coming towards her, dressed as a gold cloak. She lowers her head, trying to be unnoticed. They pass and she continues. She enters the catacombs and passes a helmet. She realizes that JAQEN has forgotten it, and that he might return. Indeed, JAQEN turns the corner, walking slowly.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: A girl says nothing.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: (gasps)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: I was always a girl.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA picks up the helmet and thrusts it into JAQEN's hands.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: I didn't have a choice.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: You did. I did. And here we are.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA fills her water pitcher, and steps back as JAQEN approaches her.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: Three what?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: A man has said.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: The one who tortures everyone.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: A man needs a name.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JAQEN: That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA exits quickly.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CUT TO: THE NORTH
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	Some men pull a large sled. The Night's Watch marches in single file.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: When will he come?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: The Halfhand does things in his own time.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: My uncle told me stories about him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: Most of them are true.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: Well, possible for the Halfhand.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SAM: Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SAM: The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DOLOROUS EDD: Before I die, please, stop talking.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SAM: Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DOLOROUS EDD: Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GRENN: (laughs)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	A horn sounds, and the men pause from their labor to see what is going on.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GRENN: Wildlings?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DOLOROUS EDD: So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SAM: And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GRENN: But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. "
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE: Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION hands the pot to HAYLENE, happy to give over the foul alchemy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE: After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: (scoffs)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: My companion takes issue.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE: Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: To do what?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE: The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: How much do you have?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE starts to lead the others through a door and darker catacombs. TYRION and BRONN follow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE: My lord, this man is insulting.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: My friend remains unconvinced.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE: He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE forces open an ancient door. They enter a storeroom. TYRION is amazed at how much wildfire they have produced.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HAYLENE: We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRONN: This is a shit idea.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	TYRION: I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me.

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	IRRI: (Dothraki) May he ride forever through the night lands.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DOREAH: (chuckles) You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	IRRI: She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	All three are quiet in the awkward moment.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	IRRI: You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	IRRI exits.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT. QARTH, GARDEN PARTY
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS mingles during an elegant garden party.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	WOMAN: And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: It sounds wonderful.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	WOMAN: The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: Please excuse me for a moment.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS joins SER JORAH MORMONT, who is speaking with two Dothraki.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: (speaks Dothraki)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: What are they doing?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	KOVARRO: (Dothraki) Or melt it. Very simple.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: (Dothraki)  We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	KOVARRO: (Dothraki) Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: (Dothraki) Not even when we leave.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	KOVARRO: (Dothraki) Why not?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: (Dothraki) Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	KOVARRO and MALAKKO exit. KOVARRO steals a goblet along the way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PYATT PREE approaches them and bows.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PYATT PREE: Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PYATT PREE offers his hand and DAENERYS takes it. He places a gem in her palm.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PYATT PREE: Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PYATT PREE looks over his shoulder to his own doppelganger, who stands motionless. The crowd gasps.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PYATT PREE: Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	PYATT PREE and his twin both leave. The crowd applauds at the illusion. XARO comes to DAENERYS's side from the crowd.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: What is the House of the Undying?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO leads DAENERYS away, leaving JORAH behind. QUAITHE, a masked woman, talks to JORAH.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QUAITHE: You watch over her.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: Do I know you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QUAITHE: I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: Who are you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QUAITHE: I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QUAITHE leaves.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CUT TO: STORMLANDS, WOODS
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE and CATELYN stand next to a stream, having stopped to water their horses.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: It looked like Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: In the shape of Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN is unsure.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN:  We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: Will you stay there long, my lady?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: I never knew my mother.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: I'm sorry.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN walks to the fire and sits. BRIENNE follows.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: It's a bloody business.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: What comes after is even harder.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: You mean to kill Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: I swore a vow.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: I only held him that once as he was dying.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN stands and faces BRIENNE.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN: When the time comes, I will not hold you back.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE draws her sword and kneels to pledge her loyalty.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRIENNE: Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CATELYN:  I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	INT. WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RICKON STARK cracks nuts while LORD BRAN STARK receives visitors. MAESTER LUWIN sits at his side.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	WINTERFELL SHEPHERD: And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	WINTERFELL SHEPHERD: My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The WINTERFELL SHEPHERD leaves.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: (to RICKON) Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LUWIN: Good.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: Hodor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HODOR: Hodor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SER RODRIK CASSEL enters.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RODRIK: Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LUWIN: Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RODRIK: Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: We have to help them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RODRIK: Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	LUWIN: Do you need so many?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RODRIK: Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	RODRIK exits with his entourage.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	HODOR carries BRAN through the courtyard. OSHA walks beside him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: So, what does it mean?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: Must not mean anything, then.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: You're lying.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: You know what it means.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: I never said I didn't.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: You didn't give me an honest answer.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: That's not the same as being a liar.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: Well, it's not far off.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN doesn't answer.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: Something bad? Tell me, boy.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: The sea is hundreds of miles away.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: I know. It's just a stupid dream.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	BRAN: Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA: They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	OSHA exits.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	CUT TO: NORTH OF THE WALL
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	A winter storm howls as the Knight's Watchmen persevere.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: There.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: Where?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: On that mountain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SAM: I don't see very well.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: A fire.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: How many wildlings have joined him?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON:  Where?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: We need to get rid of those lookouts.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JON: I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN:  He's the one?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	QHORIN: Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	SAM: I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JEOR: Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	EXT. QARTH, GARDEN
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	The garden party has continued into the night.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: And what about what a woman wants?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: Why?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: Ah, a conqueror.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: (chuckles)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: I will show you why.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	He leads her away.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	INT. XARO'S VAULT.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO strikes the door of the vault with a sword.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: And behind the door?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: (chuckles)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: And it can all be mine?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: All I have to do?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: Is marry me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: That was a romantic proposal.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS thinks about his proposition.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	XARO: See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	INT. QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: The usurper is dead.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: (laughs)
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: I only want-
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS:  What do you want? Tell me.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: To see you on the Iron Throne.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS:  Why?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: So what would you have me do, as my advisor?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: And how do I get the ship?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	DAENERYS: I look forward to meeting him.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	JORAH: Khaleesi.

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GENDRY: Sideface?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: Sideways.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GENDRY: Why?

s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GENDRY: Am I fighting someone?
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA: You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	A loud thud is heard, and a woman screams off camera. ARYA rushes over to gold cloaks who surround a prone body.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GOLD CLOAK: Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA looks down upon the twisted body of THETICKLER. She looks up.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	GOLD CLOAK: Go up the battlement.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	WOMAN: That is strange.
s02e05	The Ghost of Harrenhal	ARYA spies JAQEN standing in the battlement above. He touches a finger beneath his eye. ARYA understands the gesture.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: To take the castle.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: You went with Robb.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: I don't know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Find the halfwit.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAGMER: (nods)
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: Why?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: I won't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Yes, you will.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON moves closer to BRAN, who pulls himself up by a rope, hung from the ceiling.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON sits next to BRAN on the bed.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON gets up to leave.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN addresses a crow, sitting next to THEON. DAGMER, LUWIN, HODOR, and RICKON STARK stand watching.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Louder. Say Prince Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	FARLEN: Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: Farlen, you be silent.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: All of you should do as he commands.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	FARLEN: Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	An Ironborn clubs FARLEN over the head. He screams and stumbles to the ground.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	IRONBORN: Shut up!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LUWIN: I am.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LUWIN: My lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LUWIN exits, resigned. OSHA comes forward from the crowd.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: My Lord Greyjoy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: You were here the day I was taken.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: I'm the one who took you. What of it?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA kneels.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: Let me serve you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA rises and brushes past THEON.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: Step aside.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: Why?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BLACK LORREN: Greyjoy!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BLACK LORREN and another Ironborn bring a captive, bound, and bloodied SER RODRIK CASSEL into the courtyard.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BLACK LORREN: We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: They are not my people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: King Robb thought of you as a brother.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: If he were alive to see this
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK spits in THEON's face. The Ironborn wrestle him to the ground.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Take him to the cells. Lock him up
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAGMER: My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAGMER: No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON considers and RODRIK fumes, on his knees. THEON looks at BRAN.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LUWIN: I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LUWIN: He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON considers, but DAGMER gives a quick shake of his head.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAGMER: Come.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BLACK LORREN and a second Iron Born pull RODRIK up. DAGMER draws his sword and steps across the courtyard. They follow, with RODRIK resisting.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The Ironborn hold RODRIK in front of THEON and DAGMER. DAGMER is stands ready to execute RODRIK
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: I'm begging you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: Coward.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK is forced to his knees and THEON draws his sword in a wide arc.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: You don't give commands anymore, little lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: Please, stop this. Please stop him.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	It starts to rain and Theon breathes heavily, his eyes wild. He holds his sword to the back of RODRIK's neck.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Any last words, old man?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RODRIK: Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: Theon, please don't.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	RICKON: Do something!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	BRAN: I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON swings his sword down onto RODRIK's neck, but not hard enough to decapitate him. RODRIK spits up blood, suffering. Enraged, THEON swings three more times, then kicks RODRIK's severed head away. THEON pants while BRAN wails.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GHOST plods ahead of the Night's Watchmen.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: There goes your pet.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: He's not a pet.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: Ghost is different.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: We could do the same.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: My father always said I'm of the North.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: (laughs)
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: I wasn't joking.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: (nods)
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: I'll gladly give my life.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: I do.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GHOST walks behind the men. JON moves to catch up.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	INT: HARRENHAL
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LORD TYWIN LANNISTER meets with his war council. LADY ARYA STARK comes in to serve wine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Can you read?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: My lord?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Can you read?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY stares blankly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: My apologies, my lord. I must have-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA picks up the correct volume right away and brings it to the table. TYWIN chuckes and stands.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: My cupbearer can read better than you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN opens the book
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARMORY: My lord, I-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY stands and leaves.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	There is a knock on the door and a Kingsguard enters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Lord Petyr Baelish.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Mmm. Give us the room.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The war council leaves.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: (to Arya) Clear all this.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH enters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: Lord Tywin.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: (not amused) Baelish.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA continues to clear the table.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Wine?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: Thank you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	They sit at the table. ARYA takes a deep breath. She does not want LITTLEFINGER to recognize her but she must also attend to TYWIN without raising his suspicions.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: What news from the capital?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA serves wine to LITTLEFINGER, who raises his glass to his lips. ARYA tries to walk away from the table, but TYWIN stops her and hands her more to clear.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN:  Yes, yes, yes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Wants to be queen.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: Yes, she does.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: (to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA continues to move so that LITTLEFINGER cannot see her face clearly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN: The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: They have.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA spills some wine, and tries to mop it up in a panic.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Pardon, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: It's only wine.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER tries to look at ARYA's face, but TYWIN pulls his attention away.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: You would ride there yourself?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: Tonight, with your leave.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA steps away from the table but continues to listen as she walks away.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: And what else?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Why?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LITTLEFINGER: He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Hmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON, QHORIN, and the party of Night's Watchmen creep among rocks and snow of a mountaintop, stalking a wildling camp by a fire. The wildlings are tending to their duties. QHORIN signals and one of the Night's Watchmen lets loose an arrow, striking a wildling in the chest. A short skirmish ensues. JON grapples a hooded wildling into submission, after preventing her from grabbing a weapon. Her hood falls away to reveal YGRITTE, panting. JON is shocked.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: A girl.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: A wildling.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: We could question her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: What's your name?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Ygritte.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN picks up the axe that YGRITTE was reaching for.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN throws the axe down to emphasize his point.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: I gave you my name.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: I'm Jon Snow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON stands back but keeps his blade trained on YGRITTE's face. She looks at the fallen wildlings.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: You ought to burn them you killed.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: The Free Folk.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: How many?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE doesn't answer. She locks eyes with JON.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: Do you mean to march on the Wall?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN leans down closely and places his hand on YGRITTE's face.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: Do you know who I am, girl?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Qhorin Halfhand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN nods and stands back.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN draws his sword.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: No. No, I'll do it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN: Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QHORIN and the Watchmen exit. JON points his sword at YGRITTE's face, who still lays still on the rocks. He hesitates.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON pushed the point of his sword into her chin to quiet her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: I'm as much a crow as they are.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE rolls onto her stomach, accepting her fate. JON positions his sword above the back of her neck.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Will you burn me? After?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE pulls her hood back in frustration. She wants a clean death. JON rests the sword on the back of her neck.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON continues to hesitate.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Go on. Be quick about it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON pulls the sword away. YGRITTE looks at him in frustration.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Do it. Bastard, do it!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON brings his sword over his head and strikes downward, hitting the rock in front of YGRITTE's head. She looks at the blade before her face, and realizes that JON cannot bring himself to kill her. They look at one another and she seizes her chance. She slams a rock into JON's knee and he falls. She runs, putting her hood back on. JON pursues her as she runs down the mountainside. Both are desperate. JON can't seem to catch up, but he spies an opportunity to shortcut the fleeing YGRITTE. He takes another route, and slides down a hill to tackle YGRITTE. He drops his sword in the process, but pulls out a knife, and places at her throat.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: You can't do it. We both know it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON turns her over and stands above her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: I'll find them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	In a skiff crowded with people, PRINCESS MYRCELLA BARATHEON sits down, looking back at the shore. The HIGH SEPTON blesses her travels.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	HIGH SEPTON: May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER and LORD TYRION LANNISTER watch the boat depart.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CERSEI: One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION turns to face her. CERSEI continues to look straight ahead. He walks away, silently.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CUT TO: KING JOFFREY BARATHEON, LADY SANSA STARK, PRINCE TOMMEN BARATHEON, and SER MERYN TRANT watching in the crowd. TOMMEN is crying.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: I saw you cry.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: Did you say something, my lady?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: So?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: It seems a normal thing.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: Is your little brother a prince?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: No.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY leaves, followed by SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE. They walk past CERSEI on their way out. She still stares after the skiff.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	EXT: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY walks through the crowd, among his Kingsguard. TYRION and TOMMEN are with him. The crowd begins to hassle JOFFREY.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #2: Murderer! Bastard!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #3: All hail the King.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #4: He's no king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #5: He's a bastard!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #6:Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #7: Freak.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION turns to one of the guards.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	Some of the guards escort TOMMEN away, hopefully to safety.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	WOMAN: Please, Your Grace, give us some food!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: Bread, Your Grace, please!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY ignores them, until he is hit in the face with a mudball. He groans and doubles over. THE HOUND and the other Kingsguard draw their swords to defend the king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE HOUND holds JOFFREY back, trying to control him.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Hold on!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD #2: Hold them back!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The Kingsguard push into the crowd. A full riot begins. SANSA and her handmaidens are scared.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: Just kill them! Kill them all!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CERSEI looks back at TYRION
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION:  Move. Move!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE HOUND grabs JOFFREY around the chest and guides him forward.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Pull back!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: Tear him to pieces!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: What are you doing? I want these people executed!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE HOUND: And they want the same for you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The riot escalates. SANSA flees awkwardly. TYRION watches in horror as the crowd tears one of their party limb from limb. The crowd cheers.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: Where's Sansa?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Through the door.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD #2: Come on.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD #3: Push hard.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The crowd closes around them. MERYN strikes down one of the crowd.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MERYN: Protect the king!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Get back!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD #2: Fall back! Keep him safe!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE Hound passes JOFFREY off to MERYN and sets on the crowd. Meanwhile, the Kingsguard shepherd Joffrey through a gate.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Come in! Come in!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CUARD #2: Keep him safe!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CROWD: Motherfucker! Brotherfucker!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: Watch out. Hold them back.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD #2: Come on.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA is trapped by the crowd. She runs down a dark passage, and some men from the crowd follow.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: Hey.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	INT: RED KEEP HALLWAY
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY and his guards are now safely away from the crowd, which can still be heard on the other side of the wall.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: Traitors! I'll have all their heads.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: Oh, you blind, bloody fool!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: You can't insult me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: You can't-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: I can, I am.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: They attacked me!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: You're talking to a king!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION slaps him.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JOFFREY: Let them have her!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING, INTERIOR
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA runs in desperation from the men who pursue her. One catches up grabs her arm. She slaps him and he hits her in return. She spins to the ground. Two other men catch up. They tear at her clothes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: Where are you going?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #2:You ever been fucked, little girl?  Come here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CUT TO: RED KEEP HALLWAY
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MERYN: I take my orders from the king.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: Where? This way.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING INTERIOR
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The three men drag SANSA across the floor. She fights back but there are too many of them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: Please! No! No!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The men continue their assault. One holds down her hands while the others tear at her clothes. THE HOUND appears and guts one of them, holding him by the neck before dropping him to the floor. He takes care of the rest. SANSA lies on the ground, terrified and whimpering.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: Please!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE HOUND reaches down to help SANSA up.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE HOUND: You're all right now, little bird. You're all right.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	She accepts his help and he carries her away, slung over his shoulder.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CUT TO: THE RIOT
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The melee continues. It has spiraled further out of control.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CUT TO: RED KEEP INTERIOR
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE HOUND carries SANSA past TYRION and into safety with the rest of the royal party. He sets her down gently, with her back to the wall.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN: We'll get you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #2:  We'll get you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	MAN #3: This way.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: Are you hurt, my lady?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THE HOUND: The little bird's bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYRION: Well done, Clegane.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	HOUND: I didn't do it for you.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS paces while XARO watches. KOVARRO sits nearby.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: He shouldn't make me wait.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO: The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: I already have a husband.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO: Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO: I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: The Mother of Dragons!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO: Ah, here he comes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The SPICE KING enters, descending a staircase with his entourage.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The SPICE KING descends the staircase.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO: Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: My father sat there, before he was murdered.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say "take the Iron Throne"?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: I didn't come here to argue grammar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: Not yet.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: There are many there that support my claim.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: When were you there last?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: I left when I was a baby.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: So, in truth, you have no allies.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: A shrewd man.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS ascends the stairs to meet the SPICE KING.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	The SPICE KING ascends the staircase to leave. His entourage follows.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SPICE KING: Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA comes to clean the table. She notices the scroll, which mentions KING ROBB STARK, and begins to read it. TYWIN enters, catching her in the act.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Who taught you to read?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: My father, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: A stonemason.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TWYIN: A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: He taught himself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Quite a man. What killed him?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Loyalty.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: No. But you've already begun.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Did you know your father, my lord?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN sits. While his back is turned, ARYA steals the scroll that she was reading.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TYWIN: Mmm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA exits.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA hides in a corner, above the bustle of the courtyard. She pulls out the scroll to read what it says about ROBB. She gets up with purpose.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	INT: HARRENHAL
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA runs down the steps. Not looking where she is going, she runs into AMORY LORCH
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: Where are you going, girl?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: The armory, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: Why?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Lord Tywin sent me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: What might this be?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Lord Tywin gave it to me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: What for?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: To take to the armory.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA flees and AMORY pursues her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AMORY: Move! Get out of the way!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA scampers through the courtyard and he follows clumsily. AMORY loses sight of her, and she stays hidden out of sight just beyond a doorway. AMORY goes the wrong way, and she takes advantage of his mistake and runs the other way. She encounters a Kingsguard who she mistakes for JAQEN. She grabs him for attention. He turns to her, and she realizes her mistake. She continues on and finds JAQEN just a bit further on.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Amory Lorch.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JAQEN: A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: Now!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JAQEN: A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ARYA: But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SOLDIER #3: My honor, Your Grace.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	QUENT: Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Quent.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB sees TALISA sitting by a tent. He approaches her.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Lady Talisa.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Because it's obvious.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: I'd call you a liar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: (nods)
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Better at amputations, I'm afraid.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	They look around, awkwardly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Quite a pretty spot.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: Will we be here long?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: I'm not a spy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. "The Young Wolf is on the move. "
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LADY CATELYN STARK approaches with LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: Robb.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB turns to CATELYN and embraces her. TALISA looks down.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYIN: Lady Talisa.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: Lady Stark.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: Lady Talisa...?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: Maegyr.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA: An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	TALISA exits. ROBB watches her go. CATELYN looks knowingly at her son, a wry smile on her face. The two of them begin to walk.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: I've missed you.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: Yes, you look positively forlorn.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: I know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: I know.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: A debt that must be paid.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: I haven't forgotten.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	LORD ROOSE BOLTON enters
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE BOLTON: Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE BOLTON holds up a scroll.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON and YGRITTE walk through the mountains. Her hands are bound and he leads her by a rope.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Here? There's no shelter here.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: There's no shelter anywhere.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: No fire.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: But a fire is-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: No fire.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Have it your way.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON forces YGRITTE to lie down. He begins to walk away.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON pauses.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE turns to sleep. JON looks back at her, then joins her, reluctantly.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Think they're out looking for you?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: Yes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Think they'll find you?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: Yes.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: You're brave. Stupid, but brave.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	They are both exhausted.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE wiggles next to JON.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: Stop moving.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: I'm just trying to get comfortable.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: Stop it!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	She begins moving again.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	JON: You're still moving.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	YGRITTE: Was I? I didn't notice that time.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	INT: ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB, CATELYN, and ROOSE BOLTON are in the midst of a discussion.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: This cannot be true.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE: We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Why? Why would Theon-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE: Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: My brothers?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE:  We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: I must go north at once.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE: There's still a war to win, Your Grace.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE: You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	CATELYN: Let me go and talk to Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: There will be no talk. He will die for this.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROOSE: Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	ROBB: Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	INT: WINTERFELL
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON and OSHA talk by a fire. An Ironborn keeps her bound.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: I'm no liar.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: There are other ways to serve, my lord.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AHSA: There are other ways to serve, my prince.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Like what?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: We know things, the free people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: Other things.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA begins to undress.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: Savage things.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Wait outside.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON takes a bite of his apple, The Ironborn leaves and OSHA lets her dress fall to the floor.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: I always wondered what you had under there.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: It comes at a price.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: I'm not killing you. That's your price.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: I already had that.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: What do you want then, other than your miserable life?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	AHSA: What all free people want. My freedom.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON: Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SHAE: Shh. It's not deep.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: I thought they were going to kill me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SHAE: They thought so, too.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SHAE:  Of course he did.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: Why? Why would a stranger-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SHAE: You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SHAE: Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SANSA: But you're not the wrong people.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	SHAE: Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	THEON sleeps. OSHA slinks away. She walks through the courtyard and encounters a guard.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: And where are you going?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: I have something for you from Prince Theon.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	GUARD: What?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA: Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	OSHA kisses him and he responds. She pulls a knife and slits her throat.

s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS and XARO walk in the garden. KOVARRO trails them.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	DAENERYS: The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO: When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO opens the door for DAENERYS. They move into the courtyard to find it strewn with bodies, throats cut. DAENERYS takes in the scene, and then runs in a panic.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	XARO: Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi.
s02e06	The Old Gods and the New	Bells toll as DAENERYS runs, followed by KOVARRO and XARO. She climbs a staircase to her chamber, where IRRI lies slain. The dragons are gone.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON dresses down BLACK LORREN while DAGMER watches.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BLACK LORREN: The giant must have took him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BLACK LORREN: Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON punches BLACK LORREN in the jaw, who falls to the ground. THEON shakes the pain out of his fist. He then kicks BLACK LORREN repeatedly.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	Leashed dogs chase the scent of the fugitives. Mounted riders follow.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN: Come on, find the scent. Where they going?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	The dogs seem to have picked up a scent and they pause.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAGMER: Halt!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	The riders stop.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: Enjoying your first hunt?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LUWIN: So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: With hunting, there's blood at the end.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LUWIN: They're little boys.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LUWIN: Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: They have no value to me missing.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LUWIN: Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN:  We have a scent!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	OSHA: Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRAN: And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	OSHA: The boy can't survive on walnuts.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKON cracks the walnut he holds.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKON: Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRAN: We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: Don't call them that.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: What, stones? Or bone?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: Neither. Both.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	Having checked her bindings, he picks up his sword and leads her off.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: Move!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: So the lads just do it with each other?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: No.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: Never?

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: Would you please shut up?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: You're a free woman?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: It was my choice to say the words.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: Of course I like girls.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: But you chose never to touch them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THE MOUNTAIN: We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THE MOUNTAIN: Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA sits and eats the mutton.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: (shakes her head)
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA realizes that TYWIN has let his guard down, and considers her options. But he turns back to her and she starts, suddenly.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN walks to the fireplace.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: Dragons?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Yes. Dragons happened.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN pours himself some wine.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: Aegon and his sisters.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Mmm?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Correct. A student of history, are you?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: (smiles)

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: Most girls are idiots.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: From my father.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA rises, clearing the dishes and walking away.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: And, girl.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA stops.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: "M'lord."

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYWIN: Lowborn girls say "m'lord," not "my lord. " If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ARYA: My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SANSA: I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THE HOUND: Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SANSA: Does it give you joy to scare people?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THE HOUND: No, it gives me joy to kill people.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SANSA: (gasps)
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THE HOUND: Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SANSA: It was his duty. He never liked it.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THE HOUND: Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SANSA: Why are you always so hateful?

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: You are one of the Thirteen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: But it did happen under your roof.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JON: No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE comes closer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	YGRITTE: You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: And what then?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: She, uh...
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROOSE: Too many prisoners.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: Torrhen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TORRHEN moves forward to take charge of his newly-assigned ward.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: That will be all.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TORRHEN grabs ALTON's shoulder and leads him out of the tent, followed by RICKARD KARSTARK and the other councilors. ROOSE BOLTON stays behind. He moves to speak to ROBB when LADY TALISA MAEGYR enters. She is wearing a blood-stained apron and wiping her hands with a rag in similar condition.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: I've been treating your wounded men.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: They're not my enemies.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: That's what I tell my bannermen.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: But some are not.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: I need silk for stitching.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB walks from behind the small table to stand in front of TALISA. He gazes at her face while she speaks.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: If you need help finding these-
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: Continue, my lady.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: Yes.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TALISA: The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.

I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SANSA: (nods)
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SANSA: His Grace was not with you?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: When?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.

I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: I understand completely.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: Which knight was it?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: What was he like?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: It's hard to put into words.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: (nods) Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: Did you squire for him again?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: (smiles)
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: And have you thought about
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Of course. Every day.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: And?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: (nods)
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: What is it?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME looks out at the guards.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: It's actually quite simple.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: Well, let me help you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: You'll only have to do one thing.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ALTON: Tell me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: (whispers)You'll have to die.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME headbutts ALTON and then beats him to death with his chained hands. TORRHEN comes to check on his bloodied body. JAIME chokes TORRHEN with his chained hands until his neck snaps. JAIME takes the keys to complete his escape.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	EXT: QARTH, GARDEN
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH enters a garden where QUAITH covers the back of a man with symbols painted in blood.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH: Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH: I didn't come here for lessons.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH: No, you came for the dragons.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH: You have them? Where are they?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH: Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH does not answer. She returns to painting.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH: You love her.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH: Where are the dragons?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH: Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH does not answer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH: Will you betray her again?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH: Never.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH: The thief you seek is with her now.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	QUAITH returns to painting and JORAH exits, quickly.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	INT: QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS appears before the Thirteen to plead for her dragon's return.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SPICE KING: I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SILK KING: Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: Without me, the dragons will die.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SPICE KING: It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYAT PREE: You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: How?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYATT PREE: I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: You have my dragons?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYAT PREE: When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS: But there is no King of Qarth.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO stands.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYAT PREE joins XARO's side.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	SPICE KING: Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	XARO: An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYAT PREE: The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYAT PREE's doppelgangers slit the throats of the other members of the Thirteen, simultaneously. DAENERYS is horrified, and flees. She encounters another PYAT PREE clone. KOVARRO comes to her side to defend her, but JORAH stabs PYAT PREE from behind first.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYATTPREE: A mother should be with her children.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JORAH removes his sword and PYATTPREE collapses into a pile of empty clothes, an illusion. Another clone appears.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	PYAT PREE:  Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAENERYS, JORAH, and KOVARRO exit.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	INT: RIVERLANDS
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LADY CATELYN STARK sits in her tent, writing. JACKS tries to enter.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JACKS: Lady Stark!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH blocks JACKS at the door.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE: No farther.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JACKS: Keep your hands off me, woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE: Don't enter without an invitation, man.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JACKS: Forgive me. Lady Stark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: What is it?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JACKS: They caught the Kingslayer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CUT TO: THE CAMP
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME is being led in chains by a mounted soldier, back into camp. The other soldiers assault him verbally. They jostle at one another in an attempt to make the assault physical, but his captors keep the other men away.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN: Kingslayer!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #2: Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #3: Hang him!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #4: Hang him!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #5: You'll die today.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #6: Justice for the Karstark.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	They proceed further into the camp, but the angry soldiers eventually overpower JAIME's protectors. One man clubs him over the head and JAIME falls. The crowd gathers around to further abuse him. JAIME lies in pain. The horseman rides away, leaving JAIME in the hands of his captors, with a thick crowd behind him. They bring JAIME to his feet. He walks a few paces and then falls to his knees under the pressure of the crowd.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN: Gut him!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK swiftly approaches the crowd and draws his sword.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN, BRIENNE, and JACKS enter.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD: This monster killed my son.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: I will have his head. And if you try and stop me
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: And where is our king now?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	ROBB: You know very well.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: How dare you!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE starts to draw her sword.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE: Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: Wise men do not make demands of kings.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK: Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	RICKARD KARSTARK exits.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: And gag him!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	INT: KING'S LANDING
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI and TYRION are in her bedroom. CERSEI is lighting candles with a long straw.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: Since when do you light your own candles?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	She blows out the flame on the straw's end.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: How many times can you read one raven scroll?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: More than we have.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: "Rain fire on them from above." You're quoting Father, aren't you?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: I thought the girls might help him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: Did you?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: I was wrong. If we can't control him
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CESEI: Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: Sins?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI: The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? "Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	TYRION: You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CERSEI begins to cry. TYRION approaches, perhaps to comfort her, but there is no closeness between them.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	EXT: ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	The soldiers mill about. Two of them are engaged in an argument.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN: Then why wait?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #2: We're sworn to the king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN: There's not a king.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #2: That's treason.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN: So is saving Lannisters, yeah?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN #2: Back off, you.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	MAN: No, I won't.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE and CATELYN watch from a distance, concerned about the lack of order.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE: Your son returns at dawn, my lady?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: So they say.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE: The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: Come.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	BRIENNE follows CATELYN. A guard leads them into JAIME's cage. He is covered in blood.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: I need to be alone with him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	GUARD:  My lady, our orders-
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	The guard exists. BRIENNE moves outside the cage.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: You strangled his son with your chains.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: You are a man without honor.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: Brienne.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	JAIME: No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	CATELYN: (to BRIENNE) Your sword.

s02e07	A Man Without Honor	DAGMER and an Ironborn raider lead LUWIN through the crowd.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LUWIN: What are you doing? What have you done?
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON: If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON gestures behind him. The raiders raise two bodies of children, hanged by their necks and burned beyond recognition. The crowd is horrified.
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	LUWIN: No!
s02e07	A Man Without Honor	THEON looks upon the bodies, and then looks down, feeling a pang of guilt.

s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: WINTERFELL
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	A soldier empties a basket of dead ravens out a tower window. They collect at the feet of PRINCE THEON GREYJOY and DAGMER.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAN: Riders approaching!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAR #2: Open the gate!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The gates open slowly and a band of riders canter into the courtyard. Among them is LADY YARA GREYJOY, who exchanges glances with THEON before she circles him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	INT: DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA and her men have made themselves at home, feasting and sitting leisurely at the table. THEON enters.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The men laugh.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: Envy isn't attractive.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA:  What envy?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: Exactly.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: They made me a promise
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: Don't call me
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: You are weak. And you're stupid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: I'm warning you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: Go on, then. Warn me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON pauses.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: (to her men) Leave us.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	Her Ironborn men get up from the table and exit. YARA gets up and faces THEON.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: I don't intend to die.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA: You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YARA exits.

s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD OF BONES: I already got one crow. Don't need two.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD OF BONES: The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: He could have killed me half a dozen times.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD OF BONES: And now he wishes he did. Gut him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	A wildling draws a knife at the command.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD OF BONES turns around.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: Mance will want him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD OF BONES: What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The LORD OF BONES walks to face YGRITTE.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD OF BONES: He runs, I'll chop his balls off.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: He runs, I'll do it meself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The LORD OF BONES walks away.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE: We're even now, Jon Snow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	YGRITTE exits. The wildlings force JON down on his knees, next to QHORIN HALFHAND, who also been captured.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JON: I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QHORIN: I know.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JON: The others?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QHORIN: When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JON: They died because of me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QHORIN: See that it wasn't for nothing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	Two wildlings approach, and lift QHORIN to his feet.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	WILDLING: All right, up, lad.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	WILDLING #2: Come on, on your feet, now. Move it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	KING ROBB STARK and LADY TALISA MAEGYR walk through the trees as the sun sets, followed by soldiers and horses.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: Is she beautiful?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB:  I've never met her.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: What's her name?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: I'm sure you'll be very happy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	They laugh together.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: And you're marrying her for a bridge?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: An important bridge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: Ah.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, "How can a man be brave if he's afraid?" "That is the only time a man can be brave," he told me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: I wish I could have met him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: He would have liked you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: (chuckles) Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: He didn't care much about gold or glory.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA:  And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: Then why don't you?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: That would be a start.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	Riders approach.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	RIDER: Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: How? How?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	INT: CATELYN'S TENT
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB enters, finding LADY CATELYN STARK at her desk.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Tell me this isn't true.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN doesn't answer. She looks up at him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Why?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN: For the girls.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: You betrayed me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN: Robb-
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN: Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	RICKARD KARSTARK: I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN: I grieve for your sons, my lord.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	RICKARD KARSTARK: I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN : Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN: Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SOLDIER: Forty, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Send another forty with our fastest horses.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CATELYN: Robb.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB exits.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: RIVERLANDS WOODS.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	A white horse gallops over a small hill, riderless. Nearby, LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH pushes SER JAIME LANNISTER off his mount, hooded and chained. She sends the horse off. She helps him up.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: Damn.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	She takes off his hood and helps him stand.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE leads the chained JAIME forward.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE: Brienne of Tarth.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BIRENNE forces him down to his knees on the riverbank. A canoe sits nearby.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE looks off down the river, concerned of being seen.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE: Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE: You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE pulls JAIME up and leads him to the river's edge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE: You will not provoke me to anger.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE:  I've never seen you fight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE: All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRINENNE: Do you take me for an idiot? In!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME enters the canoe and lies down. BRIENNE boards as well and sits in the stern.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAIME: I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRINENNE: Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRIENNE launches the canoe and paddles it downstream.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	INT: HARRENHAL
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD TYWIN LANNISTER sits in council with SER KEVAN LANNISTER and other Lannister bannermen. LADY ARYA STARK attends to them, and listens intently
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	KEVAN: King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYWIN: Surrender the Iron Throne?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	KEVAN: Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYWIN: No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	KEVAN: The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYWIN: Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA serves wine to the table.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TWYIN: Too close to Casterly Rock.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	KEVAN: He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYWIN: He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYWIN ponders for a while by the hearth. He makes his decision.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYWIN: We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA looks worried.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: HARRENHAL COURTYARD
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA walks through the dismal courtyard. Soldiers torture their prisoners.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GUARD: You've got some questions to answer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAN: Who killed Ser Amory?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAN #2: I don't know! Please!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAN: Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAN #2: I told you, I don't know. Please.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA comes across RORGE and BITER sitting with some Lannister soldiers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	RORGE: Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Where's Jaqen?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	RORGE: Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GUARD: Come on, time to kill some wolves.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	They stand. Both RORGE and BITER eye ARYA as they walk past.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CUT TO: HARRENHAL FORGE
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE sits talking while GENDRY works some horse shoes, listless.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA enters.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Where's Jaqen?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: How would I know?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY: You need him?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: He's helping me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: I saw him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Where?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE shrugs and pops his pastry in his mouth. ARYA comes over and grabs his ears.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Where?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: Ow!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Where?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA tightens her grip.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: On patrol. Let go of my ears.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	She does. ARYA turns at sound of horses, and watches TYWIN mount. She walks towards him
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: What do you want with him anyway?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA watches TYWIN and his men ride off.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: THE NORTH
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QUORIN: Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JON: They'll never trust me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QUORIN: They might. If you do what needs to be done.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JON: What?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QUORIN: (yelling) How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JON: I didn't.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QUORIN: I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	QHORIN pushes Jon roughly, sending him tumbling down the side of the hill. The LORD OF BONES confronts QUORIN.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD OF BONES: He's not yours to kill, crow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The LORD OF BONES pushes QHORIN forward. YGRITTE pauses and looks sympathetically down the slope at JON, reconsidering him. JON sits up and looks back at her.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	INT: KING'S LANDING
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN and LORD TYRION LANNISTER sit in his chambers. TYRION is attempting to read, but he is annoyed by BRONN's fingernail scraping with a compass.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION; Do you have to do that here?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: I like to keep me hands clean.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Yes, but do you have to do it here?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN looks at TYRION, then throws the compass down on the desk in front of him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: You should start wearing the gold cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Fine, fine. No gold cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION goes back to his work. BRONN sucks his teeth and drums his finger, continuing to look at TYRION.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: What?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN:  What?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: What? What? Why are you staring at me?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: (scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN laughs as he stands up, and begins to pace around.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Stannis will be here any day.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN picks up a book from the pile as he walks past.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: And one of these explains how to beat him?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION gestures to the volume that he is reading.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: "An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. " By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS enters.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	He sits.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: For questioning?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: We talked about this.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN sits back down at the table.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: (nods)
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: Ah. "The Great Sieges of Westeros." Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION grabs a parchment and unrolls it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: We could throw books at his men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: We don't have that many books.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	BRONN: We don't have that many men, either.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: What do we have?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Pig shit.

s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The Night's Watch camps on the top of a cliff. The wind howls. GRENN, "DOLOROUS" EDDISION TOLLETT, and SAMWELL TARLY dig in the snow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: (panting) I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM sits down to rest. The others continue to dig.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DOLOROUS EDD: I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN: We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DOLOROUS EDD: You lack imagination.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: Where do you think Jon is right now?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DOLOROUS EDD: He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN: Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EDDISION: So did his father.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DOLOROUS EDD: Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN's shovel clangs against something metal.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN: What in seven hells is that?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	He plants his shovel and starts digging and clearing with his hands. SAM comes over to see. GRENN reveals a round stone cover, engraved with markings.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN lifts the cover and finds a bundle wrapped in a cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN: Look.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DOLOROUS EDD: If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: That's a Night's Watch cloak.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN: It's been here a long time.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN opens the bundle to reveal a set of obsidian knifes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: Oh. Must be dragonglass.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN: Dragonglass?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SAM: The maesters call it obsidian.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GRENN: Why would a brother hide it here?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DOLOROUS EDD: I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: HARRENHAL COURTYARD
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA caries a yoke with two buckets of water. She bumps into a Lannister soldier, and the contraption falls, spilling her load.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SOLDIER: Mind where you're going.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The SOLDIER smacks her across the head. ARYA looks dejected and crouches to pick up the empty bucket. A SOLDIER stops next to her.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: I'm sorry. I'll-
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA stands, and realized that it is JAQEN H'GHAR.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: (annoyed) Where were you?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: A man has patrol duty.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN puts down his helmet and sits.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: This a man cannot do.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	He pours some water from a pitcher and drinks.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: You promised you'd help me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: And you'll kill them? Anybody?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN considers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: A girl gives a man his own name?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: That's right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: Un-name me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: No.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: Please?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: I'll un-name you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: Thank you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: If you help me and my friends escape.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: A girl will obey.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN: A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JAQEN exits.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	INT: KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	PODRICK PAYNE pours wine for TYRION, who is seated at a table. QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER stands in the background.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Thank you, Podrick.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Odd little boy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: You and Varys both.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION removes his napkin from his neck and wipes his face.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: He's only a boy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Younger boys are off fighting his war.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: He's not ready.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	PODRICK snickers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Do you think I'm an idiot?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Because he doesn't have a cock.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Neither do you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: It's not that little.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: (laughs)
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Why are you smiling?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Because I'm happy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: And why are you happy?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	She sits.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Because I have your little whore.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I thought you preferred blondes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Why do you care who I fuck?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Where did you find her?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: You don't buy them, you only rent them.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SER MANDON MOORE moves behind her and opens the chamber door. TYRION looks worried. Two guards bring in ROS, rather than SHAE.  TYRION looks her over.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION takes her hand.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I promise I will free you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROS: Don't forget me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Never.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	The guards take her away. CERSEI looks pleased.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CERSEI: Get out.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	INT: KING'S LANDING
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION walks through the hallway and bursts into his chambers.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Shae!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SHAE: I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TRION: You're beautiful.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SHAE smiles and kisses him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SHAE: Then why do you look sad?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION kneels before her.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: We have to be more careful.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SHAE: Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: There are people who want to hurt me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SHAE: I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SHAE: I'm yours.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Promise me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SHAE: I'm yours and you are mine.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	They kiss.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	INT: THE RIVERLANDS
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB and LORD ROOSE BOLTON sit in conference.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Still no word?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROOSE BOLTON: We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROOSE BOLTON: He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROOSE BOLTON: A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROOSE BOLTON: I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA enters. They stand
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROOSE BOLTON: My lady.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROOSE BOLTON exits.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: How are you?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: You have every right. You're a king.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: That's not the kind of king I want to be.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: What kind do you want to be?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: I'd like to hear you play the harp.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: No. No, you would not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	They laugh. ROBB pours some wine and hands it to her.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	They both stand.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ROBB: I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TALISA: I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	They kiss passionately, and undress one another in a fury. They make love on the floor.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY: Shut up.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	AYRA: Shut up. What did you bring?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY: What did he want us to do about those guards?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: He didn't say. He just said, "Walk through the gates."
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY: What about the guards?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: He didn't say anything about the guards.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY: What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: We have to trust him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY: Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	HOT PIE: I want to go back to the kitchens.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA: Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	ARYA gets up and walks towards the gate.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY: Arry, don't.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	GENDRY and HOT PIE follow. When they reach the guards, they realize that all have been slaughtered. They walk through the gate.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: STANNIS'S FLEET
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	Soldiers fire a large crossbow in the night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAN: Away! Reset!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	SER DAVOS SEAWORTH and KING STANNIS BARATHEON stand on deck.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: Will it hold?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	They walk down some steps to the main deck and continue on.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAN: Again, pull!
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: I admire you, Ser Davos.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: I thank you, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: Do you? Why?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: My father was a crabber.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: And?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: Some are happy to do it to my face.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: He was only a boy.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: (exhales)
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: I was relieved they did not.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAVOS: Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	STANNIS: I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: KING'S LANDING
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	KING JOFFREY BARATHEON, VARYS, and TYRION walk through the streets of King's Landing
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JOFFREY: You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JOFFREY: The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JOFFREY: If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JOFFREY: They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JOFFREY exits.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: Imagine Stannis' terror.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: I am trying.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: I wish we could, too.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: What do you want? Tell me.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: If we're going to play, you'll have to start.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: A most highborn plumber.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I do. Last thing I expected.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: And you play it well.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: We should sail there immediately.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	VARYS: She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	TYRION: One game at a time, my friend.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	EXT: QARTH
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS TARGARYEN peers through a boarded entryway. SER JORAH MORMONT approaches.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JORAH: Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS: Astapor?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JORAH: We cannot stay here.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS: They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JORAH: They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS: You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JORAH: You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS: Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JORAH: That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS: And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	JORAH: Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS touches JORAH's face.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAENERYS: They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.

s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAGMER: What's this?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	THEON: Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAGMER: His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	MAESTER LUWIN approaches and exchanges a glance with OSHA. She ducks into an entryway. LUWIN looks at THEON and DAGMER.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	DAGMER: His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LUWIN walks over to look at the burned bodies of BRAN and RICKON.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	CUT TO: DARKNESS
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	OSHA lights a candle.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	OSHA: Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LUWIN: You're right so far.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	OSHA: Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LUWIN: Must have been the farmer's boys.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	OSHA: He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LUWIN: They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	OSHA: They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
s02e08	The Prince of Winterfell	LORD BRAN STARK sits just out of sight, having heard everything. HODOR and RICKON STARK sleep.

s02e09	Blackwater	EXT. THE SEA AT NIGHT
s02e09	Blackwater	KING STANNIS BARATHEON's fleet sails through the night. SER DAVOS SEAWORTH walks the deck, and looks out the stern at the rest of the ships. The camera cuts to STANNIS looking ahead before cutting to show soldiers sitting below, tired and waiting. One vomits from seasickness.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS and his son, MATTHOS SEAWORTH, are above deck.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: That's it. The tide's against us.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: You're coming home.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Gods be good.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: But not over them?
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Well, first, we have to put it there.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
s02e09	Blackwater	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s02e09	Blackwater	LORD TYRION LANNISTER and SHAE lie in bed.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Are you afraid, my lion?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: I won't let them hurt you.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE sits astride him.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: It is now.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: You can't fuck your way out of everything.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
s02e09	Blackwater	They kiss.
s02e09	Blackwater	INT: CERSEI'S CHAMBERS
s02e09	Blackwater	QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER looks out her window. GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE is advising her.
s02e09	Blackwater	PYCELLE: As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Your words are always wise and measured.
s02e09	Blackwater	PYCELLE: If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: You brought me something?
s02e09	Blackwater	PYCELLE: Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: I know what ten drops will bring.
s02e09	Blackwater	PYCELLE: Your Grace, if I may ask-
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
s02e09	Blackwater	PYCELLE: Yes. A siege is very-
s02e09	Blackwater	ERSEI: Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.
s02e09	Blackwater	PYCELLE: Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	INT: KING'S LANDING
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN and the soldiers of King's Landing are drinking and singing, with some prostitutes mingling among them. BRONN has his arm around a prostitute.
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: (singing) And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: To the boys!
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN:
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Drunk Lannisters.
s02e09	Blackwater	The soldiers laugh.
s02e09	Blackwater	PROSTITUTE: You've got a pretty voice.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Thank you very much.
s02e09	Blackwater	PROSTITUTE: And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN pulls her to stand in front of him.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
s02e09	Blackwater	PROSTITUTE:  Oh.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN start to undress her.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-
s02e09	Blackwater	The prostitute is fully naked, and BRONN's thoughts are going elsewhere.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.
s02e09	Blackwater	She sits on his lap and kisses his nose.
s02e09	Blackwater	PROSTITUTE: Poor nose.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
s02e09	Blackwater	The men laugh.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE and a soldier enter.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Welcome, friends. This round's on me.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND and his companion stand in front of a table. The two men sitting there vacate if for them, silently. They sit down. THE HOUND drinks from the mug sitting there.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: (whispering) I don't think he likes me.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: You think you're a hard man?
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: I know it.
s02e09	Blackwater	The men laugh.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me.
s02e09	Blackwater	He stands and walks towards BRONN.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Only smaller.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: And quicker. Eh?
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN pats the prostitute on the knee, and she gets off his lap. He stands to face THE HOUND.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Aye I expect he will someday.
s02e09	Blackwater	He reaches behind him to a dagger sheathed at his waist. A bell tolls. The soldiers get up and leave.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Here we are.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: One more drink before the war? Shall we?
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND backs off. They both exit.
s02e09	Blackwater	INT: TYRION'S CHAMBERs
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS stands by the window while PODRICK PAYNE helps to dress TYRION in his armor.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: A wedding.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: Exactly. Podrick, is that it?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: "Is that it?" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: Do you trust him?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Oddly enough, I do.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: Good.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS unfolds a map before them.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: The map you asked for.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION steps down to study the map. PODRICK continues to dress him.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Well, I'm not.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: What of it?
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: No, I don't believe you have.
s02e09	Blackwater	VARYS: One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.
s02e09	Blackwater	PODRICK hands TYRION his war axe.
s02e09	Blackwater	EXT:  THE BARATHEON FLEET
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: They're welcoming the new king.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: Drums!
s02e09	Blackwater	Soldiers start to play the drums. The soldiers spring to action, readying for battle. STANNIS watches, resolute.
s02e09	Blackwater	INT: KING'S LANDING
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Remember, wait till the ships-
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: The ships are in the bay.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: They must be far enough in-
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: I know what "in" means. Do you know how to use that?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
s02e09	Blackwater	They clasp hands.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Don't get killed.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Nor you, my friend.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Oh, are we friends now?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Enhances it, really.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN: Been spending time with fancy folks.
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN exits. LADY SANSA STARK and SHAE enter.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Lady Sansa and Sheila.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Shae.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.
s02e09	Blackwater	KING JOFFREY BARATHEON and THE HOUND enter.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Sansa.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Always been a great romantic, my nephew.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Sansa, come here.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: I will pray for your safe return, my lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Will you?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Just as I pray for the king's.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA walks away.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Stay safe, my lady.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: And you, my lion.
s02e09	Blackwater	PODRICK and TYRION exit
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
s02e09	Blackwater	He draws his sword and presents it.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA leans down and kissed the blade.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Will you slay him yourself?
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY and THE HOUND exit
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Some of those boys will never come back.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE:  Shh. Come, my lady.
s02e09	Blackwater	EXT: THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL
s02e09	Blackwater	The soldiers buzz with activity. JOFFREY enters, along with TYRION, THE HOUND and SER LANCEL LANNISTER. A horse gallops through, and some townsfolks scurry past. They climb the stairs to the top of the exterior wall all look out into the empty harbor.
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: Where's our fleet?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: On the way.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION does not answer.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: The king has asked you a question.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Where are their ships?
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Maybe.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI and PRINCE TOMMEN BARATHEON join the highborn ladies. They walk past SHAE and SANSA.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: I doubt it.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Maybe she's jealous of you.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Why would she be jealous?
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Sansa.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA gets up and walks over to her.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Yes.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	A servant pours the wine. CERSEI hands it to SANSA.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: So? I didn't offer you water.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: What's he doing here?
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: But we have guards to defend us.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.
s02e09	Blackwater	A door opens and a gold cloak walks in. He bows to CERSEI.
s02e09	Blackwater	GOLD CLOAK: The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
s02e09	Blackwater	He bows and moves to ILYN PAYNE, then exits the chamber.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: You said he was here to protect us.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION, JOFFREY, THE HOUND, and LANCEL look out across the foggy sea.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: There they are.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Archers to their marks.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: Archers, to your marks!
s02e09	Blackwater	The archers set their bows.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: Archers! Nock your arrows!
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER #2: Nock arrows!
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Hold fast.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: Hold fast!
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: What are you doing? We need to attack them.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Hold fast.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: Boulders ready!
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER #2: Hold fast!
s02e09	Blackwater	There is but one ship sailing out of the harbor.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS and DAVOS watch the lone ship approaching.
s02e09	Blackwater	MATTHOS: There's only one ship.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock.
s02e09	Blackwater	The soldiers get set.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Nock and set!
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Draw! Hold.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Hold.
s02e09	Blackwater	They watch the ship sail by. It is unmanned.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: (confused) There's no one on board.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: More rocks coming up!
s02e09	Blackwater	HAYLLNE climbs the stairs. TYRION looks back at him. HAYLLNE lights a torch and hands it to TYRION.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Hold.
s02e09	Blackwater	As the empty ship sails past, DAVOS sees that it is spewing green liquid into the sea behind it
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION throws the torch over the side of the wall. BRONN gets the signal, lights his arrow ablaze and launches it high into the sky.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET
s02e09	Blackwater	The flaming arrow soars over DAVOS's boat and hits the wildfire in the water, which erupts in green flame. The flames crawl towards the ghost ship.
s02e09	Blackwater	DAVOS: Matthos! Get down!
s02e09	Blackwater	A huge explosion. The ghost ship explodes ferociously, overwhelming MATTHOS and many other soldiers. STANNIS recoils from the blast
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY shields his eyes from the blast. HAYLLNE seems pleased. THE HOUND is resolute.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN watches the explosions.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET
s02e09	Blackwater	The explosion engulfs the fleet. Meet scream in agony, devoured in green flame, some jumping overboard. The immensity of the explosion is stunning. Chaos ensues on board as the ships collapse.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION, PODRICK, THE HOUND, and JOFFREY watch. HAYLLNE smiles. TYRION is horrified.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE BARATHEON FLEET
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS's ship is unharmed. He gets to his feet and surveys the massive destruction. Men scream and masts collapse.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: Prepare to land.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: The dwarf has played his little trick.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: The wildfire.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: He can only play it once.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: Thousands.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS descends from the upper deck and addresses his troops.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: Come with me and take this city!
s02e09	Blackwater	The men yell in agreement.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI is a bit drunk, and still drinking wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Sansa, come here, little dove.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: My queen.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: What are you doing?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Praying.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: For the gods to have mercy on us all.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Oh. On all of us?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Yes, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Even me?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Of course, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Even Joffrey?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Joffrey is my-
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI holds out a glass for her servant to fill.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: One for her.
s02e09	Blackwater	The servant pours the wine. She hands it to SANSA.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Here. Sit. Drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA sits and takes a sip of wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Not like that. Drink, girl.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA takes a bigger gulp.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: And if the city should fall?
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA is speechless.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	They both drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI takes a drink and SANSA joins her, panicking.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR
s02e09	Blackwater	Landing boats from the ships row towards the shore.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: They're coming. They're coming ashore.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Rain fire on them.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Archers!
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: There are too many.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.
s02e09	Blackwater	PODRICK: Yes, my lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BELOW THE HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND punches LANCEL in chest as he walks past. LANCEL is stunned.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Pull, pull! Go!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	The archers prepare to fire.
s02e09	Blackwater	SOLDIER: Nock! Draw!
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Draw!  Draw!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS's men have reached the shore.
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Kill the Lannisters!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Loose! Loose!
s02e09	Blackwater	The archers let their flaming arrows fly.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR
s02e09	Blackwater	The arrows land as the soldiers rush from the boats to the shore.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Form the line!
s02e09	Blackwater	The arrow land. Some hit there mark. Some Baratheon men fall while others pour ashore.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!
s02e09	Blackwater	The archers release more salvos. STANNIS's forces take heavy casualties, but they do not give up. Yelling, the first of them make it to base of the harbor wall. Above them, Lannister forces drop rocks, which crush the skulls of the unlucky. STANNIS himself gets sprayed with the blood of his bludgeoned soldier. They place their shields above their heads.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: To the Mud Gate, go now!
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: INSIDE THE HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND leads a charge of Lannister men.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse.
s02e09	Blackwater	He and LANCEL engage with the sieging forces. They each cut down a number of Baratheon men before LANCEL is struck in the chest by an arrow. He stumbles and screams. Panting, he retreats.
s02e09	Blackwater	INT: MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEl: When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: You were Robert's queen.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI walks over to SHAE.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Pretty.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE rises and curties.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI demonstrates and SHAE mimics her.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: A few weeks, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI sits, still a bit drunk.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: When did you leave Lorath?
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE is confused.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: (smiles)
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Ten years ago, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Shae, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Tell us a story, Shae.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: When I was thireen, I-
s02e09	Blackwater	A door opens. LANCEL stumbles in past the guards.
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: Your Grace!
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: What news?
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Where is Joffrey?
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Bring him back inside at once.
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: Your Grace-
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: What?
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: The king's presence is good for morale.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Bring him back to his chambers now.
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: Not here?
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: No, but I-
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Now!
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL exits. CERSEI sits, requesting more wine. She turns to SANSA.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA looks at ILYN PAYNE.
s02e09	Blackwater	EXT: THE HARBOR SHORE
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND decimates his foes as the chaos of battle continues. Both sides take brutal casualties. A flaming man runs screaming towards THE HOUND, who is frozen by the horror of the sight. An arrow takes down his assailant. THE HOUND looks up to see that he has BRONN to thank.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Help me!
s02e09	Blackwater	BRONN quickly dispatches some more Baratheon men with his knife. THE HOUND is in a bit of a daze, overwhelmed by the fires, reliving his own trauma. He turns and re-enters the gates. Many of the Lannister forces follow.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Fall back! Fall back!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: STANNIS ON THE HARBOR SHORE
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS continues to be trapped under his shield at the base of the wall.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: Get the ladders up!
s02e09	Blackwater	His forces bring ladders to the wall. They set them, and STANNIS begins to climb, dodging rocks. He makes it to the top and engages with the Lannister forces atop the wall.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND is still in a daze.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Someone bring me a drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	A soldier hands him a skin. He drinks and spits it out.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
s02e09	Blackwater	Another soldier gives him wine, and he drinks deeply. He shuffles though the courtyard, passing TYRION.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Eat shit, dwarf.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: You're on the wrong side of the wall.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND looks down, defeated.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND exits.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR
s02e09	Blackwater	More boats come ashore. The soldiers overturn the boat to use it as protection from the arrows.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Loose!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #2: Put your backs into it!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #3: All right, get up!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Loose!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #2: Clear!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #3: Forward!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Loose!
s02e09	Blackwater	While the overturned boat makes slow progress, another group of men with a battering ram overtakes them and reaches the wall.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Forward ladders!
s02e09	Blackwater	Another ladder is raised against the wall. The boat is placed over the ram. Meanwhile, men are crushed by thrown rocks.
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Heave! Heave!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BEHIND THE WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL runs to join the royal group.
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: If you won't defend your own city, why should they?
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: What would you have me do?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: She did not say, Your Grace.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY hesistates.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: All men to the battlements!
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY: Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle.
s02e09	Blackwater	MANDON: (nods)
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself.
s02e09	Blackwater	JOFFREY and LANCEL exit. A bundle of stones is mismanaged at the top of the wall, and it comes crashing down.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Stand fast!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #2: No! Get up, you fool.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #3: We need more arrows!
s02e09	Blackwater	The Lannister men gather in the courtyard, looking for direction.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Where is the king?  Why isn't he with us?
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #2: Who are we fighting for?
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #3: Who leads us?
s02e09	Blackwater	PODRICK ascends the stairs to TYRION.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Yes.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN #2:  What are you talking about?
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	The battering ram pounds relentlessly into the wooden door.
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Heave! Heave!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BEHIND THE WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	The battering ram is making progress.
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Heave! Heave! Heave!
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BEHIND THE WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
s02e09	Blackwater	The Lannister forces raise their swords and shout in support. TYRION strides off, and they follow.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI and TOMMEN sit. LANCEL reports.
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Where is my son?
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: I want to escort him back to the battle.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
s02e09	Blackwater	LANCEL: Now listen to me-
s02e09	Blackwater	Enraged, CERSEI leaps up and stabs LANCEL, who falls to ground, writhing and screaming in pain. She walks over him, and exits with LANCEL. The women begin to panic.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA:  Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy...
s02e09	Blackwater	ALL: Save our sons from war, we pray.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE grabs SANSA from behind, startling her.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE indicates ILYN PAYNE, who stands guard.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Come with me.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: I need to say goodbye to someone.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: The queen said they'd rape everyone.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: No one is raping me.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE reveals a dagger bound her her calf, beneath he dress.
s02e09	Blackwater	SHAE: Go. Run.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA turns and exits qucikly.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: SANSA'S CHAMBERS
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA moves fleetly through the corridor. She enters her chambers and bolts the door. She picks up a doll.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: The lady is starting to panic.
s02e09	Blackwater	She turns around in fright to find THE HOUND sitting quietly in the corner.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: What are you doing here?
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Not here for long. I'm going.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: Where?
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: What about the king?
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: He can die just fine on his own.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND takes a drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND stands.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND stumbles forward. SANSA whispers.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
s02e09	Blackwater	SANSA: You won't hurt me.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND: No, little bird, I won't hurt you.
s02e09	Blackwater	THE HOUND turns and unlocks the door. SANSA considers whether to join him.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE SEWERS
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION uses his axe to remove the chain from the sewer's gate. He steps out onto the shore and the Lannister men follow quietly.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	The battle rages. The ram has made further progress. Flaming arrows still rain down.
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN: Heave!
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION comes up behind the man and slices his ankle wide open. He falls and TYRION lands another heavy blow, blood spurting. He then rallies his men forward, coming behind the Baratheon forces.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Attack!
s02e09	Blackwater	Their surprise attack is successful, and they quickly dispatch the vulnerable men.
s02e09	Blackwater	MEN:  Roll it over!
s02e09	Blackwater	They overturn the boat, and someone above drops a torch inside to set it aflame. They all celebrate with a resounding cheer.
s02e09	Blackwater	ALL: Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION turns around to see a host of soldiers coming upon them from the short. The battle begins again.
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION: Oh, fuck me.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: ATOP THE WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS continues to wage brutal war agains the Lannister men atop the wall
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL
s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION battles a soldier with a mace. The soldier gains the advantage, but is then tackled by one of TYRION's men. He smiles, while a Baratheon knight notices him and walks forward. He swings his sword at TYRION, and slices open his cheek. TYRION reels. Suddenly, a spear pierces the knight's face. He falls to reveal PODRICK wielding the fatal weapon. TYRION goes into shock, and PODRICK catches him
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI and TOMMEN sit in the dark on the Iron Throne.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Shh! Be calm, my sweet.
s02e09	Blackwater	TOMMEN: They're still fighting.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
s02e09	Blackwater	TOMMEN: The Kingswood?
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.
s02e09	Blackwater	TOMMEN: Like what?
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Like stags.
s02e09	Blackwater	TOMMEN: Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: And wolves.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR SHORE
s02e09	Blackwater	PODRICK holds TYRION, who remains in shock.
s02e09	Blackwater	PODRICK: My lord.
s02e09	Blackwater	Another wave of soldiers approaches from the shore. Some are mounted.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEl: He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, "You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS looks down from his perch. The mounted soldiers attack.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: "For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR SHORE
s02e09	Blackwater	The battle rages. The mounted soldiers have the advantage.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: And the cub said, "Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

s02e09	Blackwater	TYRION passes out.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE THRONE ROOM
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI presents the vial for TOMMEN to drink.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: "I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."
s02e09	Blackwater	The chamber door burst open and CERSEI and TOMMEN stand. Soldiers march in. LORAS TYRELL takes off his helmet.
s02e09	Blackwater	CUT TO: THE HARBOR SHORE
s02e09	Blackwater	The Baratheon forces are in retreat.
s02e09	Blackwater	MAN: Back to the boats!
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!
s02e09	Blackwater	Men grab STANNIS and restrain him.
s02e09	Blackwater	STANNIS: No!

s02e09	Blackwater	TYWIN enters.
s02e09	Blackwater	CERSEI: Father.
s02e09	Blackwater	She drops the vial, spilling its deadly contents. The vial shatters.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	INT: KING'S LANDING
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LORD TYRION LANNISTER wakes to echos of the sounds of battle. GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE's face comes into focus. TYRION's head is crudely bandaged, with only one eye revealed. He is disoriented.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Pod.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PODRICK PAYNE bursts into the room
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PODRICK: Yes, my lord.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PYCELLE: Would you like something for the pain?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: What happened?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PYCELLE: The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Where am I?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PYCELLE: These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PYCELLE turns and begins to leave. A thought occurs to him. He takes out a coin and flicks it to TYRION.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PYCELLE: Oh, For your trouble.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PYCELLE exits.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CUT TO: THRONE ROOM
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	A white horse expels manure at the doorway leading to the throne room. LORD TYWIN LANNISTER rides the horse in, through the gathered crowd. From his throne, KING JOFFREY BARATHEON addresses the room.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	Bowing, a page presents a pillow to JOFFREY, who places the Hand's brooch up to TYWIN. TYWIN bows.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYWIN: Thank you, Your Grace.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	He turns his mount and exits.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH steps forward and kneels before JOFFREY.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LITTLEFINGER: You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The crowd laughs
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: Ser Loras Tyrell.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SER LORAS TYRELL steps forward from the crowd and kneels.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFFREY: Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LORAS: Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LADY MARGAERY TYRELL takes a few steps forward.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MARGAERY: With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CERSEI: Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The crowd murmurs.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CROWD: Margaery! We want Margaery!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY stands and gestures to quiet the crowd.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PYCELLE: Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER looks across to LADY SANSA STARK. CERSEI is pleased and SANSA is quite worried.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JOFFREY: The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The crowd applauds.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SANSA walks away, quite solemn. Once she is out of view, she smiles and laughs in relief. LITTLEFINGER catches up to her.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LITTLEFINGER: My lady. My sincerest condolences.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SANSA: They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LITTLEFINGER: You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SANSA: But, if he's not marrying me-
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LITTLEFINGER: He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SANSA: King's Landing is my home now.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LITTLEFINGER: Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CUT TO: BROTHEL
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS applies make-up to her eye. There is a knock on the door. ROS stands up to welcome her client.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	A hooded figure walks in, silently. He sits on the end of the bed.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The man removes his hood. It is VARYS.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: No need for that, my dear.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: You sure? Most men like what they see.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: I'm not like most men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: That's what most men say.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: (laughs)
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: Have we met?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: You wouldn't remember me if we had?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: I meet a lot of men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS reaches to fondle his cock, but finds that VARYS is a eunuch. She is taken aback, and steps backward.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: I know who you are.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: How do you know about that?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: I thought you said you knew who I was.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: What can I do for you, Lord Varys?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROS: I'm afraid of him.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	EXT: WESTERLANDS SHORE
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH pulls the boat up to the shore. SER JAIME LANNISTER waits, his hands chained.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: You're a virgin, I take it?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	Annoyed, BRIENNE pushes him forward. He walks and she follows.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: Walk.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: One or two tried.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: Not interested.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	They encounter three hanged women in the trees.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Ah. "They lay with lions." Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE pushes him roughly below the bodies, finally pinning him against a tree, and tying him fast against it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: What are you doing?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: Burying them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	Some men approach
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: I didn't leave it here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: I had me dagger.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME, nervously, gestures to BRIENNE.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Untie me. Now!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	Three men approach, in leather armor and bearing swords.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. (notices BRIENNE and JAIME) Whoa. What's your business here?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: Traveling a prisoner.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The three men laugh hysterically
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: You're a woman. A woman!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: Well, fuck me!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: If you've quite finished up-
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The men laugh even harder.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: All right, we'll be going.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	She turns to take care of JAIME.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: The Starks.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: What did he do?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: No, stealing is a crime.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: Where are you taking him?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: To Riverrun.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: Why Riverrun?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE works to unbind JAIME from the tree.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: Why not kill him?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: For stealing a pig?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: Sending him with you? How important could he be?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE does not answer.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: All right, have it your way, my lady.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2 moves closer.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: Do I know you?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Have you been to Ashemark?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: No.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Then you don't know me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Is it near Ashemark?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: No.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: I've never been there.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE frees him from the tree, and she and JAIME start to walk away.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: What do you think of these beauties?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: I hope you gave them quick deaths.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: Two of them we did, yeah.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN #2: I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	Again, they try to move along.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE pushes JAIME aside, draws her sword, and sets on the men, viciously. JAIME is surprised at her prowess in battle. She bests them all, and turns to MAN, who lies on the forest floor. She drops her long sword and draws her short sword.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: Two quick deaths.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	She stabs the MEN in the gut, painfully. She plunges deeper, and the MAN dies. She withdraws her sword and steps away.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAIME: Those were Stark men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE: I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BRIENNE turns and chops the rope that holds the three women's corpses with a large grunt. JAIME winces as the bodies thud to the ground.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	INT: RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	KING ROBB STARK sits in his tent. LADY CATELYN STARK sits as well.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CATELYN: Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROBB: I know that.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CATELYN: And you mean to do it anyway?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROBB: I love her.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CATELYN: I know that seems important to you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROBB: It is important to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CATELYN: Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROBB: And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CATELYN: Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROBB: Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CATELYN: And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROBB: My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ROBB exits.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	INT: BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	KING STANNIS BARATHEON sits by a hearth.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: You said you saw my victory in the flames.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: l I did. I still see it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS:  The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: You claimed to speak for a god.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: You talk about war as if you understand it.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: I've been fighting far longer than you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: Have you? Show me how you fight.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS leaps to his feet and starts choking MELISANDRE. She gasps painfully, grabbing his hands.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: Show me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE removes her hands from his and raises them in surrender.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: Inside you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS releases her suddenly and MELISANDRE falls to the follow, panting.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: I murdered my brother.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE walks over to STANNIS.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: We murdered him. Share the weight with me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: He wasn't your brother.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE caresses his head, soothingly.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: Let me show you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	She leads him over to the fire.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: Look into the fire, my king. Look.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: I see fire.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MELISANDRE: Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS stares into the fire. His eyes grow wide and his face softens. MELISANDRE rests her head on his shoulder.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	STANNIS: Yes.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	INT: WINTERFELL
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PRINCE THEON GREYJOY throws another log onto his fire, and sits before it, frustrated. A lone horn blows outside the gates of Winterfell.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: They want you to know you're surrounded.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The horn continues.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: No word from my father?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: No.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN crosses the room, and rests.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: Send more ravens.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: You killed all the ravens.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: The first time I saw Winterfell-
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The horn blows again. THEON rolls his eyes in anger.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, "Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. "We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The horn sounds again. THEON gets up in a fury. He shakes his fist at the window.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: And what's your counsel, trusted friend?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON sits again.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN leans over THEON's shoulder.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN faces THEON.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THOEN rises.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN comforts him with a gentle pat on the shoulder.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	EXT: WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON stands in the Winterfell courtyard, addressing his men.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The Ironborn men laugh.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MEN: Aye!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: You think they're right?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BLACK LORREN: Aye.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MEN: Aye!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: Mothers will name their sons for us.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MEN: Aye!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MEN: Aye!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MEN: Aye!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	THEON: What is dead may never die!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MEN: What is dead may never die!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAGMER hits THEON on the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. The Ironborn watch him fall.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	BLACK LORREN: Thought he'd never shut up.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAGMER: It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	A man placed a hood over THEON's head.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN enters.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	LUWIN: What is this? What are you doing?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAGMER stabs LUWIN in the gut with his spear. LUWIN crumbles to the ground, groaning in sharp pain.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAGMER: Let's go home.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	MAN: Come on.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAGMER and the Ironborn exit, dragging THEON with them. LUWIN collapses.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: Why would I lie about it?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: To create strife between my sister and me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Pod.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PODRICK: Yes, my lord?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PODRICK: No, my lord.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PODRICK: (nods)
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Then my hill tribesmen.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: We are. Podrick, would you mind?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	PODRICK opens the door and SHAE enters briskly. She comes to TYRION's side and sits.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS bows.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	VARYS: Come along now, Podrick.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: It was good of you to come.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: Good of me? Of course I come.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE reaches to adjust TYRION's bandages, but he prevents her.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: I want to see you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Believe me, you don't.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: Have you looked?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: (shakes his head)
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: I will be the first.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	She removes the bandages. They stick to the deep wound across TYRION's cheek. He grunts in pain. SHAE takes in the wreck of his cheek.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Well?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: You are a mess.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: You think I'm here for money?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: Leave?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE:  Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: What would we do in Pentos?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: Eat, drink, fuck, live.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: I want to go with you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	TYRION: I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SHAE: You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	They come to the base of the House of the Undying.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	KOVARRO: Where are the guards?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JORAH: No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS: Let them try.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	They ascend the first flight of stairs, and gaze up to the top of the tower. They cannot find an entrance.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS: Is this a riddle?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	They circle the base. DAENERYS disappears from JORAH's view. He encounters KOVARRO instead.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: After all the things you have seen, this is your question?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: If you would learn, you must come with me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: Where?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: My dancing master was from Braavos.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: Then we must part. A man has duties as well. Here.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: What is it?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: A coin of great value.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: Could it buy a horse?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: It is not meant for the buying of horses.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	ARYA: Then what good is it?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JAQEN: If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, "Valar Morghulis."

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	YGRITTE drops JON's sword for him. The wildlings release QHORIN, who charges at JON. He tries to grab his sword while scrambling away from the attack. He gets to his feet, and they battle convincingly. QUORIN forces JON to stumble into two wildlings, who push him back into the fight.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QHORIN: That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QHORIN attacks again. JON counters.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QHORIN: Your traitor father teach you that?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JON goes on the attack, but QHORIN parries.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QHORIN: Or was it your whore mother?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QHORIN headbutts JON, who falls. He gathers himself and charges, disarming QHORIN. He runs QHORIN through.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QHORIN: We are the watchers on the Wall.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	QHORIN falls, dead.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	YGRITTE: You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	RATTLESHIRT takes the sword from JON, and then slices through his bounds.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	RATTLESHIRT: Burn the body.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	WILDLING: Aye.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	RATTLESHIRT: You don't want this one coming back for you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	RATTLESHIRT exits and YGRITTE comes to JON's side.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	YGRITTE: Come along, Jon Snow.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	They walk together to the edge of the cliff.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	YGRITTE: Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JORAH, DAENERYS, KOVARRO, and the Dothraki have entered his bedroom. DOREAH sits up next to XARO
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOREAH: Khaleesi, please. He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS: Come.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS turns and walks. XARO makes a sudden move, but JORAH draws his sword and keeps him motionless.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	CUT TO: XARO'S SAFE
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	KOVARRO uses the amulet to open the vault's door. JORAH helps him to open the door. DAENERYS enters first. The vault is empty.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS: Nothing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	She turns around
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS: Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The Dothraki push XARO and DOREAH forward into the vault.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	XARO: I am king of Qarth. I can help you now, truly help you. We can take the Iron Throne. I'll bring you a thousand ships.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOREAH: Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	XARO: All that you have dreamed is within your reach!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The Dothraki close the vault door behind the pair.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOREAH: I beg you, please!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	XARO: Khaleesi.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOREAH: Please! Please!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	XARO: Khaleesi!

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The group is looking for things to loot.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JORAH: It's all a lie.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS hands him a golden vase.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS: Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JORAH: Aye, a small ship.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DAENERYS walks away.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	JORAH: (in Dothraki) Take all the gold and jewels.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	GRENN finds a piece of dung.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	GRENN: Is this goat?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOLOROUS EDD takes it, placing it in his basket.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOLOROUS EDD: It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	GRENN: Just bloody kill me.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SAM: No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOLOROUS EDD: The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SAM: And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	A horn blows in the distance.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SAM: It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The horn blows again
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	GRENN: Two blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	The horn blows a third time.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOLOROUS EDD: Come on.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	GRENN: Three blasts?
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	DOLOROUS EDD: Run!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	GRENN and DOLOROUS EDD flee. SAM is slower to follow.

s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SAM falls, landing next to the basked discarded by DOLOROUS EDD.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SAM: Grenn!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	GRENN and DOLOROUS EDD are running further away, not waiting or helping.
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SAM: Edd!
s02e10	Valar Morghulis	SAM stands. There is a high-pitches squeal. SAM sees figures coming towards him. He hides behind a large boulder. The figures comple closer, walking slowly. They are undead and decaying with blue eyes. An undead horse stops next to sam. A White Walker rides it, and he notices SAM. SAM begins to sob. The White Walker shrieks and orders his undead followers forward. There are scores of them, a seemingly endless onslaught. Another White Walker is mounted behind. He also gives the order forward.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SAM comes to a halt. Just ahead, a Night's Watchman kneels in the snow.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SAM: Brother?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SAM approaches the kneeling figure, and realizes that the man is decapitated and holding his own lifeless head in his lap. SAM looks ill and defeated. Behind him, a figure strides towards him, axe drawn. SAM turns and his eyes widen as he sees the undead Free Folk striding towards him. The ghoul raises his axe to strike, and SAM recoils and falls. As the last moment, a direwolf pounces on the undead man, saving Sam's life. As SAM lies stunned, GHOST pulls the his attacker away by the ankle. The ghoul shakes his way free and claws forward to SAM, grabbing at his legs. As SAM scrambles backwards, a torch lights the ghoul on fire. Engulfed in flames, the undead wildling finally collapses. SAM  looks up to see LORD COMMANDER JEOR MORMONT and the Night's Watch. He rises.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JEOR: Did you send the ravens?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SAM keeps his eyes on the ground in shame.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JEOR: Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SAM: (Shakes his head.)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JEOR: That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	YGRITTE: First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON:  (Nods)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The giant drives a large stake into the ground.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	YGRITTE: Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The giant finishes his work and looks at JON, growling. The party continues to walk through the camp, and the wildlings heckle JON has he passes.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	YGRITTE: In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON SNOW: When I'm free, will I be free to go?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BOY: Crow!
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BOY: Crow!
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	Boys throw rocks at JON.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	YGRITTE: Sure, you will.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BOY: Oh! (laughter)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	YGRITTE: And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON SNOW: What happened to their fathers?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	YGRITTE: Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't...

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	RATTLESHIRT: We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND: What do we want with a baby crow?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	YGRITTE: This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND rises and stares at JON.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND: That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND: Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: Jon Snow.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON kneels before TORMUND, mistaking him for MANCE RAYDER, the King-Beyond-the-Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The wildlings laugh
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND: Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart. ( Laughs. )
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE rises from the back of the tent.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON rises.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	RATTLESHIRT leaves. YGRITTE gives JON a look, and exits as well.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND: Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND:  Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE extends his hand,  and JON shakes it. MANCE holds on firmly.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: Why?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: He wants me to lead one day.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TORMUND glowers.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: (Hesitates) I want to be free.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE's guard rise and close in, menacingly.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: You saw what?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MANCE: You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JON: Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: They stay outside.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: I'm not afraid of you, little brother.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION pours himself some wine.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: How do you know that?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: You're going to make me cry.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Why do you care what I want from him?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: Because you've slandered me to Father before.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Slandered? When?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: I was nine, too.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: It's not slander if it's true.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Any lies in particular?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: I'm sure you filled your pockets.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BRONN: And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: I thought we were friends.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BRONN: We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BRONN: I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BRONN: Which means you can afford it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	EXT.  BLACKWATER BAY
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SER DAVOS SEAWORTH lies on a rocky shore, bruised, battered, and dehydrated. He looks out to the sea and sees a boat in the distance. He climbs atop the rocks and starts waving. He removes his shirt in desperation and waves that as well.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: Here. Here! Help me!
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS starts to lose hope. Then a horn blows from the distant boat. He is relieved.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CUT TO: BLACKWATER BAY, LATER
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	A ships' boat has made it to DAVOS. He greets them as they row to him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MAN: Who are you?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MAN: Aye, ser, and serving which king?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS hesitates.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: The one true king of Westeros...  Stannis Baratheon.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The man smiles slightly and throws a rope to DAVOS.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	INT. SALLADHOR'S SHIP
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS and SALLADHOR sit in the captain's quarters. DAVOS sits and SALLADHOR stands above him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: (Nods)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: He may have swam ashore as you did.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	Salladhor sits.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: Will you take me there?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: This war is not over.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: We're both sworn to King Stannis.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: What?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR stands and pours himself some wine, then sits again.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: I'm a pirate.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: You're a smuggler.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: Take me back there, please.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: You cannot turn Stannis against her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SALLADHOR: When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	Horses trot as ROBB STARK's army is on the move.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROOSE BOLTON: We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB: There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROOSE BOLTON: I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB: The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB's army advances
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	EXT. HARRENHALL
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB's forces have arrived at Harrenhall. ROBB surveys a courtyard that littered with bodies. Flies buzz noisily among the corpses. RICKARD KARSTARK and ROOSE BOLTON enter.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	RICKARD KARSTARK: Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROOSE BOLTON: The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	RICKARD KARSTARK: Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROOSE BOLTON: The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB and CATELYN walk somberly through the courtyard. CATELYN stops at a body propped against a section of wooden spikes, a blade through his heart. ROBB comes up behind her and looks at the sigil on the man's chest.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB: A Mallister?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CATELYN: Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB looks over at RICKARD KARSTARK and ROOSE BOLTON and the two men exit. He glances around at his soldiers atop the walls and throughout the courtyard and steps back from his mother.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB: (to his men) Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	A Stark soldier nods and leaves. CATELYN looks down as she is escorted away from ROBB by a group of soldiers.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TALISA approaches ROBB, watching as CATELYN is lead away.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TALISA: She's your mother.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB: She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	QYBURN coughs nearby and TALISA moves to tend to him.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	QYBURN: (barely audible) Water. Water.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TALISA: This needs to be cleaned and closed.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB holds a waterskin to QYBURN's mouth and he takes a few gulps.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROBB: What's your name, friend?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	QYBURN: Qyburn.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TALISA: You're lucky to be alive.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	QYBURN: Lucky?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	A bird caws as TALISA sets to treating QYBURN's injuries.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN LANNISTER works at his desk while TYRION looks on.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: (sighs) The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: Am I enjoying it?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: I was very happy as Hand of the King.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: (chuckles) Yes. I heard how happy you were.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN blows on his paper to dry the ink.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: You brought a whore into my bed.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: It wasn't your bed at the time.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN seals the letter he has finished.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: What do you want, Tyrion?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN stands and takes a goblet of wine.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN sits.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: You want Casterly Rock?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: It is mine by right.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: (sighs) We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION: Why?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION gets up, dejected, and starts to leave.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYWIN: Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	TYRION exits briskly in anger.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA STARK and SHAE sit on a dock, looking at ships.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: Why Dorne?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: Don't ruin the game.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: I told you, I don't want to play.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: (pointing to another ship) What about that one there?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: That one? It's going to Volantis.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: Why?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH and ROS walk onto the dock.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER approaches SANSA and SHAE.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER: Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: Lord Baelish.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER: Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE looks to SANSA, then stands and walks back to ROS.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER: I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER: You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: I won't tell anyone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER: How do I know?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SANSA: Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER: I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	Further back on the dock, ROS approaches SHAE.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROS: You're her handmaiden?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: Yes. And you're his...?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROS: I help manage his affairs.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: He's an important person.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROS: So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: Yes.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROS: Given where we started.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	SHAE: And where is that?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	ROS: It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LITTLEFINGER leaves SANSA and walks towards ROS and SHAE.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: They're growing fast.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DROGON screeches again and takes flight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: It's too beautiful a day to argue.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	A Dothraki man vomits on the deck below.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ...

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	STANNIS: I am fighting.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MELISANDRE: How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MELISANDRE: I'm not your enemy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAVOS: You are my enemy.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MELISANDRE: Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.

s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MARGAERY: Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	They all sit at the table, and servants begin to pour the wine.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MARGAERY: Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	LORAS: Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MARGAERY: The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JOFFREY: My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	There is an awkward pause as the main course is brought to the table.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MARGAERY: Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JOFFREY: Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CERSEI: I'm sure she does.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	EXT. OUTSIDE THE HARBOR OF ASTAPOR
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS stands on deck, watching their approach to the city.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CUT TO: THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ leads DAENERYS, JORAH, and MISSANDEI. MISSANDEI translates for KRAZNYS.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	They approach the gate.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: They will stand until they drop.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: Such is their obedience.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The foursome walks though a battalion of Unsullied warriors, standing at attention, who have made an aisle for them to pass through.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DANAERYS: They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valeryan) The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian) Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	Once they are through, the Unsullied reform at attention. The four ascend a platform at the end of the yard, the sea behind them, to survey the soldiers.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: Even the bravest men fear death.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valyrian) The knight says even brave men fear death.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian) Tell the old man he smells of piss.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valyrian) Truly, master?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian) No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing? (Continues in Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian) Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS steps forward and descents to the yard.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS calls an Unsullied forward. He pushes the man's shield and spear aside. He takes the Unsullied's knife and cuts away part of his leather chest armor
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: Tell the good master there is no need.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS grabs hold of the man's exposed nipple.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS slices off the man's nipple, throwing it to the ground. The solder does not flinch.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: My master points out that men don't need nipples.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS replaces the armor strap, and returns the soldier's arms to the ready.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian) Here, I'm done with you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	UNSULLIED: (speaking Valyrian) This one is pleased to have served you.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS turns around to face DAENERYS. The Unsullied soldier steps back into formation.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valyrian) She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian) What a soft mewling fool this one is. (continues in Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: How many do you have to sell?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valyrian)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS holds up eight fingers.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: Eight thousand.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: (speaking Valyrian) Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	KRAZNYS sheaths the knife. The Unsullied make way for KRAZNYS and MISSANDEI as the exit, then return to formation.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CUT TO: SLAVER'S BAY SHORE
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS and JORAH walk along the shore.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: Eight thousand dead babies.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: The Unsullied are a means to an end.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: Once I own them, these men...
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: They're not men. Not anymore.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	They come upon a busy yard where people work and some children play. One CHILD in particular looks at them as she tosses a wooded ball to herself. JORAH and DAENERYS continue into the yard.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The CHILD remains just ahead of them. Meanwhile, a dark hooded figure follows behind.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	The CHILD rolls her wooden ball to DAENERYS, who picks it up. The CHILD motions for her to open it. Behind her, the hooded figure draws a knife. He knocks the ball out of her hand before she can twist it open. JORAH grabs the man and wrestles him to the ground, revealing SER BARRISTAN SELMY. DAENERYS has been knocked to the ground, and the ball sits inches from her face. It opens, and a chittering, shiny scorpion crawls out and unfolds itself into display. It launches itself at DAENERYS, but is skewered by BARRISTAN's knife before it reaches her. He studies the pierced arachnid
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	CHILD: (hisses)
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BARRISTAN flicks the scorpion off his knife. The CHILD, whose mouth is now a corrupt shade of green, flees and jumps off the dock to the water. But when BARRISTAN reaches the edge, the CHILD is nowhere to be seen. He sheaths his knife, confused. DAENERYS and JORAH spot the CHILD on the overlook above them before she walks away.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: (to JORAH) The warlocks.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	She walks towards BARRISTAN.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: I owe you my life, Ser.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BARRISTAN: The honor is mine, my queen.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	He lowers his hood.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	DAENERYS: You know this man?
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	JORAH: (Nods) I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BARRISTAN approaches.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BARRISTAN: King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BARRISTAN kneels before her.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father. Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.
s03e01	Valar Dohaeris	BARRISTAN lowers his head in deference. DAENERYS considers his offer.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EXT: RIVERRUN
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB STARK and BRYNDEN TULLY, waist deep in the river, release the funeral boat of HOSTER TULLY. They return to the dock to rejoin the somber and silent CATELYN STARK and TALISA.  EDMURE TULLY steps forward, holding a bow while the others look on. He lights the arrow and fires an arcing shot at the distant boat. The arrow splashes wide of its mark. Perturbed and embarrassed, EDMURE looks back, then draws another arrow to ignite. He shoots, and this arrow also splashes errantly, while the boat drifts further downstream. The large crowd near the dock murmurs. ROBB laughs under his breath and BRYNDEN looks impatient. EDUMRE takes a breath and unleashes a nervous shot that also splashes uselessly. Fed up, BRYNDEN pushes EDMURE aside and takes his bow. CATELYN, ROBB, and TALISA try to maintain their composure. BRYNDEN lights an arrow, aims carefully, and unleashes an arcing shot. As the arrow flies, he turns and tosses the bow back to EDMURE, and walks off. Moments later, the arrow lands in the boat, setting it aflame. CATELYN is relieved. BRYNDEN continues to walk away. EDMURE watches as the flaming boat disappears at the river's bend.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	INT: RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him "nephew." He is your king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: Robb knows I meant him no disr-
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: I seized an opportunity.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: What value was the mill?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: Is he there now? Of course not.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: Martyn is fifteen, I believe.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: No.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: No.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: How many men did you lose?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE:  But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EDMURE: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB:  You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: We seem to be running short of patience here.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROBB: You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	INT: KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN LANNISTER stands by the head of the table. GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE, VARYS, and LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH enter silently. TYRION LANNISTER enters next. TYWIN sits, then PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER join him. TYRION remains still, while QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTERenters and surveys the room.  She pauses, then walks to the table. She picks up one of the two remaining empty chairs and places it directly next to TYWIN, then sits while the others smirk. TYRION comes forward, and drags the final chair noisily (and comically) to the opposite head of the table. He sits.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN: What news of Jaime?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	No one answers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN: Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	VARYS: We are trying, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN:  Try harder. What do we have, then?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	VARYS: Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN:  Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PYCELLE: A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: Titles do seem to breed titles.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN: You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN: Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CERSEI: (chuckles)
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Master of Coin?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYWIN:  It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CERSEI: I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PYCELLE: Hear, hear.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EXT: RIVERLANDS WOODS
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE's forces ride through the woods, singing.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MEN: (singing) He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	Behind the singing soldiers, LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH and SER JAIME LANNISTER are bound together, back to back, atop a single horse. JAIME suffers the indignity of facing backwards.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: You were armed when we were taken.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: You were not beating me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE:  Would I?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: They'll knock your teeth out.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: You think I care about my teeth?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: What does it matter?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME:  If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EXT: RIVERLANDS
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The camp of the Brotherhood without Banners is bustling. GENDRY helps THOROS to put on his armor. ARYA STARK sits nearby, watching.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GENDRY: If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THOROS: Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THOROS: You're not our prisoner, little lady.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: What am I?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THOROS: Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: So I can walk away, then?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THOROS: These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA gets up and walks away, frustrated. ANGUY and some men lead the bound HOUND through the camp.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THE HOUND: You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ANGUY: Better than anyone you've ever met.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THE HOUND: A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ANGUY: Why? So you can kiss him?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA:  You remember the last time you were here?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THE HOUND: Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ANGUY places a hood over the HOUND's head.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ANGUY: Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ANGUY helps THE HOUND into the wagon, and guides his hooded head to hit the top of the doorway.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ANGUY: (sarcastically) Watch your head. Off we go.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ANGUY pounds the side of the wagon.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DRIVER: Walk up!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA watches the wagon drive away while GENDRY packs up. HOT PIE enters, holding some bread.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA:  What are you doing? We're about to leave.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	HOT PIE: I'm staying.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GENDRY: You're what?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	HOT PIE: I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of "Winterhell".
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: Winterfell.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	HOT PIE: You sure?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: I'm sure.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	Hot PIE: Well, I made you something.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	HOT PIE hands ARYA the bread that he baked. It is shaped like an animal of some sort.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: What is it?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	HOT PIE:  It's a wolf.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GENDRY: Yes, it is.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: That's the tail?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	HOT PIE: Yeah.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GENDRY: Well, be safe.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	HOT PIE: Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GENDRY: You don't burn your fingers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GENDRY pats HOT PIE's shoulder, grabs his pack, and exits.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ARYA: Good-bye, Hot Pie.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CATELYN: A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CATELYN: I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CATELYN: I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CATELYN: Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CATELYN begins to weep. BRYNDEN sits to comfort her.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRYNDEN: You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CATELYN: (sighs)

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TALISA tends to MARTYN LANNISTER's arm while WILLEM LANNISTER looks on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MARTYN: You're Robb Stark's wife.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TALISA: Hold still.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MARTYN: Is it true what they say about him?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TALISA: I don't know. What do they say about him?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MARTYN: That he can turn into a wolf at night.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TALISA: True.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MARTYN: And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TALISA: True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MARTYN: Martyn Lannister.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TALISA: Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE RAYDER, TORMUND GIANTSBANE, JON SNOW, YGRITTE, and ORELL walk through a winter storm. MANCE kneels down.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE: Always the artists.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The camera pans up to reveal a huge spiral of horse carcasses, dismembered and frozen in a horrific but almost beautiful.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JON: It's only horses. No men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	YGRITTE: You said there was dead crows.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ORELL: There was.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE: How many men were here?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JON: About three hundred.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE: And you know what those men are now?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JON: (nods)
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE: We're all the same to them - meat for their army.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JON: Do you think anyone got away?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE: It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TORMUND: We're finally going to war, old friend?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE: Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE and TORMUND embrace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TORMUND:  We'll meet again.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE:  Aye. If you do your job. Ah.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ORELL: How will we see your signal?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MANCE: Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	EXT: CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The Night's Watch continues its brutal march. They have reached a large farmhouse complex. As they approach, the women scatter and flee. SAMWELL TARLY sees the white direwolf nearby.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	SAM: Ghost?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	They approach the main doorway, led by LORD COMMANDER JEOR MORMONT and are met by CRASTER.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER: What have we here? Frozen crows?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JEOR: We've come a long way.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER: Smaller flock than you went north with.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JEOR: We can talk inside.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER: Oh, can we?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER takes stock in silence. The Night's Watch is ready to force their way in, if necessary.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	INT: CRASTER'S KEEP
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The men sit by the fire in a tense silence. Nearby, a woman wails. Some younger girls observe from the rafters. Women tend to the animals outside.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	WOMAN: They need some water.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	WOMAN #2: Tether it and I'll be inside.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER: Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KARL TANNER: Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER: Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JEOR: You are a godly man?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER: I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The woman continues to wail in another room. Another woman pours some water for CRASTER.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER: Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. (Pointing to SAM) And she's almost as fat as this one here.  Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CRASTER laughs uncontrollably. SAM stands and exits.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CUT TO: CRASTER'S KEEP, COURTYARD
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	SAM walks outside. He follows the sound of the wailing, and peers into the small hut where GILLY is giving birth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	WOMAN: Here we are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	WOMAN #2: Sharpen these for me, would ya?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	WOMAN #3: I see the head. Push.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	WOMAN: That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The baby comes and the women tend to the newborn.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GILLY: (desperate) What is it? What is it?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GILLY sees that the baby is a boy and her face falls. Then she notices SAM peering in. He exits quickly.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON GREYJOY is still hooded and strapped to the cross. The door clanks open. RAMSAY enters, removes the hood and starts to undo THEON's bindings.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSAY: Keep quiet.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON groans and RAMSEY frees him, and lowers him to the floor. THEON takes a desperate drink of water from the flask that RAMSEY offers. He tries to stand.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSEY: If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON: I can ride.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSAY: You're sure?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSEY douses the light as they prepare to leave.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON painfully mounts the house that RAMSAY has procured.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSAY: Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSAY: We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS BARATHEON and MELISANDRE walk to the craggy shore where some men hold a boat at the ready.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN: Come on back.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS: You refuse to tell me where you're going?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS:  How long will you be gone?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: I don't know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS: You're abandoning me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire.  I am sworn to serve you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS:  Then serve me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: When I return, you will understand.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE starts to walk away, but STANNIS stops her.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS: My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: I cannot.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS: Why?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS: I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	He clasps her to him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS: (whispering) I want you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE does not respond, and he is disappointed. She looks at STANNIS with concern.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: Your fires burn low, my king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	He starts to walk away.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: There is another way. A better way.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS: You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE:  Yes.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	STANNIS:  I'm the one true king.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MELISANDRE: You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	She walks to the boat.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS TARGARYEN, SER JORAH MORMONT, and SER BARRISTAN SELMY walk along the shoreline parapet in the bright sun. A series of tortured slaves on crucifixes line the walkway.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: To whom?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Give me your water.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH gives DAENERYS his canteen. She steps up to a bloodied man and offers a drink. He refuses.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Here, drink.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: And what is she to do for soldiers?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS hands back the canteen, and they continue their walk.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: Three.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH:  Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: (shakes his head)
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS, JORAH, and BARRISTAN stand before a raised platform where KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ and GREIZHEN sit and MISSANDEI stands.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: They did not. I want to buy them all.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian) She wants to buy them all.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GREIZHEN: (speaking Valerian) If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) The slut cannot pay for all of this.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) Her ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: The gold you have left is worth ten.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) What is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: But good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: The Dothraki you have with you-
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) I will give her three for those.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS has been looking at the young enslaved children who watch from above.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: I have dragons. I'll give you one.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian)
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS looks shocked.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: Khaleesi, please.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS approaches the platform.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: Three dragons.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS:  One.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS:  Two.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: One.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS consults with GREIZHEN.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian)
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: They want the biggest one.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS:  Done.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KRAZNYS:  Done.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian) She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS strides purposefully. JORAH and BARRISTAN try to keep up.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH: Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BARRISTAN: Aegon Targaryen proved that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JORAH and BARRISTAN nod. DAENERYS walks away and joins MISSANDEI
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Do you have a name?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: No, Your Grace. No family living.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MISSANDEI: Valar morghulis.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	DAENERYS: Yes, all men must die. But we are not men.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROS kneels at a hidden compartment in the floor. She hands PODRICK PAYNE a series of ledgers. He admires her assets. She notices.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Not for bastards.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	ROS: That's all of them, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: Thank you, my dear.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK:  Yes, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK wheels the ledges away in a cart. ROS exits as well.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: You should have him knighted.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: If only the Master of Coin had such power.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: We don't. I did fuck her once.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER:  I know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION:  But we don't.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: Keep a low profile.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: Well, you are richer than I am.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Good point.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LITTLEFINGER: They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	CUT TO: HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION walks into the hall. SER BRONN OF THE BLACKWATER is chatting with a prostitute, and PODRICK stands by his wagon.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Come on, I'm here later. Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN hops down and follows TYRION. BRONN trails with the wagon.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: You think all reading is dull reading.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: Yes, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Podrick.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: Yes, my lord?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	They open a door and enter a chamber. GENNA, naked, lies on the bed.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: No, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION:  Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: She's not bad with second-timers, either.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: Uh, my lord
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	GENNA walks over to PODRICK, smiling, and places her hands on him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION walks further into the chamber, and pushes aside a curtain, revealing the naked MAREI.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAREI walks over to PRODICK, and begins to help KALYA to undress him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAREI: He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION reveals the acrobatic KAYLA, who crawls to join the other.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: My lord, I don't even
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	KAYLA performs an impressive and seductive back bend for PODRICK.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Be back in time for my supper.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION leaves a small purse. BRONN wheels out the cart as he and TYRION exit.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Pace yourself, lad.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	INT. TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION pours over the ledgers. BRONN wanders through the room, inspecting various objects, not impressed by any.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Let me guess. He's not a magician.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: No.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN:  He's stealing it?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Worse, he's borrowing it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: What's wrong with that?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: And what if I don't?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Well, you have to.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: But what if I don't?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK enters.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: The lad's practically skipping.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK returns the purse to TYRION.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: He's a squire. You don't pay him.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: They wouldn't take it, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: What did you tell them?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: I didn't tell them anything.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION:  What did you do to them?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: Lots of things.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: And they seemed to like these things?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK: Yes, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Only they weren't paid.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRONN: What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Is that what you're telling us?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	PODRICK doesn't deny it.>/i>
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION: Sit down, Podrick.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	TYRION grabs some wine. BRONN clears the table and has PODRICK sit.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON rides at a clip. He looks in anticipation for his sister. An arrow flies past his head, and he gasps. He cannot figure out where the arrow came from. Over the rise, four mounted soldiers appear, galloping towards him. THEON spurs on his mount in panic.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON: Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The soldiers close the distance to THEON. His horse jumps a broken wall as he rides into the trees. The soldiers give chase close behind. One swings a mace, and another shoots an arrow that zips past. One soldier veers off from the others into the woods, in an attempt to cut off THEON's escape.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	SOLDIER: Ha! Ha!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	They continue to fire at THEON. They all must duck to avoid a low branch. The last soldier has succeeded in his shortcut. He charges at THEON and unseats him with a powerful blow from his morningstar. THEON falls to the ground and gasps in pain. The soldiers surround him, and dismount. THEON tries to get to his feet, but a SOLDIER kicks him back to the ground.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	SOLDIER #1: You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	One soldier places one foot on THEON's head to hold him down. Two others help.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	SOLDIER #2: Take off his pants.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	They strip down him pants to reveal his ass. THEON squirms in protest.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON: No! No! No, no, no!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	SOLDIER #3: I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON: No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	As the soldier stands above him, an arrow pierces his heart from behind. He staggers and turns, confused.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON: No, please! No! No!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	A second arrow pierces the soldier's chest, and he falls to his knees. The others realize that they are under attack and start to flee. They are taken down quickly by arrows. THEON looks up, then works up his pants. RAMSAY approaches, bow in hand. The first soldier that he shot is still on his knees, in shock. RAMSAY stops in front of him, and reaches for another arrow.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	SOLDIER #2: You little bastard.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSAY notches the arrow, aims at the soldier's head, and executes him. THEON scrambles backwards in fear as RAMSAY approaches him. RAMSAY extends his hand, gently.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSAY: Come, my lord.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	THEON grasps his hand, and RAMSAY brings him to his feet.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	RAMSAY: You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	They walk away together, THEON limping.

s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE's men have made camp for the night. BRIENNE and JAIME are bound to trees while the men are gathered around a nearby fire.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE approaches. Two men help BRIENNE to her feet.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE headbutts one of the four men around her. But with her hands bound, she has no chance. The men hold her and punch her into submission.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN: You're only making it worse.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE headbutts him again, and gets another series of blows in return.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN: Come on!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE yells and screams as they lead her away.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: You know who she is, don't you?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN: I'm gonna cut your throat!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: I know what they are.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE screams and men yell in the distance while LOCKE processes this information. Then he turns towards his men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Bring her back here.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN: Yes, my lord. Get up.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN #2:  Come on.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN #3: Come on, on your feet.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Unbesmirched.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: Not defiled.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Fancy word for a fancy man.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: I bet you did.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The men tie BRIENNE to her tree once again. JAIME looks at her.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	BRIENNE: (screams)
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Aye, you have both.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Hard to argue with that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	MAN: Come on, men.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	The men unchain Jaime.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: I'm famished, actually.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: Well, I do like partridge.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE helps him up. JAIME groans from his soreness. BRIENNE watches them walk away towards the fire.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME: Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	One of the men kick JAIME's knees out from under him. He falls to the ground.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: On the stump.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	Another man forces JAIME's right hand onto the stump while the others hold him down. LOCKE grabs JAIME's face and draws the large carving knife, then places its point at Jaime's eye.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME:  My father-
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME:  Don't.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE:  Have you got something to say?
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	JAIME does not respond.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	Locke stands back up, releasing Jaime's face and withdrawing the knife.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE: Here, this should help you remember.
s03e03	Walk of Punishment	LOCKE winds up and cleaves the huge knife through JAIME's wrist in a single blow. JAIME looks with disbelief at his severed hand, and then screams in agony.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MAN: How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LOCKE: Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JAIME's horse drifts leftward and JAIME starts to bend and teeter over.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JAIME falls off his horse, face first into the mud. He grunts and searches for purchase with his left hand.  LOCKE halts the party with a signal and dismounts. JAIME struggles to his feet.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JAIME: (desperately) Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	One of LOCKE's men approaches. He opens his canteen, then pours it out on JAIME's filthy head. The men laugh, and BRIENNE is disgusted. LOCKE comes closer.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LOCKE: Oh, enough. Here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LOCKE gives JAIME his canteen. JAIME gulps it down as quickly as he can.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LOCKE: Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The men laugh, and JAIME doubles over, coughing and spitting out the piss. A man comes to help him up and JAIME sees his opportunity. JAIME elbows him in the face and grabs the man's sword as he falls. LOCKE draws his weapon, as do some of his men. They surround JAIME. The Kingslayer makes some awkward left-handed blows that are easily parried. There are too many of them. Another man kicks JAIME down from behind, back into the mud. The men laugh. BRIENNE has had enough.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: Stop!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE slides off her horse. JAIME picks up the sword and starts swinging at the men again. BRIENNE kicks down the man who turns to stop her, while JAIME takes a strong punch to the face. BRIENNE is halted by two drawn swords.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MAN: Far enough.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The men encircling JAIME continue to toy with him, landing blows when his back is turned. He falls into the black mud again. LOCKE comes to him, and kicks him repeatedly. BRIENNE fumes. LOCKE steps on JAIME's left hand until he finally relents his grip on the sword. LOCKE kicks him again, leaving JAIME sprawled in the mud. The fight has left the Kingslayer. LOCKE kneels down and puts his face threatening close to JAIME's.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LOCKE: Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LOCKE stands and the men pull BRIENNE back to the horses.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Oh, always in confidence.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS works to open a large crate with a crowbar
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYRION: About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYRION: I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: End your life?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYRION: I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Proof? Will there be a trial?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYRION: I need to know.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYRION: I don't know. Do I?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS pauses from his efforts to open the crate.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYRION: Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: You do not possess at the moment.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	Varys puts down the crowbar and moves to a basin to wash his hands and freshen up.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS removes the top of the crate. He and TYRION peer in. VARYS protects his nose from the stink. TYRION is aghast.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYRION: The sorcerer.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The sorcerer lies helplessly in the crate. His mouth has been sewn shut long ago. He mumbles desperately behind his sewn mouth.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	EXT: WOODS, SOMEWHERE
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRAN STARK runs through the woods. A raven caws overhead. BRAN comes upon a godswood. JOJEN REED appears by his side.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOJEN: You have to go after him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRAN: How?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOJEN: You know how.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRAN climbs to the high branches of the godswood until he finds the raven. He balances his way carefully to the raven.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CATELYN: Brandon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CATELYN STARK appears behind him in the tree.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRAN: Mother.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CATELYN: How many times have I told you? No climbing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRAN: Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CATELYN grabs him roughly.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CATELYN: I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	She shakes BRAN as her voice rises in volume.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CATELYN: Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CATELYN shakes BRAN so hard that he looses his footing and he falls from the tree.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRAN: Mother! Mother!

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Is he very large?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Extraordinary.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: (nods)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: What did he do to them?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: So what did they say?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: They said it was hard to describe.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS pours her some wine.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: What makes you say so?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: His shipboard inventory.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS produces a scroll and hands it to VARYS. He opens it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: Former profession.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: He's not interested in them, my lord.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: How do you know?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ROS: Because I'm one of his girls.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Prodigies in odd places indeed.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KING JOFFREY BARATHEON, LADY MARGAERY TYRELL, QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER, and LADY OLENNA TYRELL walk through the Sept of Baelor. JOFFREY is showing MARGAERY where the previous rulers of Westeros are buried while CERSEI and OLENNA discuss the upcoming wedding.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY: Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats seven hundred comfortably.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA:  There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: There aren't more than seven hundred people of any importance.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the seven hundred to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY: Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame, they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: (laughs)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY: He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY: The tomb's just up here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: This is so exciting.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY and MARGAERY exit.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: You were married here, Your Grace?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Yes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Must seem like only yesterday.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Seems like a lifetime ago.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Your husband, was he buried here as well?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Such a tragedy.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: (chuckles)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: I told him to stay out of Robert's Rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: And yet the world belongs to them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: (laughs)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: The gods have seen fit to make it so.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CUT TO: THE TOMBS
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY: My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY: I couldn't agree more.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	They hear the sounds of a shouting crowd outside the Sept.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY: Open the doors.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The doors open.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Joffrey. Wait.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JOFFREY and MARGAERY step out of the sept.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	WOMAN: Lady Margaery!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	WOMAN #2: Lady Margaery!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	WOMAN #3: Bless you, Lady Margaery!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY waves to the crowd.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: She sent you to save me?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: Why would you risk your life for me?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, 'That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.' And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: I- I don't know, my lord. They- they never told me much.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CUT TO: NORTHERN WOODS, LATER
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON and RAMSAY leap over a wall and move furtively along it in the rain. They approach a small castle.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY opens the lower gate leading into the castle. It leads to a long hallway.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: (chuckles)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: What is it?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: What did he tell you to do?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: He lorded it over you?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	They reach another gate. RAMSAY works to open it with his keys.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY finally has worked the gate open.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: The Stark boys?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: Maybe it's not too late.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: Not everything, my lord. She's up here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON and RAMSAY continue past the gate and through some doors. The room is black.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: Yara.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: Shh. Wait.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY lights a torch. The room brightens to reveal the X-shaped cross on which THEON had been tortured.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: I brought him back. He killed the others.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON is stunned.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: What? No, I didn't.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	Some guards appear behind THEON. One grabs his shoulder, spins him and punches him in the gut.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THEON: You can't! No, please stop! No!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The two guards wrestle THEON back onto the cross. He sobs and yells.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAMSAY: Put him back where he belongs.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE sits, bound and thinking, her brow still furrowed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: Eat. What are you doing?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JAIME: I'm dying.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: You can't die. You need to live to take revenge.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JAIME: I don't care about revenge.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JAIME: Misfor- misfortune?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: You lost your hand.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JAIME: My sword hand. I was that hand.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: You have a taste- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE and JAIME sit in silence. JAIME reaches for the bread and takes a bite.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BRIENNE: I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me?

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LORD TYWIN LANNISTER writes while CERSEI looks on, impatiently.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: You wanted to speak to me?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Yes, about Jaime.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: What about him?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: You started a war.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Whatever you can.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: Whatever I can.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN seals the letter he finished and starts another one.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: You're still here.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Yes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: Why?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: All right. Contribute.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: The Tyrells are a problem.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN: Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	TYWIN goes back to writing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CERSEI: Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA sits thinking.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MAID: Do you like it, Nana?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong- ha, that strikes fear in the heart.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS approaches.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The maids exit and VARYS arrives.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: A little obvious, perhaps.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Might I sit?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Is she?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS moves to leave.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS and OLENNA walk together.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Which is Sansa Stark?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: How?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: And why have you come to me with this matter?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: (laughs)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: You are a clever man, Lord Varys.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	VARYS: You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	OLENNA: One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: (to the guards) We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The two guards leave.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: What did you pray for?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: I can't tell you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: I'm sorry, I just can't.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: (laughs)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: Porridge plague?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: But that's awful.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: (nods, laughs)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: You're- I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: Don't say that. No, you're not.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: So what happened to Alanna?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	They arrive at another overlook.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY takes both of SANSA's hands.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: I want us to be friends, good friends.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: That would make me very happy.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: I- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MARGAERY: The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras... Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SANSA: (nods)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	EXT: CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	A funeral pyre blazes in the night.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from- where did he come from?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DOLOROUS EDD: Down White Harbor way.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ALL: And now his watch has ended.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: And now his watch has ended.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	LORD COMMANDER JEOR MORMONT exits.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	GRENN: Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST: It wasn't his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SAM: Craster's got his daughters to feed.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST: You on his side?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SAM: We can't just show up and steal all his food. We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST: The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	EDDISON: Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The pyre burns.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	INT: CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER eats and JEOR writes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my ninety-ninth. You ever meet a man with ninety-nine sons?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: (shakes his head)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: And more daughters than I can count.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: I'm glad for you.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The Night's Watchmen return to warm themselves, including SAM, GRENN, DOLOROUS EDD, RAST, and KARL TANNER.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: Ah. They're as strong as they're gonna get. Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER: Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: Wait outside.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER: It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: My wives gave you bread.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER: There's sawdust in the bread.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER: I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR stands.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: I told you to wait outside.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST: He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER stands in rage.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST: So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: Enough! Out!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: I am a godly man.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST: You're a stingy bastard!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER grabs an ax from the wall approaches KARL TANNER.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER: Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR grabs RAST and forces him to exit.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER: You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CRASTER raises his ax and attacks KARL TANNER.  KARL grabs his arm and stabs him in the belly. CRASTER gurgles and chokes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: The gods will curse us for this. By all the laws-
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER hits one of CRASTER's wives. He then picks her up from the ground, and she does not resist. He puts his knife to her throat.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER: There are no laws beyond the Wall. Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR draws his sword.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR: Unhand her.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KARL TANNER drops the woman and gets ready to face off with JEOR.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	JEOR:  I shall have your head for this.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST stabs JEOR from behind. JEOR's hands go weak, and he drops his sword. GRENN charges KARL TANNER, and they wrestle for control of the knife. Women and men shout as the fight escalates. JEOR turns to face RAST, grabs him by the throat, lifts and pins him against a post. SAM flees to the outside and picks up a sword amidst the chaos. CRASTER lies dead on the floor. JEOR continues to choke RAST, until he suddenly spits up a mouthful of blood, and collapses to the floor. RAST comes to him and savagely stabs JEOR again and again.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CUT TO: GILLY'S QUARTERS
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SAM enters.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SAM: Quickly. Quickly.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	GILLY: What's happening? I'm not going out there.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	SAM: No, we have to go. Now!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The baby cries, and they leave the hut to meet the chaos.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	GILLY: Follow me. I know the best way. Come on.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	GILLY and SAM run from the keep, into the woods.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	RAST: Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	EXT: THE RIVERLANDS
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The Brotherhood without Banners rides through the woods. A hooded ARYA STARK rides with THOROS. They pass a series of men serving as lookouts.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ARYA: Can I take this hood off yet?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS: I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	They hail the lookouts.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MAN: Halt!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS lifts ARYA's hood to reveal her mouth and offers her a drink.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ARYA: What is it?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS: Blackstrap rum.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	He lets her smell it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ARYA: Ugh!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS: Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	Nearby, GENDRY is also hooded.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	GENDRY: I'd have some.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS: Let's go home.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CUT TO: THE MOUTH OF A CAVEThe Brotherhood enters, single file, leading the hooded GENDRY, ARYA, and THE HOUND. They reach the main chamber and remove the hoods.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	GENDRY: What is this place?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS: Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: You look like a bunch of swineherds.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ANGUY: Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC DONDARRION enters.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: And I won't see them again.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE  HOUND spits in disgust.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: You're fighting for ghosts.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: You found god? Is that it?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS: You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ANGUY: And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THOROS: House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ANGUY: Murder is a crime.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ARYA: You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: Aye, he was a bleeder.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: You don't deny killing this boy?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	ARYA: That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	THE HOUND: So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BERIC: Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	A pair of great doors open. DAENERYS TARGARYEN, MISSANDEI, SER JORAH MORMONT, and SER BARRISTAN SELMY enter the large and bustling courtyard, populated by guards and townfolk. Two guards move through the square, carrying a litter containing one of DAENERYS's dragons.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MISSANDEI: The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	They come to the massive field where the thousands of Unsullied stand at attention. KRASZYS and GREIZHEN stand before them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MISSANDEI: And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS walks back to the woven crate containing her dragon. She opens the front and DROGON comes out, screeching. DAENERYS holds onto the chain attached to the dragon's foot as it takes flight and hovers above her. She hands the chain to KRAZNYS, who struggles against the strength of the small dragon. He smiles greedily, and hands her the whip that represents command of the Unsullied.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: Is it done, then? They belong to me?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MISSANDEI: (speaks Valyrian)
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) It is done.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MISSANDEI: It is done.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) She holds the whip.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	MISSANDEI: You hold the whip.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) The bitch has her army.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS turns slowly and walks to the unsullied. DROGON's unhappy screeching increases.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Unsullied!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The Unsullied come to attention. MISSANDEI is surprised that DAENERYS speaks Valyrian. KRAZNYS struggles against the dragon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Forward march!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The Unsullied march.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Halt!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The Unsullied halt. KRAZNYS tries to control the dragon.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) Tell the bitch her beast won't come.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) A dragon is not a slave.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) You speak Valyrian?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS turns to the Unsullied.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	An Unsullied pierces a slave master though the heart with his spear. KRAZNYS looks on in panic.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) I am your master.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	BARRISTAN draws his sword as the Unsullied follow DAENERYS's command.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	KRAZNYS: (screaming Valyrian) Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: Dracarys.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DROGON unleashes his fire breath, consuming KRAZNYS, who screams in agony as he burns. The Unsullied attack and quickly overwhelm the guards. DROGON flies free, spouting fire above the courtyard.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	The courtyard is filled with smoke and charred bodies. JORAH surveys the carnage and reaches DAENERYS. She walks forward to inspect he Unsullied, who are back in formation. She mounts a white horse, and rides among them.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	One Unsullied begins tapping his spear rhythmically in the sand. Soon others join him, and more still until the sound becomes thunderous and unanimous. JORAH and BARRISTAN look on.
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD
s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	DAENERYS rides away from the main gate with her Dothraki and  with MISSANDEI, JORAH, and BARRISTAN. The eight thousand Unsullied march behind her. She tosses away the whip. The three dragons fly overhead.

s03e04	And Now His Watch Is Ended	“The Night’s Watch takes stock. Varys meets his better. Arya is taken to the commander of the Brotherhood. Dany exchanges a chain for a whip.”
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	INT: RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS OF MYR looks into the fire.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Lord, cast your light upon us.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	MEN: Lord of Light, defend us.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ANGUY unbinds SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Show us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	MEN: For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THE HOUND readies his sword and loosens for battle. LORD BERIC DONDARRION kneels before THOROS. BERIC offers his left hand, and THOROS slices open a long gash in his palm. He then places the sword in BERIC's right hand. BERIC slides the blade across the open wound and the weapon erupts in flame.  THE HOUND is taken aback. Both men take up shields and they set to battle. BERIC gets first advantage, with the flames putting fear in the eyes of THE HOUND. THE HOUND finds his rhythm and the battle becomes more even. BERIC dodges a blow and shoulders THE HOUND to stumble into a fire, sparks erupting. THE HOUND is enraged and makes a poorly chosen charge. He ends up on his knees.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Get back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS pushes LADY ARYA STARK away as the fight comes close to them. THE HOUND regains his footing and begins a brutal onslaught, shattering BERIC's shield. BERIC stumbles and regroups, pushing THE HOUND back with a series of two-handed swings. THE HOUND falls onto his back, and BERIC's blow set his shield aflame. THE HOUND launches a wild counter attack while the crowd becomes more excited, and begins to chant.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	MEN: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THE HOUND tries to douse his shield, but it continues to burn.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: Kill him!
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	After parrying blows, THE HOUND elbows BERIC in the gut. He stumbles backwards.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THE HOUND: (shouts)
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THE HOUND unleashes an overhead swing with all his might. BERIC blocks with his flaming sword, but THE HOUND's powerful blow breaks the blade and cleaves deeply into BERIC's shoulder and torso. BERIC's eyes roll and he falls to the ground, dead. ARYA is distraught and THOROS launches himself onto BERIC.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THE HOUND: (shouts)
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THE HOUND falls to the ground and smashes his shield to the ground, trying to choke the flames.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA  spins backwards and takes a man's knife.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	GENDRY: Arya, don't!
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Bring him back from death and darkness
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA runs towards THE HOUND, but GENDRY intercepts her and tackles her off of her feet.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: No! Let go of me! Let me go!

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TORMUND: Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL: How often do these patrols go out?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL: You'd like to know that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TORMUND: (sighs) There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Three.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL: You sure of that?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: (nods)
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL: Which three?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Castle Black.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL: Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TORMUND: How many men remain in Castle Black?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: A thousand.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL: Liar.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON drops his bundle and steps towards Orell.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: He's no crow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL: Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE draws her dagger.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: I'm not afraid of you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TORMUND stands and throws ORELL to the ground. He faces JON.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TORMUND: I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: A thousand men.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ORELL stands up.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TORMUND: We'll find out soon enough.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TORMUND walks away. JON and YGRITTE walk, quick and agitated, through the camp.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: I don't need you to protect me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE takes JON's sword and starts to run. JON gives chase.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Give it back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	She stops by the fire and picks up a torch.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	She turns and runs. JON runs after her. YGRITTE does not heed his cries.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Ygritte! Ygritte!
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE reaches a cave. She looks back and smiles before entering.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	INT: THE CAVE
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON chases YGRITTE into the cave. YGRITTE leans his sword against a rock by a large pool. Water falls in a sheet from above. She puts down the torch, then removes her bow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	She takes off her shoes.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Ygritte.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: We shouldn't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: We should.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE tries to kiss JON. He resists her at first, but he cannot fight his feelings. They embrace and passionately kiss.  He kisses her neck, her breasts and continues downward.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE moans.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	They embrace and caress.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Hmm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: You seemed to like it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: There's been no one else. Only you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: A maid. You were a maid.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: What do you think?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Who was he?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JON: Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE sits astride JON.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: I'm not done with you yet.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	They kiss.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: How long's it been since you had a bath?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE hops up and jumps into the pool beside the cascading water. Jon joins her and they kiss again.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	YGRITTE: Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROOSE BOLTON: You've lost a hand.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LOCKE: No, my lord, he has it here.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LOCKE taunts JAIME with the dismembered hand tied around his neck. ROOSE pulls the hand from around JAIME's neck and hands it to LOCKE.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROOSE BOLTON: Take this away.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LOCKE: Send it to his father?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROOSE BOLTON: You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROOSE BOLTON: Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE is cut free.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Is there word from the capital?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROOSE BOLTON: You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME falls to his knees in relief.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROOSE BOLTON: Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Will I die?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	QYBURN: No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	QYBURN: The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME chokes QYBURN to make his point, then relents.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: I don't need my right hand to kill you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	QYBURN: I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Mmm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	QYBURN: With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: No milk of the poppy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	QYBURN: There will be pain.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: I'll scream.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	QYBURN: Quite a bit of pain.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: I'll scream loudly.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: Myself, I often find them a hindrance.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: I shall do my best.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	PODRICK exits.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: Naturally.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: I understand that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: Good.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: And?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: And we're at war, Lady Olenna.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: Yes, and maintaining supply lines-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: I would.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: And traditionally paid for by the royal family.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLENNA: Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: Quite sufficient. Thank you.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA stands by the fire. THOROS lies nearby.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Don't think of it that way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: But it is that way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: It is. And it isn't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: More is than isn't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: So why don't you?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: We need the gold.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC enters and sits. ARYA looks uncomfortable.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: Do I frighten you, child?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: I thought he killed you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: He did.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: But how?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: How many times?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Five, I think. No, this makes six.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: Six.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC shows ARYA the scar on his chest.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: Then I was stabbed in the belly.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC shows ARYA his right eye, sewn shut behind his eye patch.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: And the Hound makes six.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	THOROS: I don't think it works that way, child.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BERIC: He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ARYA: I would. You're alive.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	The door opens and KING STANNIS BARATHEON enters. He stands at the threshold, silently.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: My lady.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE nods in greeting.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: I meant to come sooner. The battle-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: Yes, of course.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: I believed that once.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: You're doing god's work.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE walks past STANNIS toward three specimen jars. Each contains a stillborn baby in a cloudy, green liquid.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: That's not true.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: She's my daughter. I want to see her.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SELYSE: You are a king. You don't need my permission.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: Shireen.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: Father!
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN rushes up and hugs STANNIS. He sighs and does not return her embrace. She looks up at him, revealing the greyscale that has consumed the left side of her face.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: You've grown since I last saw you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	She pulls him to sit on the bed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: He did. He fought bravely.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: He won't be visiting, child.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: Why not? He's my friend. Look.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN gets up and opens a nearby drawer. She returns with a carved two-masted boat.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	STANNIS: Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAMIE has entered with a squire. BRIENNE is surprised.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: What are you doing here?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	The squire helps JAIME undress. We see JAIME's stubbed wrist, wrapped cleanly and tightly.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Now get out.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	The squire exits. JAIME removes his trousers and BRIENNE looks away in modesty. JAIME moves to enter the tub with BRIENNE.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: There's another tub.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BREINNE moves to the far corner of the tub, but JAIME walks to join her. He steps into the water.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: Why should I care how you die?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE stands bold and naked, challenging JAIME to continue. He is shamed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: Don't you mock me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: You need trust to have a truce.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: I trust you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE sits, appeased, but fuming.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: Of course.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE stares, wide-eyed, and doesn't answer.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME is exhausted after his speech. He breaths heavily.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME tries to stand, but collapses into BRIENNE's arms.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BRIENNE: Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JAIME: Jaime. My name is Jaime.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: Bert?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS comes to the bars to talk.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: Aye. So they did.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: Take it. I have more.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: My lady, I can't read the words.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: You can't?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: (shakes his head)
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: No. No. No.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: It's easy. It'll be fun.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: Go. We can't.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAVOS: (laughs) I wouldn't know where to start.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SHIREEN: At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: (laughs)
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH and BARRISTAN lead their horses to water.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: You swore an oath.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	MISSANDEI: All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	DAENERYS: (speaks Valeryan) From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	GREY WORM: (speaks Valeryan) "Grey Worm" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: I didn't sit on the small council.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	They mount their horses.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	They begin to ride alongside the marching Dothraki and Unsullied.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: Mm-hmm.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: Which men do you have in mind?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	JORAH: You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	BARRISTAN: If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TALISA: Don't let him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB: What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TALISA: We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB: Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TALISA: Give them a new purpose.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB: What?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TALISA: Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB takes her hand and uses it to point out locations on the large map.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TALISA: What is it?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB: I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB moves one piece to take another on the map.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB: And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TALISA: Can you do it?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	ROBB: I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.

s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLYVAR starts to undo the straps of LORAS' practice armor.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLYVAR: I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LORAS: (chuckles)
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	Their eyes meet.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CUT TO: LORAS's chambers
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LORAS and OLYVAR lie a bed in passionate and hungry embrace. OLYVAR Is nude.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LORAS: How did you know?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLYVAR: Know what?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LORAS: That I wanted to.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLYVAR stands to get a drink.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LORAS: My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLYVAR: They rarely do, in my experience.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LORAS approaches behind him.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LORAS: You have a good deal of experience, do you?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLYVAR: With the husbands.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	They embrace and return to bed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	INT: LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: That didn't take long.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	OLYVAR: Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	EXT: KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA look out at a sailing ship in the bay.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA: What is?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA: Is it?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: Lady Margaery wears it that way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA: Many ladies wear it this way.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA: You still want me to come with you?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA: Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA: I do, Lord Baelish.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: Petyr.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	SANSA: Petyr.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER kisses her hand.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER: We'll speak again when I return.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	LITTLEFINGER exits.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	INT: TYWIN'S CHAMBERS
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION enters, carrying a large tome. He spies CERSEI and pauses.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: You're late.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: What's she doing here?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Our business concerns her, too. Sit.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION sits at the table.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: (to Cersei) Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Your jokes are not appreciated.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: It wasn't my best, but-
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: And how do we do that?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: Wonderful.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: (amused) Yes, it is.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION realizes TYWIN's intent to marry him to SANSA.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: You can't mean it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: I can and I do.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: She's a child!
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: And if I refuse?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYRION: I was wed. Or don't you remember?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Only too well.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: What do you mean?
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: You'll marry Ser Loras.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: I will not.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: No, I won't do it.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	CERSEI: Father, don't make me do it again, please.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN slams his fist on the table and rises.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN: Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
s03e05	Kissed by Fire	TYWIN exits. Both CERSEI and TYRION brood.

s03e06	The Climb	EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL, NIGHT
s03e06	The Climb	SAMWELL TARLY tends to the fire while GILLY sits nearby, cradling her baby.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: You've got too much wood in there.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: But the more wood, the bigger the fire.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM removes the log. The fire quickly comes to life.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: Huh. You know your fires.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM sits.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: Someone built your fires for you growing up?
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: I knew you were highborn.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM pulls out the dragonglass knife.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: What does it do?
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: How much longer?
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: Not so far. A few more days.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: Is the Wall as big as they say?
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: You're playing with me.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: Do you sing?
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: No. No, no, no. Not very well.
s03e06	The Climb	GILLY: Sing me a song.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: Oh, all right. Let's see.
s03e06	The Climb	The baby fusses.
s03e06	The Climb	SAM: Oh ahem.

s03e06	The Climb	EXT: THE NORTH, MORNING
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA REED skins a rabbit while OSHA looks on.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: That's not how you skin a rabbit.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: I know how to skin a rabbit.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: Not by the looks of it.
s03e06	The Climb	LORD BRAN STARK sits, back to a tree nearby. OSHA skins another rabbit in a quick motion and twists its head off.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: I didn't see any game before I got here.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: You learn how to use your fists, though.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: I had someone else in mind.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: Well, someone else is sitting right here.
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: Some of us are just a little better.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA and MEERA stand, posturing for a fight.
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: Stop it!
s03e06	The Climb	HODOR: Hodor.
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA and MEERA kneel and get back to work.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: I said so, didn't I?
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: Osha!
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: You're a good little hunter.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you.
s03e06	The Climb	OSHA: Don't push me.
s03e06	The Climb	JOJEN REED begins to spasm in his sleep. MEERA goes to him and places a leather belt between his teeth. The spasm continues.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: Shh. I'm right here with you.
s03e06	The Climb	RICKON STARK wakes.
s03e06	The Climb	RICKON: What's happening?
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: I'm right here with you.
s03e06	The Climb	RICKON: What's wrong with him?
s03e06	The Climb	JOJEN's fit worsens, his eyes now open.
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: The visions take their toll.
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: He's having one now?
s03e06	The Climb	MEERA: (nods)
s03e06	The Climb	JOJEN cones to his senses and sits up.
s03e06	The Climb	JOJEN: I saw Jon Snow.
s03e06	The Climb	BRAN: You saw him? At Castle Black?
s03e06	The Climb	JOJEN: He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
s03e06	The Climb	EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL
s03e06	The Climb	The Wildlings pack up their camp in the woods. TORMUND GIANTSBANE, ORELL, JON SNOW, and YGRITTE are among them.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND: Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND exits.
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL: (to Jon) Your flock gets smaller every year.
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL exits.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: You ever climbed it before?
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: No. But Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: Aren't you?
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down.
s03e06	The Climb	JON sits. YGRITTE hands him some climbing cleats to strap onto his boots.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: You kill someone for them?
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.
s03e06	The Climb	They laugh.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: Can we not talk about that here?
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: 'Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.'
s03e06	The Climb	JON: Did I seem scared the other day?
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: You were trembling like a leaf.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: Only in the beginning.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: What secret?
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
s03e06	The Climb	JON freezes. YGRITTE comes closer, furtively.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.
s03e06	The Climb	She moves to sit next to him.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: I won't.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND returns. He hands JON a climbing axe.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND: Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.
s03e06	The Climb	EXT: RIVERLANDS, WOODS
s03e06	The Climb	LADY ARYA STARK practices with a bow, shooting arrows into a straw man. She says a name with each arrow she lets fly. ANGUY watches, while THOROS OF MYR sit nearby, drinking.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA pulls back the bow and ANGUY corrects her form.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA lowers the bow.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: What?
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: But I have to aim.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: Never aim.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: Never aim?
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA draws the bow.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: There's someone out there.
s03e06	The Climb	A party of mounted travelers approaches. ANGUY takes the bow and meets them on the path.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: That's about far enough.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE lowers her red hood.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: We come as friends.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: Valar morghulis.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: Valar dohaeris. (speaks Valyrian) I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) You are Thoros of Myr.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: (nods)
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: (speaks Valyrian) I failed.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: (speaks Valyrian) You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?
s03e06	The Climb	EXT: RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS
s03e06	The Climb	LORD BERIC DONDARRION sits by the fire. MELISANDRE and THOROS enter. He stands.
s03e06	The Climb	BERIC: Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: Lucky for the ladies.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE scans BERIC with both her eyes and her hand. She is fascinated by his scars.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: How many times has the Lord brought him back?
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: Six.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: (speaks Valerian) That's not possible.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: (speaks Valerian) The Lord has smiled upon me.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: (speaks Valerian) You should not have this power.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: (speaks Valerian) I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS sits and begins to drink again.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: You've been to the other side.
s03e06	The Climb	BERIC: The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: You have someone He needs.
s03e06	The Climb	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS, WOODS
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY hands an arrowhead to GENDRY.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
s03e06	The Climb	GENDRY: Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: I'll get you the steel.
s03e06	The Climb	MAN: Come on.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE and her men pass nearby, pulling a wagon.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: I don't like that woman.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE, THOROS, and BERIC approach.
s03e06	The Climb	ANGUY: That's 'cause you're a girl.
s03e06	The Climb	GENDRY: (laughs)
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: What does that have to do with anything?
s03e06	The Climb	BERIC: Forgive me, lad.
s03e06	The Climb	Two of MELISANDRE's guards grab and bind Gendry.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: What are you doing? Let go of him.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA tries to intervene, but the guard pushes her away easily.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
s03e06	The Climb	BERIC: We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
s03e06	The Climb	A guard returns from the horses with two sacks of gold. He hands them to BERIC. MELISANDRE walks away.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
s03e06	The Climb	THOROS: We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.
s03e06	The Climb	GENDRY: You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA approaches MELISANDRE from behind and spins her around from the elbow.
s03e06	The Climb	ARYA: You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE grabs ARYA's chin.
s03e06	The Climb	MELISANDRE: I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again.
s03e06	The Climb	The wagon carrying GENDRY drives away.
s03e06	The Climb	EXT: THE WALL
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND, ORELL, YGRITTE, and JON climb the wall. Three more wildlings lag behind. The wind howls and the snow swirls. They use ropes, pitons, and axes. The climb is slow and arduous.  The height is dizzying.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?
s03e06	The Climb	JON smiles. Just above them, TORMUND's axe releases a cluster of ice from the wall.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND: Look out!
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL and YGRITTE dodge, but the falling ice hits JON in the face, and he loses his grip. His pitons gives way, and he slides helplessly down the wall until the slack of his rope is used up.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: You all right?
s03e06	The Climb	JON begins to climb again.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND: Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.
s03e06	The Climb	INT: DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY blows a horn, waking LORD THEON GREYJOY, who is bound to the X-shaped cross.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Sorry. Were you sleeping?
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Wa-
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY holds up the mug from the table next to him. He slowly pours out the water to the floor. He rises and walks to THEON>
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: (whimpering)
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Please.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Please is not a body part.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: I'll tell you everything, please.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY prods THEON.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY works at the leather straps on THEON's right hand.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: (groans)
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: If I win, you'll let me go?
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Please.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY brandishes a knife just before THEON's chin.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: The North.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Too vague.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Deepwood Motte.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Terrible guess.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY tortures THEON by stabbing his right pinky finger. THEON cries out.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Now, where?
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Last Hearth.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
s03e06	The Climb	This time, RAMSAY holds the knife in THEON's pinky finger for much longer.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Karhold!
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY stops.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: No. It was just a guess.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Torrhen Karstark.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY walks away.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: You swore to tell me if I-
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: You're right.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Yes. You win.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON is relieved. RAMSAY looks dejected, but then rises suddenly, full of energy.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY tortures THEON by twisting his knife in the tip of THEON's pinky finger.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: (screams louder than before)
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: I'm afraid I am.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY squeezes THEON's pinky finger.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: Everything I told you is a lie.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY continues to gouge THEON's pinky finger.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: (screams in desperation)
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it.
s03e06	The Climb	The torture continues.
s03e06	The Climb	THEON: Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY stops and stands before THEON. He smiles.
s03e06	The Climb	RAMSAY: I win.
s03e06	The Climb	INT: RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL
s03e06	The Climb	KING ROBB STARK, LADY CATELYN STARK, BRYNDEN "BLACKFISH" TULLY, LORD EDMURE TULLY, "BLACK WALDER" RIVERS, and LOTHAR FREY sit around a large table.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
s03e06	The Climb	BLACK WALDER: The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come.
s03e06	The Climb	LOTHAR: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
s03e06	The Climb	BLACK WALDER: As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: I don't think that's-
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
s03e06	The Climb	BLACK WALDER: And there's something else.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
s03e06	The Climb	BLACK WALDER: Not what, whom.
s03e06	The Climb	BLACK WALDER looks at EDMURE.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: What?
s03e06	The Climb	BRYDEN, ROBB, and LOTHAR also stare at EDMURE.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: (chuckles) No.
s03e06	The Climb	LOTHAR: Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: How old is she?
s03e06	The Climb	LOTHAR: Nineteen.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: Could I see her first?
s03e06	The Climb	BLACK WALDER: You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
s03e06	The Climb	BRYNDEN: Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
s03e06	The Climb	LOTHAR: Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
s03e06	The Climb	BLACK WALDER: And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
s03e06	The Climb	LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER exit.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE stands.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
s03e06	The Climb	BRYNDEN stands and walks to EDMURE.
s03e06	The Climb	BRYNDEN: Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
s03e06	The Climb	BRYNDEN: The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.
s03e06	The Climb	BRYNDEN sits.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.
s03e06	The Climb	CATELYN: You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
s03e06	The Climb	BRYNDEN: You recall that heroic engagement?
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: I had something less permanent in mind.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.
s03e06	The Climb	EDMURE: I'll marry her.
s03e06	The Climb	ROBB: You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.
s03e06	The Climb	INT: HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM
s03e06	The Climb	SER JAIME LANNISER struggles to feed himself one-handed. LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH sits next to him in a gown, and LORD ROOSE BOLTON sits across from them both.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
s03e06	The Climb	BRIENNE: Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.
s03e06	The Climb	BRIENNE stabs JAIME's steak so that he has leverage to cut it.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: I should send you back to Robb Stark.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: He'll make time for you.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME nods and reaches for a pitcher.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: Shall we drink on it?
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME begins to pour, but ROOSE BOLTON stops him.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: I don't partake.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME pours wine for BRIENNE and himself.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: Oh, she won't be going with you.
s03e06	The Climb	BRIENNE: I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: You are charged with abetting treason.
s03e06	The Climb	JAIME: I'm afraid I must insist.
s03e06	The Climb	ROOSE BOLTON: You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
s03e06	The Climb	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Impossible.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN pours some wine.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: Why?
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN hands a glass to LADY OLENNA TYRELL.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Old.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: Old?
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: Of course.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: And you never-
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: No.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Not once? Not in any way?
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: Never.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN stands, offended. He pours himself more wine.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA refuses TYWIN's offer for more wine.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: As an authority on myself, I must disagree.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN sits back down at his desk.
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: Oh
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN: I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?
s03e06	The Climb	TYWIN takes up a quill and prepares to write. OLENNA stands, and takes the quill from his hand.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA: It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
s03e06	The Climb	OLENNA snaps the quill.
s03e06	The Climb	EXT: THE WALL
s03e06	The Climb	The weather has worsened for the climbers. They shout to be heard over the howling winds. Each blow of the axe takes great strength to penetrate the ice. YGRITTE buries her axe in the wall, but a great crack opens across it. The ice wall cracks and pops to her right as the fissure travels across it. Suddenly, a huge swath of the wall gives way, taking three wildlings with it. They scream amidst the roar.
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL: No!
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL digs his axe deep into the wall. TORMUND does the same, bracing himself in a wide stance. The wall under YGRITTE and JON gives way and they falls amid an avalanche of ice and snow.
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: (screams)
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND prepares for the force of their fall on the rope that tethers them together.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND: (grunts)
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: (screams)
s03e06	The Climb	JON: (screams)
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL loses his grip on the wall. He dangles, trying to gain purchase with his climbing axe. TORMUND holds on as best he can.
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND: (grunts)
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL: We've gotta cut them loose!
s03e06	The Climb	TORMUND: No!
s03e06	The Climb	ORELL unsheathes his knife and begins to saw at the rope that connects him to YGRITTE and JON. They hang and dangle helplessly far from the wall, swinging back and forth. ORELL continues to cut through the rope. JON finally swings far enough to plant his axe in solid ice. At the same moment, ORELL cuts through the rope and YGRITTE plummets, limbs spinning. Her fall halts when the rope to JON goes taut.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: (grunts)
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: (screams)
s03e06	The Climb	JON: (grunts)
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE: (screams)
s03e06	The Climb	Jon tries to quiet the rope beneath him. YGRITTE hacks her axe into the wall. She climbs up to JON. He reaches out his hand.
s03e06	The Climb	JON: Take my hand!
s03e06	The Climb	They strain to connect, then clasp hands. JON pulls YGRITTE up to safety. They embrace, panting and exhausted. JON looks up to the sneering ORELL. They all begin to climb again.
s03e06	The Climb	EXT: KING'S LANDING, GARDENS
s03e06	The Climb	LADY SANSA STARK and SER LORAS TYRELL sit by a garden pool.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: That's a wonderful pin.
s03e06	The Climb	LORAS: Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA:  I'm very happy about
s03e06	The Climb	LORAS: Uh, yes. I-I am as well.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: I feel like I'm in a dream.
s03e06	The Climb	LORAS: Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
s03e06	The Climb	LORAS: It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.
s03e06	The Climb	LORAS stands and takes Sansa's hand to lead her away.
s03e06	The Climb	CUT TO: GARDENS OVERLOOK
s03e06	The Climb	LORD TYRION LANNISTER and QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER watch SANSA and LORAS from afar.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: We can have them both killed.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
s03e06	The Climb	They move inside and CERSEI sits.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: On a boat you built.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI doesn't answer.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: What do you want me to say?
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.
s03e06	The Climb	CERSEI: Who's going to tell her?
s03e06	The Climb	INT: SANSA'S CHAMBERS
s03e06	The Climb	SHAE helps SANSA with her dress.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: Do you think people will like it?
s03e06	The Climb	SHAE: I don't think they will even notice it.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.
s03e06	The Climb	SHAE: I'm sure he does.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: Will they let me invite my family?
s03e06	The Climb	SHAE: They haven't asked my opinion.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: But do you think they will?
s03e06	The Climb	SHAE: No.
s03e06	The Climb	The door opens.
s03e06	The Climb	MAID: Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION enters, catching SANSA partially dressed.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: I beg your pardon, my lady.
s03e06	The Climb	SHAE helps SANSA to recover her decency.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: Of course.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: Alone, if I may.
s03e06	The Climb	SHAE: Why do you need to speak to her alone?
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA: It's all right, really.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION closes the door.
s03e06	The Climb	TYRION: How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
s03e06	The Climb	INT: THRONE ROOM
s03e06	The Climb	VARYS and LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH look at the Iron Throne.
s03e06	The Climb	VARYS: A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.
s03e06	The Climb	LITTLEFINGER: There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
s03e06	The Climb	VARYS: Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.
s03e06	The Climb	LITTLEFINGER: Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.
s03e06	The Climb	VARYS: Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?
s03e06	The Climb	LITTLEFINGER: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.
s03e06	The Climb	VARYS: I did what I did for the good of the realm.
s03e06	The Climb	LITTLEFINGER: The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
s03e06	The Climb	VARYS: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
s03e06	The Climb	LITTLEFINGER: Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
s03e06	The Climb	CUT TO: JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS
s03e06	The Climb	Joffrey sits pensively with his crossbow. He stands and walks out, past the bloodied corpse of Ros. Her hands are tied above her head, and she is pierced by multiple crossbow bolts.
s03e06	The Climb	LITTLEFINGER: (voice over) Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
s03e06	The Climb	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING, GARDENS
s03e06	The Climb	SANSA and SHAE watch a boat sail away from King's Landing. SANSA weeps hopelessly. SHAE is sad but resolute.
s03e06	The Climb	LITTLEFINGER: (voice over) And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.
s03e06	The Climb	EXT: TOP OF THE WALL
s03e06	The Climb	YGRITTE pulls herself over the lip of the wall, exhausted. TORMUND and ORELL have already crested. TORMUND pulls up more supplies while ORELL looks through their provisions. YGRITTE doesn't have the strength to stand. JON pulls himself up as well, and collapses beside her. Above them, the sun breaks through the clouds. YGRITTE and JON prop themselves up and look across the Northlands. It is beautiful. JON stands and helps YGRITTE up. The sun lights up the wall. JON leads YGRITTE to look at the southern side of the wall. The land is green and lush. They embrace and kiss.
s03e06	The Climb	Unofficial script for Season 3 Episode 6.

s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EXT: THE NORTH
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	Just south of the Wall, the wildlings march across the green expanse of the North.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: How far are we?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: About a week, I think.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: You think? You don't know?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON SNOW and YGRITTE sit. She adjusts her boots.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON:  Most of the time, yes.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: How do the men holding the banners fight?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: So what good are they?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: They help the men march.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: How?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Well, it's- it's the rhythm.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE stands up and play-acts a silly march.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE leaves and ORELL catches up with JON.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL: She's right, you don't.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL: Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL: People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL continues on. JON follows behind.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	INT: RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	A thunderstorm roils outside of Riverrun. QUEEN TALISA STARK dries KING ROBB STARK's hair with a towel. LADY CATELYN STARK and LORD EDMURE TULLY sit at the map table. BRYNDEN "BLACKFISH" TULLY enters.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRYNDEN: That rain will cost us another day.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CATELYN: Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRYNDEN: Prickly?  That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CATELYN: Yes, and that is why-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRYNDEN: I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRYNDEN: (laughs)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CATELYN: Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EDMURE: He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CATELYN:  He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRYNDEN, CATELYN, and EDMURE leave. ROBB and TALISA kiss. CATELYN turns back to watch before she exits.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CUT TO: ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISSA and ROBB are wrapped around one another, panting, glowing with sweat, and kissing intimately. They smile. ROBB stands and dons a robe. TALISA watches him, amorously.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Attack. Attack.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB sits at the war table. TALISA pulls a writing board onto the bed.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: Who are you writing?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: My mother.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: Is that Valyrian?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Gaaa.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: Gaaa? (sighs) Say hello for me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Rytsas.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: 'Ritsas.'
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: That was close enough.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: Does she know her daughter's a queen?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Not yet.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: That will be a surprise, I expect.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Many surprises for her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: I will.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: What, now? Are you certain?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB stands.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA:  Are you angry with me?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB caresses her face. She grabs hold.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB:  Angry? You're my queen.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: Maybe one of each.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Don't get greedy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA kisses ROBB's hand.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TALISA: Can you leave the war for one night?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB: I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROBB and TALISA kiss and fall into bed.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CUT TO: RIVERRUN, ENCAMPMENT
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	Rain pours down as ROBB's men busy themselves with the chores of the night.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EXT: THE NORTH, DAY
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The wildlings rest in the woods from their long march.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TORMUND: Most men fuck like dogs.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TORMUND GIANTSBANE demonstrates for JON with pelvic thrusts into his pack. YGRITTE sits nearby, disapproving.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TORMUND: No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. (laughs) Come on! Hey, come on.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TORMUND gives JON a playful jab and walks off. JON gets up and follows, along with YGRITTE and ORELL.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CUT TO: THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The wildings march.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL: You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE:  No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL: I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: What, you're jealous?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL:  Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL stops her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL: You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: (nods)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL:  'Cause he's pretty?  Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE tries to walk, but ORELL stops her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Don't touch me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL: You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ORELL walks away and YGRITTE takes measure of him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EXT: KING'S LANDING, GARDENS
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: Come on. Come walk with me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LADY MARGAERY TYRELL and LADY SANSA STARK stand and walk.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY picks a rose.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY hands the rose to SANSA.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: No.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	They walk.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: Has he been kind to you?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: He's tried.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: You don't want him, though.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: He's a Lannister.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA:  I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA:  My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: If it's the pain you're worried about-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: And that's a good thing?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY:  It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SANSA: How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY takes SANSA's arm.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MARGAERY: Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LORD TYRION LANNISTER and SER BRONN OF THE BLACKWATER sit, drinking wine.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: She's a child.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: She's a foot taller than you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: A tall child.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: What's the youngest you've ever had?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: Not that young.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: How much older?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: Older.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: Shae isn't going to like it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: I should never have told you about that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN pours more wine for them both.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. (chuckles) You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN: You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRONN stands and grabs another pitcher of wine.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	INT: KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN enters the vast throne room. KING JOFFREY BARATHEON sits on the Iron Throne.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: Your Grace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: Grandfather.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: You wanted to speak to me?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: Of course.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: I have, yes.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: May I ask why?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN approaches and stands over JOFFREY.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN:  We could arrange to have you carried.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: Where did you hear about this?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: Is it true?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: Apparently so.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: But I haven't been counseled.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: You are being counseled at this very moment.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOFFREY: I should be consulted about such things.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN: From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYWIN bows and walks away. JOFFREY ponders.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EXT: ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS TARGARYEN, SER JORAH MORMONT, SER BARRISTAN SELMY, and GREY WORM walk across the rocky and arid landscape. An impressive city lies in the distance among the mountains.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JORAH: Yunkai. The Yellow City.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BARRISTAN: The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JORAH: On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JORAH: We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JORAH: Two hundred thousand if not more.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GREY WORM nods, then turns and exits.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CUT TO: ROAD TO YUNKAI
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The Unsullied come to attention. Led by a drummer and flanked by guards, a brightly colored palaquin carrying RADZAL MO ERAZ passes through. He surveys the Unsullied who speckle the rough landscape. The chains of the slaves who bear his load rattle as they walk. More slaves bear  ornate chests as they walk. They reach the camp where DAENERYS waits to receive them, with BARRISTAN, JORAH, and her dragons at her side. The slaves lower the palaquin. RADZAL MO ERAZ steps out and is greeted by MISSANDEI.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MISSANDEI: Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The dragons screech in warning as RAZDAL MO ERAZ approaches nervously.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MISSANDEI: Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: You may approach. Sit.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	A Dothraki woman presents a chair for RADZAL MO ERAZ, and he sits.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MISSANDEI: Will the noble lord take refreshment?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: (nods)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MISSANDEI pours him some wine. RADZAL MO ERAZ drinks, never taking his eyes from DAENERYS.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS tosses a raw steak in the air. The three dragons launch after it, screeching as they jockey and circle in flight.  RADZAL MO ERAZ recoils in trepidation.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	He claps twice to signal his slaves. They bring forth the two chests.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The slaves place the chests before DAENERYS and open their lids. The chests are filled with gold ingots. The slaves retreat and bow deeply before her in reverence.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: My ship?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: And what do you ask in return?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ:  All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: My life?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ stands quickly. DROGON screeches angrily from his perch in warning.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: You swore me safe conduct.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: Take the gold.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The slaves rise and cautiously approach the open chests. The dragons refuse their approach with aggressive screeching. The slaves retreat in fear.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ: (speaks Valerian)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RADZAL MO ERAZ turns and stomps off.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BARRISTAN: The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JORAH: I don't know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	DAENERYS: Find out.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JORAH nods and exits. DROGON hops next to DAENERYS and she strokes the dragon. He purrs.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE fondles a woven gold necklace in a beautiful inlaid wooden box.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: Chains?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: Golden chains.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: You could buy a ship with these.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: Do I need a ship?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: What?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: Am I going somewhere?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: Of course you're not going anywhere.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: So, am I invited to your wedding?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION:  I don't have a choice. My father-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: And I'm Shae the funny whore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: I swear to you it will not be like that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: No? What will it be like?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION moves closer to SHAE and takes her hand.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION:  Listen. Listen to me, my lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: I'm not your lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	TYRION: You are. You'll always be my lady.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE: I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	SHAE pushes away TYRION's hand and exits.

s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	A two masted ship sails amongst wreckage of sunken ships. MELISANDRE and GENDRY walk its deck.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: What happened?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: Wildfire. I should have been here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: Do you miss it?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: King's Landing?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: Your father's house.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: Never had a father. Never wanted one.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: I was born in Flea Bottom.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: Your blood is noble.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: There. Your father's house.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	GENDRY: I'm just a bastard.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MELISANDRE: The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.

s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: Come sit by the fire, child.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA doesn't answer. She sits curled on a rock.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THOROS: Not talking, eh? That's a first.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: I don't talk to traitors.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: I didn't like giving up the boy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: He's not my one true god.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: No? Who's yours?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: Death.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	Men chatter and cough as they enter the cavern, led by ANGUY.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ANGUY: Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: How many?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ANGUY: No more than twenty.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: How far?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ANGUY: Less than a day's ride south.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: (nods)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THOROS: What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MEN: Yeah!
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THOROS: It will still be west of here two days from now.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: You swore.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: Why? So you can steal their gold?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: I swear to you, this isn't-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA: I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: One day you'll understand, but now-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA runs off.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BERIC: Anguy, bring her back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MAN: Come back, girl!
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS, WOODS, NIGHT
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ARYA runs through the woods. She crosses a stream and keeps running. She crouches in the woods, looking back at the Brotherhood's torches. She takes flight again and is grabbed by THE HOUND.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THE HOUND: Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	He carries her off into the darkness.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	INT: HARRENHALL, NIGHT
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH sits in a shaft of moonlight. The door opens, and SER JAIME LANNISTER enters.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: I thought you were gone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Tomorrow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME:  Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: With Locke?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: I owe you a debt.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: (nods) I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.

s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The courtyard is busy as the men ready to depart. JAIME struggles to saddle his horse one handed.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: Here. Let me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN buckles the saddle for JAIME.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: It will take time.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: (nods)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN exits and ROOSE BOLTON approaches.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROOSE BOLTON: Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME mounts his horse.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	ROOSE BOLTON: You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: (nods) Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME and QYBURN ride away. They pass LOCKE.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	INT: DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA and VIOLET remove LORD THEON GREYJOY's restraints and help him down from the cross.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: Shh.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: (groans)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA removes THEON's hood. VIOLET holds a cup of water to his lips, and helps him drink. He grabs the cup desperately and spills its contents in his mouth.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Gentle, my lord. Gentle.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET strokes and soothes THEON's forehead. MYRANDA kneels next to him and applies a salve to his forehead. THEON squirms.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: (coughs)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Shh, shh, shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only (giggles) she had other urges.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: So did the septons, only they lied about it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET and MYRANDA fondle THEON's bare chest. THEON is suspicious.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: Where is he?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Who, my lord?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET and MYRANDA continue to caress THEON. VIOLET slides her hands under THEON's trousers. He grabs her hand to stop her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: Please.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Don't you want us to see it?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: He sent you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: Who sent us?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: We heard so much about it. (giggles)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: Please.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Oh! There it is.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	She is disapointed that THEON is flaccid.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: Help me. If he comes back-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: We need to make him feel better.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: And how can we make him feel better?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: I have an idea.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET stands and comes to MYRANDA. She pulls the lacing of MYRANDA's dress until it peels away. She helps the dress to the ground. THEON is excited but disbelieving.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA straddles THEON and undulates on top of him. VIOLET kisses his forhead.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: As good as they say?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: Mmm.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA's breath quickens as she rubs across the length of him. THEON holds onto her, joining into her rhythm.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: And why should you get all the fun?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET shrugs off her own gown. THEON is entranced. MYRANDA grabs his face and pulls his attention back to her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA:  What? You like her better?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA kisses THEON. VIOLET kneels beside them and grabs hold of THEON.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	VIOLET: Plenty there for both of us.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MYRANDA: I was here first.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: (moaning)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY's horn blares from across the room, startling THEON. VIOLET and MYRANDA retreat and RAMSAY walks out of the shadows.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: (cries)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY: But I was getting jealous.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY stands in front of the naked VIOLET and MYRANDA, who sway innocently behind him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY: Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON leaps up in a clumsy attempt to flee. RAMSAY backhands him and THEON falls to the ground, helpless and weak. RAMSAY tosses away the horn and wraps his arms around the naked women as they flank him.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY: Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY cups their naked asses. He steps forward and draws a knife. THEON struggles to crawl away, but his arms and legs are useless from his days bound to the cross.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY: Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY whistles and two guards come forth.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	RAMSAY: This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The guards hold THEON down while RAMSAY sets to him with the knife.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	THEON: No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!

s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: It's too far away.

s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The wildling party is on the march. Two of them carry the deer that YGRITTE killed. In the near distance, YGRITTE spies a decrepit windmill.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Is that a palace?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: It's a windmill.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Just the men who used to live here.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Winterfell has towers three times that size.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: 'I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.'
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: What's swooning?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Fainting.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: What's fainting?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: When a girl sees blood and collapses.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Well not all girls are like you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? (gasps) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	She falls backwards into his arms, smiling.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	She punches him playfully.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Would you?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	He grabs her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: So I could tear it off you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: You know nothing-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: And how do you know that?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: Mance is different.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: You don't know that.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: All of us.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE kissed JON, hungrily.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	YGRITTE: You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JON: Yes, first we'll live.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	They kiss again.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EXT: THE NORTH, CAMP
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MEERA REED walks into camp, carrying the rabbit she has caught. OSHA and HODOR sets up the tent while RICKON STARK sleeps next to them. LORD BRAN STARK and JOJEN REED sit talking nearby.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	HODOR:  Hodor.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOJEN: That's where we are.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA walks over to confront JOJEN.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: What are you telling him?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRAN: It's all right, Osha.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day?  Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MEERA: Leave him alone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: He can speak for himself.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOJEN: I don't fill his head with anything.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: So what do you talk about?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOJEN:  What's happening to him and what that means.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: Go on, then. Tell us what it means.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOJEN: It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA starts to walk away.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOJEN: We're not going to Castle Black.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: What did you say?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JOJEN:  I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA kneels next to BRAN.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRAN: The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRAN: What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRAN: You don't understand. You don't know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA stands, agitated.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA sits.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA: I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	OSHA rises and walks off.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EXT: RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN tends to the stump of JAIME's right arm. His wrist is sewn roughly.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: How is the pain, my lord?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: Well, we've stymied the corruption.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: All the good it's done me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN places a salve onto JAIME's healing wound.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: Faint praise, my lord.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN dresses JAIME's wound once more.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: No, my lord. That's not my weakness.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: What is?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: You performed experiments on living men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: On dying men.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: With their permission?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: How many men have you killed, my lord?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: I don't know.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: Fifty? A hundred?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: (shakes his head)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: Countless.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Countless has a nice ring to it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: And how many lives have you saved?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: A fair offer.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME stands. QYBURN packs up his medicines.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Why not?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: (sighs)
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: He feels he's being cheated.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: They'd be fools to kill her.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	QYBURN: These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME ponders, and then approaches "STEELSHANKS" WALTON, who drinks from a wine skin nearby
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: We have to return to Harrenhal.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON: Why?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME:  I've left something behind.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON: Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: And what are those orders?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON:  To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: You think you'll get a reward.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON stands.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON: I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON: I had nothing-
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	EXT: THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME and the men ride into the old courtyard. The castle is a ruin around them.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Whoa.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON: Eyes open, lads.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME searches with eyes and ears.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Be quiet.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME hears singing in the distance. He dismounts and runs towards the sounds of the crowd. "STEELSHANKS"WALTON and his men follow.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MEN: (singing) The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME climbs some wooden steps to join the crowd on a viewing platform. The crowd yells and cheers. In a wooden arena, BRIENNE stands desperate and defensive, brandishing a wooden sword. Her dress is torn and covered in mud. Blood oozes from gashes on her neck and shoulder. An enormous brown bear lumbers and stalks her. The bear roars.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	MAN: Don't spare her. Don't spare her!
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: A wooden sword?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE notices that JAIME is in the crowd.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: I thought you'd gone.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME pushes his way towards LOCKE.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: You gave her a wooden sword.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: We've only got one bear.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE shoves JAIME.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The bear rears up before BRIENNE. She tries to hold him off with her wooden sword, but the bear's reach is too long. He takes a powerful swipe and disarms her. BRIENNE staggers backwards. The bear pounces and knocks her to the ground.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: Ah!
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME jumps into the wooden arena, arms flailing. He lands behind her, and startles the bear.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Get behind me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: I will not.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	He helps BRIENNE up as the bear regroups. JAIME puts himself in front of BRIENNE. The bear regroups, swipes the ground, and advances on them. Suddenly, a crossbow bolt pierces the bear's side. He turns his head towards the pain in its shoulder.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	"STEELSHANKS" WALTON: Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	The bear shakes its head back and forth, confused by the pain. JAIME runs to the arena wall and crouches by the wall.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Pull her up.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE clambers onto JAIME's back. A man in the crowd grabs her outstretched hand. Two men pull her to safety. The bear roars.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: Hold my legs.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE lies over the side of the platform and reaches down. The bear charges at JAIME. "STEELSHANKS" WALTON fires a bolt that lands wide. JAIME jumps and grabs hold of a beam that juts out of the arena wall and clambers just out of reach of the bear. The bear roars. BRIENNE continues to reach down to JAIME as he tries clumsily to scale the wall. He swings his legs up, gains some leverage and hooks his handless forearm around the beam. He then lurches into BRIENNE's reach.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE: Pull him up!
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	BRIENNE and the men pull JAIME up to safety. The bear pounds the wall.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: The bitch stays.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME stands up to confront LOCKE.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	LOCKE: She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME and LOCKE stand off. LOCKE's men prepare for a fight, but LOCKE relents.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME: Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.
s03e07	The Bear and the Maiden Fair	JAIME and BRIENNE push their way through the crowd and walk off. "STEELSHANKS" WALTON follows. The bear roars.

s03e08	Second Sons	EXT: RIVERLANDS, WOODS, MORNING
s03e08	Second Sons	LADY ARYA STARK lies on the ground, eyes open. She gets up quietly, picks up a large rock and creeps step by step towards THE Hound, who sleeps peacefully. She raises it over her head to strike. Without moving, he speaks. She freezes.
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND: I'll give you one try, girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	He turns to look at her.
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND: Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard.
s03e08	Second Sons	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND rides his horse, with ARYA sitting side saddle in front of him. He takes a bite of an apple and then offers to share with ARYA. She looks, but ignores it, so THE HOUND takes another bite.
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND: Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you.
s03e08	Second Sons	ARYA: There's no one worse than you.
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND: Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them.
s03e08	Second Sons	ARYA: You're lying.
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND: Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open.
s03e08	Second Sons	They reach a vista with an expansive river.
s03e08	Second Sons	ARYA: Is that the Blackwater?
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND: The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm taking you?
s03e08	Second Sons	ARYA: Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND: Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
s03e08	Second Sons	ARYA: But why?
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND:  Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
s03e08	Second Sons	ARYA: Why would they be at the Twins?
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND:  Those outlaws you love so much never told you?  The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
s03e08	Second Sons	THE HOUND goads his mount, and they continue to ride.
s03e08	Second Sons	EXT: ESSOS
s03e08	Second Sons	Soldiers gallop through the barren landscape outside Yunkai. DAENERYS TARGARYEN, SER JORAH MORMONT, and SER BARRISTAN SELMY watch them from a distance, hidden in a crag. They are wrapped in drab fabrics to manage the heat of the desert.
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN: Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
s03e08	Second Sons	JORAH: They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: You know these men?
s03e08	Second Sons	JORAH: Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, "The Titan's Bastard."
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Is he more titan or bastard?
s03e08	Second Sons	JORAH: He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: How many?
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN: Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Enough to make a difference?
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN: (nods)
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
s03e08	Second Sons	JORAH: I imagine you're right.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
s03e08	Second Sons	JORAH: He may not agree to meet.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	EXT: An open tent outside of Yunkai
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN stands next to MERO, PRENDAHL, and DAARIO NAHARIS. DAENERYS sits in front of them with MISSANDEI, while GREY WORM stand nearby.
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN: Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: Daario Naharis
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO steps forward.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: You are the Mother of Dragons?  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
s03e08	Second Sons	JORAH: Mind your tongue.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO sits on the couch next to DAENERYS. DAARIO and PRENDAHL sit nearby.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO waggles his tongue suggestively at DAENERYS. She does not react.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: (laughs) You, slave girl, bring wine.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: We have no slaves here.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN: Under two thousand, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: We have more, don't we?
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN: Ten thousand Unsullied.
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI serves wine to MERO, He toasts DAENERYS and drinks. MISSANDEI serves DAARIO and PRENDAHL.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: You're very young to be a captain.
s03e08	Second Sons	PRENDAHL: He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
s03e08	Second Sons	JORAH: The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Or you could fight for me.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO motions for more wine. MISSANDEI obliges.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: I would pay you as much and more.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO sniffs MISSNDEI, who jumps back, startled.
s03e08	Second Sons	PRENDAHL: Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
s03e08	Second Sons	GREY WORM: (speaks Valyrian) My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) These men are our guests. (Speaks common.) You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: A barrel, then.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO stands. DAARIO and PRENDAHL follow suit. They start to leave.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO and DAENERYS exchange a glance. MERO gives a lecherous look to MISSANDEI as he passes.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: I'll come looking for you when this is over.
s03e08	Second Sons	Mero slaps Missandei's rump as he leaves.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.
s03e08	Second Sons	BARRISTAN: Gladly, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	EXT: DRAGONSTONE, SHORELINE
s03e08	Second Sons	Soldiers help MELISANDRE and GENDRY to exit their ship's boat. GENDRY looks up at the castle. MELISANDRE turns and GENDRY follows.
s03e08	Second Sons	INT: DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM
s03e08	Second Sons	KING STANNIS BARATHEON stands among his maps. MELISANDRE, GENDRY, and their accompanying soldiers enter. STANNIS walks over to GENDRY and grabs him by the chin to get. a better look at his face. GENDRY stares back.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: Half Robert, half lowborn.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY exits with the soldiers.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: What do you mean to do with him?
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: You know what I mean to do with him.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: No.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: You've slaughtered many lambs?
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: And none have seen the blade.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISSANDRE exits.
s03e08	Second Sons	CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON
s03e08	Second Sons	SER DAVOS SEAWORTH sits, trying to sound out words by candlelight.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: 'And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS smiles, pleased with himself. STANNIS enters and DAVOS rises to meet him. They talk across the bars that imprison DAVOS.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: They feeding you enough?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: You don't belong in a place like this.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: Yeah.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: (nods)
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: Melisandre's returned.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: I didn't know she'd been gone.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Why?
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: She says there's power in king's blood.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: She's going to kill him.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: Sacrifice him.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Because he has your blood in his veins.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: So did Renly.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?  Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: You have little regard for your own life.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAVOS: Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
s03e08	Second Sons	EXT: OUTSIDE YUNKAI
s03e08	Second Sons	The camp of the Second Sons bustles with the work of the day. MERO, DAARIO, and PRENDAHL sit in an open tent. MERO fondles the bare-chested WHORE who sits on his lap.
s03e08	Second Sons	PRENDAHL: Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: You talk too much.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: I fight for beauty.
s03e08	Second Sons	PRENDAHL: For beauty?
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: We fight for gold.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: You'll die young.
s03e08	Second Sons	PRENDAHL: What do we do about the dragon girl?  We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
s03e08	Second Sons	PRENDAHL: She's well guarded.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
s03e08	Second Sons	PRENDAHL: Which one of us?
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Close your eyes, love.
s03e08	Second Sons	The WHORE stands, and MERO picks up a coin purse. He pours out three coins into his hand.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO: Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking.
s03e08	Second Sons	MERO hands the coins to the WHORE, spins her around and plants a kiss and a slap on her ass.  She blindly feels her way forward to PRENDAHL, who takes a coin. She then fumbles back to MERO, and he takes a coin. She then orients her way to DAARIO.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
s03e08	Second Sons	She falls into his lap, laughing.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: You have something for me?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO takes the final coin from the WHORE's hand and holds it up. It is the Braavosi coin.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: Valar morghulis.
s03e08	Second Sons	INT: KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS
s03e08	Second Sons	SHAE and two servants help LADY SANSA STARK with the final touches of her make-up. SHAE answers a knock at the door. She is displeased to see LORD TYRION LANNISTER. The two servants leave, and SHAE ignores TYRION as he and PODRICK PAYNE enter.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Lady Sansa.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: You look very handsome, my lord.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?
s03e08	Second Sons	SHAE and PODRICK exit. TYRION shuts the door.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: I doubt that very much, my lord.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION takes SANSA's hand, tenderly.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: When I have to.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Well, today you have to.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA smiles. TYRION leads her forward.
s03e08	Second Sons	INT: KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR
s03e08	Second Sons	QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER and LADY MARGAERY TYRELL look on as the sept is prepared for the wedding.
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY: You look radiant, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: Radiant? Why radiant?
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY: It's the word that came to mind.
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY takes CERSEI's arm in hers.
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY: We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice.
s03e08	Second Sons	They begin to descend into the sept.
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY: A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?
s03e08	Second Sons	They pass SER LORAS TYRELL, and stop a bit further along.
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY: Of course. They play it so often here at court.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY:  Not as well as you, I'm sure.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY: (nods)
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?
s03e08	Second Sons	MARGAERY: Gone.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.
s03e08	Second Sons	They continue down the great stairs to the main floor.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'
s03e08	Second Sons	They pause. CERSEI looks MARGAERY in the eye and frees her arm.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI exits.
s03e08	Second Sons	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE SEPT
s03e08	Second Sons	The great doors open to the Sept of Baelor. SANSA walks through them, alone.
s03e08	Second Sons	CUT TO: INSIDE THE SEPT
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION stands on the stage, watching SANSA enter at the other side of the sept. The crowd quiets. SANSA pauses at the top of the steps. KING JOFFREY BARATHEON approaches, smirking.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: What are you doing?
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA takes JOFFREY's arm. The doors closes. They descend the stairs and walk through the crowd, SANSA and JOFFREY apprach TYRION, passing SER BRONN OF THE BLACKWATER, MARGAERY, LADY OLENNA TYRELL, LORAS, CERSEI, LORD TYWIN LANNISTER, and GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE, and reach TYRION and the HIGH SEPTON. JOFFREY reaches down and takes TYRION's step stool before noisily joining CERSEI and TYWIN. TYRION fumes.
s03e08	Second Sons	HIGH SEPTON: You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA turns her back to TYRION. He attempts to cloak SANSA, but he is too short. JOFFREY snickers and some in the crowd join in. TYWIN quiets their rudeness with a look.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Could you-
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA kneels for TYRION. He places the cloak on her shoulders, and she accepts it. She rises.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Thank you.
s03e08	Second Sons	HIGH SEPTON: Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.
s03e08	Second Sons	INT: DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY paces. The door opens noisily and MELISANDRE enters, holding an ornate box.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Have you ever seen one like it?
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE lights a stick and uses it to ignite some more candles.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE hands a chalice of wine to GENDRY.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Here, taste this.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY stands motionless, refusing the wine.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: You think I'm trying to poison you?
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE takes a deep drink. GENDRY takes the wine from MELISANDRE and drinks thirstily.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: That's good.
s03e08	Second Sons	He nearly finishes it in two drinks.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: That's really good.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Where do you think it's from?
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: I couldn't even guess.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE strokes GENDRY's cheek.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: There are no mistakes. Not for us.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE takes a sip of wine. As she speaks, she caresses GENDRY and begins to undress him.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE removes GENDRY's shirt.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE fondles GENDRY's midriff.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE drops her dress to the floor and caresses the back of GENDRY's head.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE leads GENDRY to the side of the bed. She kisses him, and gently pushes him back onto the bed. She undoes his pants and straddles him.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
s03e08	Second Sons	She helps him inside of her, and they both undulate and moan with pleasure. GENDRY fondles her breasts, and MELISANDRE gently leads his hands to the headboard of the grand bed. She quickly binds them with a single pull on a leather strap.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: What are you doing?
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE gives him a peck.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: You have to trust me.
s03e08	Second Sons	She searches down GENDRY's body and he gives himself over to her, eyes closed. She binds GENDRY's booted feet to the other end of the bed. He opens his eyes, watching and panting. MELISANDRE opens the ornate box at the side of the bed, pulls out a leech, and places it on GENDRY's chest. He begins to panic.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: What-?  Get it away. Get it off me.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE places more leeches on GENDRY's chest.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: Why are you doing this?
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE places a leech on GENDRY's groin. The chamber door opens. STANNIS and DAVOS enter.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE: You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE walks to her dress and slips it back on. STANNIS  approaches them.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE returns to GENDRY and removes the leeches with her forceps.
s03e08	Second Sons	GENDRY: (cries out)
s03e08	Second Sons	MELISANDRE hands leeches to STANNIS, next to the brazier that she lit earlier. STANNIS takes out the leaches one by one, tossing them into the flames, which spark with each one.
s03e08	Second Sons	STANNIS: The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
s03e08	Second Sons	INT: KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY and CERSEI sit amidst the festivities drinking wine and chatting. TYWIN sits to their left, stoic. At the head table, TYRION carefully and drunkenly fills his wine glass to the brim. He smacks his lips and looks over to SANSA, who is disgusted with him. The Tyrells sit across the hall from the Lannisters. OLENNA speaks with amusement to LORAS and MARGAERY.
s03e08	Second Sons	OLENNA: So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew?  Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute.
s03e08	Second Sons	LORAS leaves in a huff. At the head table, TYRION checks his teeth in a golden plate and tosses it aside. TYWIN looks on with disdain as TYRION spills his wine. He starts to clean himself with the table cloth. The embarrasment brings SANSA out of her stiff discomfort.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: (snorts)
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: Will you pardon me, my lord?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA stands and exits. JOFFREY gets up to intercept her, but CERSEI steadies him with a touch to the hand.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: I've got a lifetime for that.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY shakes off her hand and leaves. CERSEI sighs and gets up to follow. Her handmaiden starts to trail her.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: Stay.
s03e08	Second Sons	Back at the head table, TYRION notices SANSA talking to VARYS, with SHAE standing by them. TYWIN appears beside him, startling TYRION.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN: You seem rather drunk.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN: This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: And?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN: If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN: More than once.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN takes away TYRION's wine and slams it on the table. TYRION spits and fumes.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN: You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN returns to his own seat. LORAS stands above in the balustrade, surveying the scene from afar. TYRION salutes LORAS with his cup. LORAS looks away uncomfortably, and notices CERSEI on the balustrade, looking out at the sea. He approaches her.
s03e08	Second Sons	LORAS: Well, my father once told me-
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI: Nobody cares what your father once told you.
s03e08	Second Sons	CERSEI exits.
s03e08	Second Sons	CUT TO: THE WEDDING RECEPTION
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA walks through the revelry with SHAE. After opening a curtain for SANSA, SHAE quickly departs as JOFFREY intercepts SANSA.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: Congratulations, my lady.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: Thank you, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?  What a glorious day.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: Yes, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA does not reply.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY smirks cruelly as he turns back to the main hall and claps his hands for attention.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: Time for the bedding ceremony.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: There will be no bedding ceremony.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY takes SANSA's hand and leads her to the central banquet floor.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: There will be no bedding ceremony.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: There will be if I command it.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION stabs his knife resoundingly into the table in front of him. JOFFREY is shocked.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN rises from his seat.
s03e08	Second Sons	JOFFREY: What did you say? What did you say?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN: I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION's hand shakes with rage as he grips the knife with all his strength. Suddenly, he regains his drunken composure. He releases the knife and laughs obsequiously.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYWIN: Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION staggers from the head table, and tumbles into another as he walks.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION entreats SANSA to come with him. She follows, embarrassed and small.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.
s03e08	Second Sons	CUT TO: TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION opens the door for SANSA. She enters nervously. TYRION closes the door and staggers directly to the wine, and pours himself a glass.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: Is that wise, my lord?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: Is that wise, Tyrion?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Nothing was ever wiser.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION sits on the side of the bed.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Astoundingly long.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: What?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: Fourteen.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA takes a breath. She pours herself some wine and drinks it. TYRION offers a drunken toast of solidarity. SANSA moves quietly and obediently to the bed and begins undressing her many layers while TYRION watches.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: But your father-
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.
s03e08	Second Sons	SANSA: What if I never want you to?
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION toasts SANSA.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: And so my watch begins.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION drinks. He turns, sets down his glass, and immediately passes out . SANSA is speechless.
s03e08	Second Sons	EXT: ENCAMPMENT OUTSIDE YUNKAI, NIGHT
s03e08	Second Sons	The encampment bustles in spite of the late hour, with the Unsullied patrolling the paths between the tents. One Unsullied trots through camp alone.
s03e08	Second Sons	INT: DAENERYS'S TENT
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI bathes DAENERYS in a tub by candlelight.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Ninteen
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: Yes, Your Grace.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: (in Dothraki) Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: Athjahakar.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Athjahaka.
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: Ath-ja-hakar.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Athjahakar.
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: (nods)
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry.
s03e08	Second Sons	MISSANDEI: (gasps)
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS turns to see MISSANDEI held captive, her mouth covered and a knife at her throat. Her assailant, DAARIO, wears the uniform of the Unsullied.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: No screaming or she dies.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO leads MISSANDEI further into the tent. DAENERYS watches nervously, feeling vulnerable in her bath. DAARIO removes the knife from her throat, and lifts of the Unsullied helmet. His eyes smile at DAENERYS. She is confused and angry.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: What do you want?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO places the tip of his blade back onto MISSANDEI's throat.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: You.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Let her go.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: Don't scream, lovely girl.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO releases MISSANDEI with a grand gesture. She scampers next to DAENERYS.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: You were sent here to kill me?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: (nods and chuckles)
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: So why haven't you?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: I don't want to.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: What do your captains have to say about that?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: You should ask them.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO removes his satchel and dumps its contents on the floor. The heads of MERO and PRENDAHL thud as they hit the floor.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Why?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: We had philosophical differences.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Over what?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: You're a strange man.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: And this is supposed to impress me?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: Yes.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS rises from her bath and steps to the floor. She stands naked before DAARIO, matching his confidence with her resolve. MISSANDEI steps behind her and slips her into a robe.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Will you fight for me?
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: (nods)
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS walks to him.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAENERYS: Swear to me.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO unsheathes his sword and kneels, placing it across his knees.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO: The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
s03e08	Second Sons	DAARIO bows his head.
s03e08	Second Sons	INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, MORNING
s03e08	Second Sons	The door to TYRION's chamber opens. SANSA sleeps alone in TYRION's bed. TYRION lies on the settee that he passed out on the night before.  SHAE walks in without looking at TYRION and slam the breakfast tray the she holds onto the table. SANSA rises from the bed while TYRION struggles to even prop himself up.
s03e08	Second Sons	TYRION: You really ought to knock.
s03e08	Second Sons	SHAE: I brought your breakfast.
s03e08	Second Sons	Irritated, SHAE moves quickly through the room. She snatches SANSA's dress from under TYRION's head. His head thumps into the chair's arm. SHAE helps SANSA to dress while TYRION struggles with his hang over. SHAE begins to strip the bed, and notices that the sheets are stain-free. She softens and exchanges a sympathetic and understanding look with TYRION. She exits with the sheets.
s03e08	Second Sons	EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL, DUSK
s03e08	Second Sons	SAMWELL TARLY, GILLY, and her BABY walk across the snowy landscape, exhausted. The wind churns. GILLY stops by a tree while SAM examines a broken farmhouse. A crow lands in the godswood tree above them.
s03e08	Second Sons	BABY: (fusses)
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
s03e08	Second Sons	BABY: (fusses)
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY hands the BABY to SAM. SAM smiles at the child while  GILLY collects firewood. A second crow joins the first in the tree. SAM pauses, surprised at the coincidence.
s03e08	Second Sons	CUT TO: THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT
s03e08	Second Sons	The wind howls and whistles in the night. Inside the broken farmhouse, SAM tries to strike a fire with his flint stones.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: How hard can it be to build a fire?
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM blinks rapidly, then sits next to GILLY. She spreads the furs over them both and looks at him.
s03e08	Second Sons	BABY: (fusses)
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: He winked at me before.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: I doubt it.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: I saw him wink at me.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: He blinked.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: A what?
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Well, I mean, there's no real difference.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: A wink is on purpose.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: What? No. This is just the way I talk.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: I'll build that fire.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY sets down the BABY and stacks the wood. She tries to strike the flint.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Don't you think he should have a name?
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: I don't know many boys' names.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Craster.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM is taken aback. While he thinks of how to respond, the fire comes alive.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Mormont.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY feeds the fire.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Why is it a last name?
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: His name is Samwell Tarly, too?
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: No, Randyll Tarly.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Randyll is a handsome name.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Please don't name him Randyll.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Is your father cruel like mine?
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Different manner of cruel.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY blows on the fire. Crows caw outside the broken barn.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Not Randyll, then.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY sits back down next to SAM. The sounds of crows escalate into a chorus of relentless cawing. SAM and GILLY listen with fear. SAM nods at her with a slight smile, and rises.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: Don't. Don't go out there.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM takes a burning torch from the fire.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: I'll be back. I just want to look.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM reaches the side of the barn and looks out. He grabs his sword as he exits. The godswood tree is swarmed by crows. They cry out in a cacophany. GILLY joins SAM outside, clutching her BABY. Every branch of the godswood is covered by crows. There must be hundreds.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
s03e08	Second Sons	Suddenly the crows fall silent. A growl comes out of the darkness beyond them. SAM looks into the woods, and drops his torch.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: It's come for the baby.
s03e08	Second Sons	A lone figure walks towards them from the woods. SAM readies his sword, two handed. The figure comes closer. It is a White Walker, approaching calmly.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: Stay back!
s03e08	Second Sons	The White Walker continues to approach. SAM extends his sword in front of him, an unconvincing threat. The White Walker is nearly upon SAM.
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM: You stay back!
s03e08	Second Sons	The White Walker grabs SAM's sword. It sounds a resonant ring and suddenly shatters in his grip. He levels SAM with an uppercut that sends him sprawling to the ground. He turns his attention to GILLY and her BABY.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY:  No, you can't have him! No!
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM draws the dragonglass knife from his furs.
s03e08	Second Sons	GILLY: No!
s03e08	Second Sons	SAM runs to intercept the White Walker. He lunged and plants the dragonglass knife in the shoulder blade of the White Walker. The ghoul screeches and turns to attack SAM. But the White Walker seizes up, howls, and falls to his knees, his flesh hardening and cracking like ice. Suddenly, he shatters into tiny shards, practically vanishing into crystal dust. SAM and GILLY are stupefied. The crows begin to sound again. SAM grabs GILLY. They run away from the barn and into the woods. The crows take to flight, swarming them and cawing in a thunderous clamor.

s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Opening Credits]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[First scene shows the location of Casterly Rock (ancestral seat of House Lannister) on a giant map of Westeros. There are several game pieces representing different House sigils located on different parts of the map. ROBB STARK and CATELYN STARK are at a campsite, within a tent lit up by candles]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Are you sure about this?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: No.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: It's dangerous.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB nods in agreement]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.  Take his home, take his gold, take his power.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Why are you telling me?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB pauses then walks around CATELYN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB pours himself something to drink]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Now Winterfell is burned to the ground.  The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB pauses]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: So, Casterly Rock?  I'm asking your advice.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[CATELYN pauses, staring at ROBB.  She then looks at the map]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: We have enough men?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB grabs a House Frey piece]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: If Walder Frey cooperates.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: If Walder Frey cooperates.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Close up shots of the map showing the sigils of House Stark, House Frey and House Lannister]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB moves the House Frey piece to the House Stark side of the map]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[A flash of anger spreads across CATELYN's face]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	The next scene shows ROBB'S direwolf, Grey Wind, as he leads House Stark's army to The Twins castle, the ancestral seat of House Frey.  [The scene shifts to the inside of The Twins, as a servant walks around with a plate of bread and salt in observation of the Westerosi tradition of "Guest Right".  ROBB, his wife TALISA MAEGYR, his uncle EDMURE TULLY, his great uncle BRYNDEN "BLACKFISH" TULLY, CATELYN and the Stark army are in the presence of WALDER FREY and his family.  ROBB takes a piece of bread, dips it into the salt and eats it while looking intently at WALDER]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table.  I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Servant stops in front of WALDER.  He takes a piece of bread from the plate and eats it]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace.  It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER signals for his female relatives to appear before ROBB]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[As WALDER calls each relative by name, they briefly look up at ROBB]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: This is Arwyn, my daughter.  My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER pauses to chew]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[EDMURE intently watches the Frey women]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.  You could have had either.  Could have had both for all I care.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[EDMURE closes his eyes after hearing WALDER'S comments about his granddaughters]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: My granddaughter Marianne.  My granddaughter Freya.  My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER guessing at his granddaughter's name.  EDMURE raises his eyebrows]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MERRY: I'm Merry.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Fine.  And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet.  Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB looks at the Frey women]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: My ladies.  All men should keep their word, kings most of all.  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.  The fault is not with you.  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER claps to signal the dismissal of the Frey women]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Very good.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER focuses on TALISA]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: There she is.  Come closer, let me have a look at you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TALISA takes a couple of steps towards WALDER.  WALDER moves forward in his seat and squints]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Still can't see you.  Old eyes.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TALISA looks at ROBB who nods.  Frey men look on as she takes a couple more steps towards WALDER.  She bows her head]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Love.  That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?  Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face.  Mmmm, very pretty.  Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.  Very shapely as well.  Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.  If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER leans forward with a grin]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.  Been at this a long time.  I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.  Doesn't drop an inch.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER grins, ROBB visibly uncomfortable]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Your king says he betrayed me for love.  I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB starts to step forward before CATELYN stops him]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: And I can respect that.  When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought.  Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.  We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB visibly angry]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Thank you, my lord.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER stands up and claps]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Well, let's get ready.  The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene changes to the desert outside of the city of Yunkai on the continent of Essos.  An army of Unsullied are standing guard outside of DAENERYS TARGARYEN'S tent.  Inside her tent are her closest advisers: DAARIO NAHARIS, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH MORMONT and GREY WORM.  They are looking at a map of Yunkai]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAENERYS: Where?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAARIO points at a location on the map]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: There.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAARIO gets closer to DAENERYS, grabs and guides her hand to the location he was referring to.  JORAH watches him closely]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: There, it's a back gate.  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: Your men but not you?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: I have no interest in slaves.  A man cannot make love to property.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAENERYS briefly looks up at DAARIO and JORAH briefly looks at her]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: This is where we enter the city.  Very few guards, they know me.  They let me inside.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BARRISTAN: We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: I kill the guards.  I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAARIO nods at JORAH and GREY WORM.  JORAH looks at GREY WORM who briefly looks back]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: Then comes the army.  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.  The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: You have a very suspicious mind.  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JORAH sighs and looks at Grey Worm]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: You command the Unsullied.  What do you think?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAENERYS: [Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian] Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	GREY WORM: [In Valyrian] I trust him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAENERYS: [Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case, English) again] You leave tonight.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: Very good.  We'll prepare.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAENERYS' advisers start to leave.  DAARIO grins at DAENERYS who looks back at him.  BARRISTAN walks towards JORAH]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.  You can use an extra sword.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.  Your place is by the Queen.  If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done.  No matter the cost, no matter our pride.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene shifts to Beyond The Wall in the North.  SAMWELL TARLY, GILLY and her baby are walking south towards Castle Black]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	SAMWELL: We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.  It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.  Too big, impossible to maintain.  Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.  It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.  No one's used it for centuries, most likely.  It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[GILLY stops and looks at SAMWELL in a confused manner]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	GILLY: How do you know all that?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	SAMWELL: I read about it in a very old book.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	GILLY: You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	SAMWELL: Yes.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	GILLY: You're like a wizard.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[SAMWELL smiles.  Next shot, GILLY and SAMWELL gaze up at the Wall]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	GILLY: Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.  Here we are.  Alive.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene changes to SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE and ARYA STARK on horseback in the Riverlands, on their way to The Twins, where THE HOUND plans on returning ARYA to her mother and brother in the hopes of receiving some reward.  They see a PIG FARMER along the way who's having trouble with the wheel spokes on his cart]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Remember what happens to children who run.  I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND hands the horse reins to ARYA and walks over to the PIG FARMER]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	PIG FARMER: The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Need a hand?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	PIG FARMER: Need about eight hands.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND lifts the cart up]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	PIG FARMER: Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[PIG FARMER fixes the wheel, THE HOUND sets the cart down]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	PIG FARMER: Many thanks.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND punches the PIG FARMER in the face, knocking him to the ground.  THE HOUND then unsheathes his dagger and prepares to kill him, prompting ARYA to intervene]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: Don't! Don't kill him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Dead rats don't squeak.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people.  A real hard man you are.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: More than anyone you know.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: You're wrong.  I know a killer. A real killer.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: That so?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: You'd be like a kitten to him.  He'd kill you with his little finger.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND looks at the PIG FARMER on the ground]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: That him?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Confused, ARYA turns her head to look down at the PIG FARMER]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: No.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Good.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND again tries to approach the PIG FARMER in order to kill him but ARYA again intervenes pushing him back]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: Don't kill him!  Please.  Please don't.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND pauses then sheathes his dagger]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: You're very kind.  Someday it'll get you killed.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[PIG FARMER starts to regain consciousness.  ARYA grabs a piece of wood from the cart and hits him across the face with it, knocking him out again.  She then walks back to the horse as THE HOUND looks on surprised]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene changes to the North, south of the wall.  BRAN STARK, RICKON STARK, HODOR, JOJEN REED, MEERA REED and OSHA are walking past a windmill]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: Where are we?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: The Gift, I think.  Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support.  Maester Luwin taught me that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MEERA: It’s good land and there’s no war up here.  Why leave?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Wildlings.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BRAN looks at OSHA who stares back at him]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Sorry.  But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[OSHA stares at RICKON who looks back at her]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: That’s what Old Nan said.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: There’s a storm coming.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: I don’t see any.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Thunder rumbling, everyone looks up at the sky and at the windmill]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MEERA: It’s as good a place to shelter as any.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[They begin walking back towards the windmill.  OSHA puts her hand on RICKON’S head]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: We can drink some blood while we wait.  I don’t need much.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene changes showing ORELL’S eagle circling over an old horse breeder’s home.  JON SNOW, TORMUND GIANTSBANE, ORELL, YGRITTE are hiding, waiting for ORELL’S scouting report]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: Only one old man and eight good horses.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: What’s one old man doing with eight horses?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JON: He breeds them for the Watch.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	YGRITTE: How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JON: The Watch protects him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: Not today they don’t.  He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: And proper steel.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: Let’s carve him up.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JON: We just take the horses and go.  The old man’s no threat.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ORELL looks at TORMUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: I keep telling you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[YGRITTE looks at JON]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	YGRITTE: He’s an old man.  A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON looks at TORMUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JON: The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: I hope so.  Killing crows in their castle is tough.  Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TORMUND announces to the rest of the wildlings]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Spread out.  Surround the hut and move in.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The wildlings run towards the OLD MAN’S home.  JON smacks his sword, Longclaw, against a rock to alert the OLD MAN and his horses. Upon hearing his horses moving about, the OLD MAN steps outside and sees the wildlings running towards his home.  He gets on one of the horses and starts riding off.  YGRITTE preps her bow and arrow, aiming for the OLD MAN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JON: Ygritte!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON intervenes and YGRITTE hits a tree instead]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Clear the barn!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene changes to ARYA looking at The Twins.  They’re relatively close.  Meanwhile, THE HOUND eats pig feet by the cart.  ARYA walks back to THE HOUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA:  No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND waves a pig’s foot at ARYA]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Best part of the animal.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND continues to eat while ARYA gazes back at the Twins]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Don’t worry, they’re still there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ARYA angrily turns back and looks at THE HOUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: I know they’re still there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: I’m not afraid.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Of course you are.  You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it.  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.  No point in trying to hide behind that face.  I know fear when I see it.  Seen it a lot.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: I knew fear when I saw it in you.  You’re afraid of fire.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND pauses]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ARYA moves in closer to THE HOUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: And I know why, too.  I heard what your brother did to you.  Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: That give you some ideas?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ARYA turns her back to THE HOUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: Might do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Go ahead then.  You might get away.  Might even make it there on your own.  They’re just over the river.  The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ARYA turns around and angrily stares at THE HOUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ARYA: Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND stares back at ARYA as she walks away to get a closer look at the Twins as thunder rumbles in the sky]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene changes back to BRAN and company inside of the windmill.  The storm has already begun]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: How are we going to get past the Wall?  My uncle said it’s 700 feet high.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[OSHA looks at Bran and he looks at her]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: How did you get past it?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: Some climb straight up the ice.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BRAN looks at HODOR]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[HODOR visibly scared of the thunder]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	HODOR: Hodor!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: Nineteen castles guard the Wall.  Only three are still manned.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[HODOR still shaken from the thunder]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Hodor: Hodor!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[MEERA looks at Bran]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MEERA: Well, we’ll have to open them up again.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[MEERA gazes outside and sees the OLD MAN on horseback]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OLD MAN: [From outside] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MEERA: There’s a rider out there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: Just one?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Thunder rumbles]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MEERA: There’s more.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	HODOR: Hodor!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Horses neighing outside.  OSHA tries to quiet down HODOR]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: It’s just thunder, sweet giant.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	HODOR: Hodor.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OLD MAN: [From outside]  I yield.  I yield.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: Wildlings.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[OSHA starts turning her head then gazes outside]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: [To BRAN and RICKON]  Where’s Shaggydog and Summer?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Hunting.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Thunder rumbles]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	HODOR: Hodor!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[HODOR stands up]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: Shhh, quiet, Hodor.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	HODOR: Hodor!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: [To BRAN] Make him shut up.  If they hear us…
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: [To Hodor] Hush, Hodor.  No, no more Hodoring.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[OSHA tries to hold HODOR back but he pushes her aside and starts yelling and moving around anxiously]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	HODOR: Hodor!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[HODOR continues Hodoring]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Hodor, calm down.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: You need to keep quiet.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: They’re gonna hear us.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[HODOR continues Hodoring.  ORELL hears voices coming out of the windmill.  He stops and looks up]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Hodor, be quiet.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[HODOR continues Hodoring]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Hodor, calm down.  Hodor, be quiet!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BRAN’S eyes roll back as he wargs into HODOR.  HODOR stops making noises as he falls to his knees and then falls asleep on the ground.  ORELL is still looking up at the windmill from the outside.  Inside of the windmill, everybody is in shock at what just happened]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MEERA: [To BRAN] What did you do?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Bran: Nothing.  I don’t know.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The sound of a horse is heard from outside.  OSHA gets near the windmill opening]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: What’s That?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: That’s a horse dying.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene shifts to the wildlings who are outside of the windmill with the OLD MAN.  ORELL is still looking up at the windmill]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WILDLING 1: Bring them over here.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WILDLING 2: That was the last of them.  The rest are dead.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: [To TORMUND] I heard shouting up there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Thunder.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Maybe it's ghosts.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ORELL’s eagle is seen circling over the windmill.  TORMUND approaches the OLD MAN who is sitting on the ground.  He pulls a knife out on TORMUND, YGRITTE gets her bow and arrow out and aims for the OLD MAN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: That won’t help you, grandpa.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TORMUND sticks his hand out, asking for the knife.  The OLD MAN gives it to TORMUND, who tosses it aside]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Where you riding?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OLD MAN: Doesn’t matter now, does it?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: No, it doesn’t matter now.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TORMUND unsheathes his sword]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: You understand.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OLD MAN: Let me stand at least.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BRAN and RICKON’S direwolves, Shaggydog and Summer, are seen hiding behind a cart, outside of the windmill]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OLD MAN: Let me go with a bit of dignity.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TORMUND helps the OLD MAN get up.  He then gets in position for the kill]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Orell: [Looks at JON] Make the crow kill him. [Walks towards JON]  You’re one of us now.  Prove it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[YGRITTE, TORMUND and the OLD MAN stare back at JON.  The scene changes to back inside of the windmill]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Jojen: [Looks at BRAN]  The wolves are out there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: I can’t do it by choice.  I don’t know how.  It happens in my dreams.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: You’re a warg, Bran.  It’s in your blood.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: I can’t.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: You just did, with him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JOJEN looks at HODOR who is still resting]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: A wolf is nothing compared to that.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene switches back to outside of the windmill.  JON unsheathes Longclaw.  He places his sword against the OLD MAN’S neck]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OLD MAN: She looks sharp.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON nods his head.  The OLD MAN closes his eyes and starts praying, JON hesitates]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	YGRITTE: [Looks at Jon]  Do it.  Do it.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON looks back at YGRITTE]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: Told ya.  He’s still one of them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Go on, boy.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON glares back at TORMUND]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Go on!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON raises his sword but hesitates. YGRITTE shoots the OLD MAN in the chest with an arrow, killing him.  This prompts ORELL and TORMUND to reach for their swords]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ORELL: He’s a crow.  He’ll always be a crow.  And here’s his crow wife guarding him.  He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON and YGRITTE are standing side by side in defensive positions]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Kill him!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[YGRITTE prepares to shoot an arrow at either ORELL or TORMUND but JON pushes her to the ground first.  JON, ORELL and the other wildlings have a sword fight while TORMUND runs towards YGRITTE.  She starts yelling and screaming as TORMUND tries to restrain her]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Tormund: He’s one of them!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	YGRITTE: No!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: Do you hear me?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[YGRITTE bites TORMUND’S arm which causes him to lose his grip on her.  She starts running away but TORMUND grabs her and tackles her to the ground]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TORMUND: You’re not gonna die for one of them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene switches back to inside of the windmill.  Everybody is looking at BRAN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: Do it.  They’ll find us if you don’t.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BRAN’S eyes roll back as he wargs into Summer.  Scene goes back outside to JON fighting the wildlings.  Suddenly, the direwolves start attacking the wildlings.  JON continues fighting ORELL until he impales him with Longclaw]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JON: You were right the whole time.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JON twists his sword as ORELL wargs into his eagle right before dying.  The eagle attacks JON, biting and scratching his face.  JON tosses the eagle aside and makes a run for one of the OLD MAN’S horses.  He starts riding away as TORMUND and YGRITTE look on]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The scene changes to Yunkai.  DAARIO, JORAH and GREY WORM are outside of the back gate]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come.  I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAARIO approaches the back gate, a guard yells at him in Valyrian]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: Daario Naharis.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The guard lets DAARIO in as JORAH and GREY WORM wait.  In the distance, DAARIO whistles.  JORAH and GREY WORM go through the back gate and into Yunkai.  They see two dead guards and DAARIO sitting down]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: That one was quick.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAARIO wiping blood off his arakh, a Dothraki blade]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: There may be others.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: I doubt it.  The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Suddenly, they’re surrounded by Yunkai guards.  A brief fight ensues.  DAARIO throws a knife by JORAH’S head, killing a Yunkai guard who was behind him.  The trio defeat the first wave of guards]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: [Addressing DAARIO] That’s what you call a few guards?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAARIO smiles at JORAH as more Yunkish guards appear, surrounding the trio]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The scene changes to right outside of The Twins, where the Stark army are set up in tents and passing the time with some wrestling.  It then switches to inside of The Twins, at the wedding ceremony of EDMURE and WALDER’S daughter, ROSLIN FREY. WALDER walks the bride to the altar, her face is covered with a veil.  EDMURE is standing at the altar, looking worried, as ROBB and his family are looking on.  ROBB turns his head back towards WALDER and ROSLIN, while ROOSE BOLTON stares at ROBB.  As WALDER approaches, he trades glances with ROBB.  When WALDER and ROSLIN finally reach the altar, he removes her veil.  EDMURE'S fear of an ugly bride are put to rest when he finally sees how beautiful ROSLIN is.  ROSLIN gets down on her knees in front of EDMURE]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROSLIN: Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[EDMURE helps ROSLIN up]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	EDMURE: You’re a delight to me, my lady.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROSLIN smiles]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	SEPTON: You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[EDMURE removes his cloak as he goes behind ROSLIN to drape it over her shoulders.  ROSLIN and ROBB trade glances.  ROBB then looks at WALDER who gives him a strange look before grinning.  EDMURE finishes putting the cloak on ROSLIN, then looks at CATELYN who smiles at him.  He walks back to ROSLIN’S side and the SEPTON ties EDMURE and ROSLIN'S hands together]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	SEPTON: In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.  Look upon each other and say the words.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[EDMURE and ROSLIN turn to each other]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	EDMURE & ROSLIN: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.  I am hers (I am his) and she is mine (he is mine) from this day until the end of my days.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BLACKFISH looks at the ugly Frey women who smile back at him.  He quickly turns around]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene changes to inside of the windmill.  It’s nighttime.  OSHA lights a candle]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MEERA: Is that safe?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: They’re long gone.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: [Looks at JOJEN] You were right.  I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: Of course you can.  North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.  But you did a lot more than that.  You got inside Hodor’s mind.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Shot of HODOR still resting]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: They can’t do that north of the Wall?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JOJEN: No one can do that.  Anywhere.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: [Looks at RICKON]  When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: Where?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: He was with the wildlings.  They tried to kill him but he got away.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then.  That’s where we should go.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack.  If this many wildlings got through-
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: I already told you.  I’m not going north of the Wall.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Everything Jojen told me is true.  You saw what I did to Hodor.  I have to find the three-eyed raven.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[OSHA grabs BRAN by the hand]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: Listen to me, little lord.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me.  It won’t be safe for Rickon.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: [Surprised] Me? I’m coming with you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: No.  You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.  The Umbers are our bannermen.  They’ll protect you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: I’m coming with you.  I’m your brother.  I have to protect you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Right now, I have to protect you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[RICKON'S eyes start tearing up]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall.  If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[RICKON shakes his head with tears in his eyes]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: [Looks at OSHA]  Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: You Southerners build your big castles and you never move.  You’re easy to find.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[RICKON stands up and looks at OSHA]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: We’re not Southerners.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[RICKON turns around to look at BRAN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: And I don’t want to leave you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: Shhh.  [She grabs RICKON by the waist and sits him on her lap]  Come here, little soldier.  You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[RICKON starts crying.  BRAN looks at OSHA]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Bran: You don’t have to do any of this.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[RICKON cries as OSHA strokes his hair]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.  [To RICKON] Shhh.  We’ll be fine, you and me.  The Umbers are great warriors.  Even I heard about them growing up.  They’ll teach you how to swing a sword.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	RICKON: [Crying, looks at OSHA]  I know how to swing a sword.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[OSHA strokes RICKON’S hair and kisses him on the head.  She then gets up and helps RICKON up as well]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BRAN: You’re leaving now?  It’s the middle of the night.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: I learned to walk in darkness.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[OSHA kisses RICKON on the head again]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	OSHA: Say your good-byes, little man.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[RICKON walks one step before dropping to his knees to give BRAN a tight hug.  The Reeds look at BRAN and RICKON and then switch their gaze to OSHA]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Osha: [Looks at the Reeds] Keep this one safe.  [MEERA gives a slight nod]  He means the world to me.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Final shot of BRAN and RICKON hugging followed by a shot of OSHA and RICKON exiting the windmill, with Shaggydog leading the way]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Scene shifts to DAENERYS’ tent outside of the city of Yunkai.  It’s nighttime and there are Unsullied soldiers surrounding the tent.  The next shot is inside of the tent.  BARRISTAN is having a drink, MISSANDEI presents some food to DAENERYS who is sitting down.  She suddenly gets up and ignores the food, as she approaches BARRISTAN with impatience]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	Daenerys: We’ve been waiting a long time. [BARRISTAN looks at her]  Haven’t we?  [BARRISTAN shrugs]  Well I don’t know, you tell me.  How long does it take to sack a city?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BARRISTAN briefly ponders the question before JORAH, GREY WORM and several Unsullied guards arrive.  JORAH and GREY WORM are both tired and covered in blood]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	JORAH: [Looks at DAENERYS]  It was just as you said.  They did not believe until it was too late.  Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAENERYS likes the news but her face suddenly shows some worry]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAENERYS: And Daario Naharis?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[JORAH’S face goes from a smile to a look of shock.  Suddenly, DAARIO emerges from behind the Unsullied guards, with a Yunkai flag draped over his shoulder and his face covered in blood.  He walks towards DAENERYS and drops to one knee.  He drapes the flag over his knee and looks up at DAENERYS]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	DAARIO: The city is yours, my queen.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[DAENERYS starts to smile]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The scene shifts to the wedding celebration inside of The Twins.  A band is playing music on the balcony of the hall.  WALDER is seated on the high chair at the main table, underneath the balcony where the musicians are playing.  Seated to his left are ROSLIN and EDMURE.  Seated to his right is his wife, JOYEUSE FREY.  Stark men and Frey men and women are celebrating the marriage.  TALISA is seated at a table towards the front, near WALDER'S main table.  Next to her is LOTHAR FREY, one of WALDER'S many sons]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: [Looking at the band and talking to LOTHAR] They’re good, aren’t they?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	LOTHAR: They ought to be because they cost enough.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB takes a drink and starts laughing.  Next shot is from across the hall, where ROOSE, BLACKFISH and CATELYN are seated, enjoying themselves]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BLACKFISH: Look at the crowd there.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Seated next to BLACKFISH is WENDEL MANDERLY of House Manderly.  Next to him is BLACK WALDER FREY, another one of WALDER'S sons]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: [Looking at EDMURE and talking to BLACKFISH] He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Shot of EDMURE whispering in ROSLIN'S ear as she smiles]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BLACKFISH: The God’s love to reward a fool.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: [Laughs] Uncle.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BLACKFISH: What? He’s my nephew, I love him.  And he’s a damned fool.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[CATELYN and BLACKFISH both laugh.  A servant tries to pour some wine into ROOSE'S cup but he covers it with his hand before she can pour anything.  CATELYN looks at ROOSE]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROOSE: Never do, my lady.  Dulls the senses.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BLACKFISH: That’s the point. [Still talking to ROOSE while the servant pours him more wine] Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROOSE: Aye.  Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry.  So I have a fat, young bride.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROOSE smiles and BLACKFISH laughs.  CATELYN gives ROOSE a serious look]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: I hope she makes you very happy.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROOSE: Well, she’s made me very rich.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	BLACKFISH: Pardon, my lord, my lady.  I need to find a tree to piss on.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[BLACKFISH gets up from his seat and begins exiting the hall, as ROBB and TALISA look on]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton.  I should rescue her.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Be kind.  She’s finally starting to like you.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: And I like her.  But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there [Looks at EDMURE and ROSLIN], eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TALISA gasps and tries to strike ROBB but he catches her hand]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Striking your king is an act of treason.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB and TALISA look at each other before ROBB tries to kiss her.  TALISA stops him]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: No, don’t.  Don’t insult them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: [Addressing ROBB loudly so everybody can hear] Your Grace.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Everybody starts knocking on the tables.  WALDER signals for the music and knocking to stop]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.  But they are not yet man and wife.  A sword needs a sheath [Everybody laughs]. And a wedding needs a bedding [Everybody cheers].  What does my sire say?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	EVERYBODY: [Knocking on the tables, chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: [Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Everybody cheers, the band starts playing celebratory music again.  EDMURE smiles, ROSLIN looks concerned.  Men start getting up from their seats and approach the main table]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	EVERYBODY: [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The men pick up ROSLIN and carry her out of the hall.  The women grab EDMURE and start bringing him out as well. TALISA looks worried when she sees ROSLIN being carried away.  Everybody is cheering on.  The men start removing some of ROSLIN'S clothes while the women start doing the same to EDMURE]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	EDMURE: Ho-ho!  Careful now, ladies.  Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again [Laughs].
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB looks on smiling and clapping.  TALISA looks at ROBB with a worried look]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	EVERYBODY: [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROOSE and CATELYN look at ROSLIN and EDMURE being carried out of the hall]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Poor girl.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROOSE: Every bride suffers the same.  I’m sure you endured yours with grace.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Oh, Ned forbade it.  He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROOSE looks at CATELYN and chuckles before walking away]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB and TALISA watch as the bedding procession is almost finished]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: That is a very strange custom.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: It seems normal to you?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: It’s tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB]  Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[TALISA puts her hand on ROBB'S shoulder, runs it down his arm, before grabbing his hand and placing it on her stomach]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: No, but there are other ways of providing proof.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Boy or girl?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: I don’t know.  But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Oh, do you?   It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	TALISA: Eddard. [Catches ROBB by surprise] Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: I do.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB and TALISA kiss.  CATELYN looks on and smiles as BLACK WALDER walks towards the door of the hall to close it.  He walks back and the band starts playing the Lannister song, “The Rains of Castamere.”  The band’s expression is very serious and the song isn’t as cheerful as their previous songs.  CATELYN looks up at the band with a worried expression.  Scene changes to outside of The Twins, Grey Wind is locked up in a kennel, whimpering, sensing something is wrong as Frey soldiers are on the move.  The scene then changes again to the main gate of The Twins, where the tents are set up and men are still celebrating. THE HOUND and ARYA approach the gate, riding the pig farmer’s cart]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[Three Frey guards stop THE HOUND and ARYA from entering The Twins]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	FREY GUARD: Where are you going?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Got salt pork for the feast.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	FREY GUARD: The feast is over.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: It doesn’t sound like it’s over.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ARYA watches as Frey soldiers run into the Twins]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	FREY GUARD: If I tell you it’s over, it’s over.  [Angrily] Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: Got pig’s feet, too [ARYA looks up].
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	FREY GUARD: [Infuriated] Are you soft in the head?  Turn this cart around!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND gives up.  As he looks back, he notices that ARYA is not in the cart.  The scene then switches back to the hall inside of The Twins.  WALDER signals for everybody to be quiet.  He addresses ROBB]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: Your Grace.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[WALDER stands up with a cup in his hand.  Everybody takes a seat except ROBB.  ROOSE returns to the hall and sits next to CATELYN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[CATELYN looks scared.  ROOSE slowly turns his head to look at CATELYN.  He's smiling as he looks down at his arm, inviting CATELYN to take a look]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve.  My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[CATELYN pulls back ROOSE'S sleeve, she sees that he’s wearing chainmail.  She starts gasping as ROOSE stares at her.  She suddenly gets up from her seat and slaps ROOSE across the face, prompting him to run to the other side of the hall]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Robb!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[LOTHAR pulls a knife out of his sleeve and repeatedly stabs TALISA in the stomach from behind.  She starts screaming as ROBB looks on in horror.  As ROBB starts to approach her, the band now have crossbows and they shoot arrows at Robb, hitting him.  The rest of the Frey men in the hall start slaughtering the Stark men.  ROBB is repeatedly shot with arrows and falls to the ground.  TALISA falls to the ground in agony.  CATELYN in shock over ROBB, gets hit in the shoulder by an arrow, making her fall down.  As the massacre continues, WALDER smiles and sips from his cup.  The scene then switches to ARYA sneaking into The Twins.  She hides behind a barrel and watches some Stark men eating with Frey men in front of the kennel that Grey Wind is in]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MAN 1: [Laughing] You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh? [Men laughing]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ARYA grins]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	MAN 2: Feast over yet, is it?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	FREY MAN: Aye, it’s over! [Slit’s the throat of a Stark soldier]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[The Frey men kill the Stark men.  They flip over the table and march off as ARYA hides in the shadows of the barrels.  ARYA can hear Grey Wind whimpering as he tries to break out of the locked kennel.  She goes behind the flipped over table and sees Grey Wind jumping up and down.  Suddenly, Frey men appear with crossbows.  Grey Wind growls at them before they shoot him to death.  ARYA is horrified.  She watches as Grey Wind takes his last breath and dies.  She then notices more Frey men emerging from a doorway.  She starts walking towards the doorway until THE HOUND puts his hand on her shoulder and turns her around]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	THE HOUND: It’s too late.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[THE HOUND hits ARYA on the back of the head, knocking her out.  He carries her over his shoulder and starts exiting The Twins.  The scene then changes to CATELYN crawling underneath the table at the hall with the arrow still lodged in her shoulder.  She notices JOYEUSE hiding underneath the main table.  ROBB gazes at TALISA laying on the ground with her hand on her bloodied stomach.  He starts crawling towards her.  WALDER notices and signals for everybody to stop]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: The King in the North arises, heh heh.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB places one hand on TALISA'S stomach and lifts her head up with his other hand.  She has already died.  CATELYN grabs a dagger and emerges from under the table.  She grabs JOYEUSE by the hair and drags her out from under the main table.  CATELYN presses the dagger against JOYEUSE'S throat as WALDER looks on.  The archers fix their sights on CATELYN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Lord Walder!  Lord Walder, enough!  Let it end!  Please!  He is my son! [ROBB is still cradling TALISA on the floor]  My first son!  Let him go and I swear that we will forget this!  I swear it by the Old Gods and New!  We will take no vengeance.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: [Angrily] You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.  You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB lays TALISA'S head on the ground]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: Take me for a hostage but let Robb go!  Robb, get up! Get up and walk out!  Please!  Please!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: And why I would let him do that?
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[CATELYN straightens up and presses the dagger harder against JOYEUSE'S neck]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	CATELYN: On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife’s throat!
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB starts to stand up]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	WALDER: I’ll find another.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROBB turns to CATELYN]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROBB: Mother.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[CATELYN turns to ROBB with tears in her eyes as ROOSE suddenly reappears in front of ROBB.  He faces ROBB and grabs him by the shoulder]
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	ROOSE: The Lannisters send their regards.
s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[ROOSE thrusts a dagger into ROBB'S heart. While still staring at CATELYN, ROBB dies and collapses to the floor next to TALISA.  CATELYN wails loudly while WALDER takes a sip from his cup.  She slits JOYEUSE'S throat with the dagger, killing her.  JOYEUSE falls to the ground with blood spraying from her neck and CATELYN drops the dagger.  She looks on hopelessly, in a dreary daze.  After a long pause, BLACK WALDER finally emerges behind CATELYN and slits her throat, killing her.  She falls to the floor with blood spraying from her neck]

s03e09	The Rains of Castamere	[End Credits.  No music]
s03e10	Mhysa	EXT: THE TWINS, NIGHT
s03e10	Mhysa	LORD ROOSE BOLTON climbs the stairs to the top of the Twins. The sounds of the battle below draw him to the edge. The Stark camp is engulfed in flames as the battle rages on.
s03e10	Mhysa	CUT TO: THE STARK ENCAMPMENT
s03e10	Mhysa	The battle outside the castle walls is fierce. Stark bannermen and Frey forces battle for their lives. Swords clash, and some men are set aflame. One man is strung up by his neck into the trees.
s03e10	Mhysa	MAN: It's too late.
s03e10	Mhysa	Man #2: Yah! Yah!
s03e10	Mhysa	THE HOUND rides out from the castle, LADY ARYA STARK slumped in front of him. He surveys the battle and picks up a Frey banner as he rides by. He urges his mount forward and they trot into the flames.
s03e10	Mhysa	MAN: Go, move out!
s03e10	Mhysa	THE HOUND pauses amidst the blinding smoke and flames. His horse whinnies nerviously. The chants of the Frey men grow louder.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY MEN: The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
s03e10	Mhysa	Frey men march out of the castle. Mounted behind them, KING ROBB STARK's headless body has been turned into a grotesque effigy - it is tied roughly onto a post, with the head of his direwolf, Grey Wind, mounted to the corpse's shoulders.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY MEN: The King in the North! The King in the North!
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY MAN: Here comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North!
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA rouses in front of THE HOUND. She watches in horror as the Frey men lead the awkward effigy into the yard.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY MEN: The King in the North! The King in the North!
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY MAN: Here comes
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA is dejected and THE HOUND has fear in his eyes. He spurs the horse forward, and they ride away through the fire and battle. A Stark banner succumbs to the flames.
s03e10	Mhysa	EXT: KING'S LANDING, GARDENS
s03e10	Mhysa	LADY SANSA STARK and LORD TYRION LANNISTER stroll side-by-side through the gardens on a beautiful day. SHAE follows, a few paces back. SER ELDRICK SARSFIELD and LORD DESMOND CRAKEHALL pass, snickering at them
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: What are you doing?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: I have a list.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: A list of people you mean to kill?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: You should learn to ignore them.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: (laughs)
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION realizes that SHAE overheard that comment. He looks back, embarrassed, and she returns his look, cooly.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: So how should we punish them?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Who? Whom?
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: I hear that you're a pervert.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: (chuckles) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Lady Sansa!
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Why sheep shift?
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: That's the vulgar word for dung.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: My lady-
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA: Well, you asked me.
s03e10	Mhysa	PODRICK PAYNE runs down the steps of the garden, looking for TYRION.
s03e10	Mhysa	GIRL: Oh! That's him!
s03e10	Mhysa	PODRICK: My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: THE HAND'S CHAMBERS
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION enters. LORD TYWIN LANNISTER, QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER, VARYS, and GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE are already seated. KING JOFFREY BARATHEON walks behind his grandfather, excited and grinning.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Killed a few puppies today?
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: Show him. Come on, show him.
s03e10	Mhysa	Hand shaking, PYCELLE offers a scroll to TYRION. He drops it before TYRION can grab it.
s03e10	Mhysa	PYCELLE: Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers.
s03e10	Mhysa	Annoyed, TYRION reaches to the floor and snatches the scroll. He reads it. JOFFREY is manic with energy.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: 'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. (to Pycelle) Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: No. She is no longer yours to torment.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
s03e10	Mhysa	The room goes silent. JOFFREY is aghast at the slight.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: I could have your tongue out for saying that.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI takes JOFFREY's hand to calm him.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
s03e10	Mhysa	PYCELLE: Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY pulls his hand free from his mother's caress.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: I am the king! I will punish you.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
s03e10	Mhysa	Once again, the room goes silent as the depth of the insult sinks in.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI stands and tries to lead JOFFREY away.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Come along.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: I'm not tired.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI pulls JOFFREY towards the door.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOFFREY: I'm not tired!
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Come.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI and JOFFREY exit. PYCELLE stands, takes the scroll from the table, and shuffles out. Next, VARYS rises smoothly to depart. TYRION cautiously swivels to leave as well.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Not you.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION measures the situation as VARYS exits.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: You really think a crown gives you power?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION sits back down at the table.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: No. I think armies give you power.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Mm-hmm.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Mm-hmm.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: I'm all for cheating. This is war.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: So that's why you did it? To save lives?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: The Northerners will never forget.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN gathers his paper and stands.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN places the papers on his desk as TYRION approaches.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: I will not rape her.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: (smirks)
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Does that amuse you?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: Easy for me, is it?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN: The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYWIN walks away.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION enters to find SANSA staring out the window.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Sansa.
s03e10	Mhysa	SANSA turns to him. Her face is wet and swollen from crying. She looks at TYRION with disdain. She turns back to the window, and TYRION lets her be.
s03e10	Mhysa	EXT: THE NORTH
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA REED jogs across the rough landscape, bow in her hand and SUMMER at her side. She reaches JOJEN REED, LORD BRAN STARK, and HODOR.
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: It's empty.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: Let's find a place to sleep.
s03e10	Mhysa	They walk together.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER
s03e10	Mhysa	A fire crackles behind HODOR as he looks down into a well. He plays with his echo.
s03e10	Mhysa	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Don't, Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	HODOR stops and joins the others. MEERA whittles while JOJEN cooks at the fire. BRAN sits pensively, his hand exploring the rough wooden table at his side.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Maybe we shouldn't stay.
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: You'd rather be out there?
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: I always quite liked the horrible stories.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: So did I. Once.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN moves to sit with the others.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: No. Who's he?
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: THE TWINS, DINING HALL
s03e10	Mhysa	LORD WALDER FREY eats noisily in the large, empty dining hall. ROOSE BOLTON sands nearby. Servants scrub blood from the floor.
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: 'The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun. (laughs)
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: The Blackfish escaped.
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: As you say.
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: You'll be needing a new young girl.
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: (grunts)
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: (nods)
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: Well, here's to the Young Wolf! (howls)
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: Forever young.
s03e10	Mhysa	They both laugh.
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
s03e10	Mhysa	WALDER FREY: Oh. And?
s03e10	Mhysa	ROOSE BOLTON: Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY SNOW sits, merrily eating a sausage. LORD THEON GREYJOY is strapped once again to the X-shaped cross.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock.
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON looks up accusingly at RAMSAY, who mugs a reaction of shock.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON sulks.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
s03e10	Mhysa	He holds up a pork sausage as a visual aid.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY shakes the sausage. THEON winces and whimpers. He begins to weep. RAMSAY takes a bite.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: (cries)
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: But my father taught me to aim for their head.
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: Kill me.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: Sorry, what?
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: Kill me.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: A little louder.
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: Kill me!
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON begins to sob.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: You're no good to me dead. We need you.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY rises from the table and walks over to THEON. He grabs THEON's hair and pulls his head back.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat.
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: (groans)
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: Stinking meat.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY sniffs THEON.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: Theon Greyjoy.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY gives THEON a powerful slap.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: What's your name?
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: Th- Theon Greyjoy.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY punches THEON harder.
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: Please.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY grabs THEON's neck with both hands and throttles him.
s03e10	Mhysa	RAMSAY: What is your name?!
s03e10	Mhysa	THEON: Reek. My name is Reek.
s03e10	Mhysa	Satisfied and victorious, RAMSAY releases THEON and walks away. THEON weeps again.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT
s03e10	Mhysa	The wind howls outside. A distant gasp startles BRAN awake.  SUMMER paces as the gasping continues.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	HODOR wakes. MEERA draws her knife reflexively as she jumps to consciousness. The gasps continue. SUMMER growls. Footsteps approach. A figure rises from the well, clanging and groaning. The huge figure enters through the trap door, which clangs shut behind him. MEERA yells and jumps the figure, pinning him to the ground, knife at his throat. It is SAMWELL TARLY.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: Don't kill me!
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: Who are you?
s03e10	Mhysa	GILLY enters, frantic, holding her BABY.
s03e10	Mhysa	GILLY: Sam! Sam!
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: Who are you?!
s03e10	Mhysa	GILLY: Gilly. Don't hurt us.
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA releases SAM and he gets up from the floor.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: Where are you going?
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: My brother, he's in the Night's-
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: Shush.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: Who's your brother?
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: Doesn't matter.
s03e10	Mhysa	SUMMER growls. SAM realizes that BRAN has a direwolf.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: No, I'm not.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	HODOR: Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Take us north of the Wall.
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA sheaths her knife and goes to inspect the well.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: What? Why in the world would you want to go-
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: I don't want to. I have to.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: How did you get through the Wall?
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
s03e10	Mhysa	GILLY: Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: How do you know all that?
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
s03e10	Mhysa	Everyone is silent. Birds call in the distance. The BABY fusses.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: But you're going to stop them?
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to.
s03e10	Mhysa	EXT: THE IRON ISLANDS, DAY
s03e10	Mhysa	A lone rider gallops towards the Pyke.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: THE PYKE
s03e10	Mhysa	LORD BALON GREYJOY sits at a cluttered table. LADY YARA GREYJOY stands nearby. BALON opens a leather tube to reveal a scroll. He draws out the scroll, and recognizes the wax seal of the Flayed Man. He breaks the seal and unrolls the scroll.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON: 'Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home.
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA carefully unwraps the burlap and twine from around a package. Inside is a small chest. She frees the clasp.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON: On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON stands as YARA opens the box. She is stonefaced. BALON joins her, and offers a similarly sober reaction.  He returns to reading the scroll.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON: 'Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight.
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA looks at BALON.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON: Theon disobeyed my orders.
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA gives BALON a challenging look.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON: The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me.
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA: He's your son.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON: Son? He's not a man anymore.
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA: He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON: Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
s03e10	Mhysa	BALON sits by the fire.
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA: And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
s03e10	Mhysa	CUT TO: YARA aboard an Ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA: (voiceover) I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
s03e10	Mhysa	MAN: Get those ropes!
s03e10	Mhysa	The crew prepares the ship for travel. The Pyke stands in the distance. YARA is in command.
s03e10	Mhysa	YARA: (voiceover) I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.

s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN inspects the dragonglass knife.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: What is it?
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN: Dragonglass.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
s03e10	Mhysa	JOJEN takes a dragonglass knife from SAM and inspects it.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Why? What are they for?
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM and GILLY exchange a long look.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: Killing White Walkers.
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA: How do you know that?
s03e10	Mhysa	GILLY: The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
s03e10	Mhysa	MEERA:  But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM offers a dragonglass knife to HODOR, who refuses it. BRAN takes it and hands it him.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: Take it, Hodor.
s03e10	Mhysa	HODOR looks at the remarkable knife. SAM hands dragonglass arrowheads to MEERA.
s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN: I wish I could. I really do.
s03e10	Mhysa	BRAN, HODOR, MEERA, and JOJEN walk to the northern exit of the tunnel. SAM and GILLY watch them go.

s03e10	Mhysa	SER DAVOS SEAWORTH approaches GENDRY's cell. GENDRY sits with his back to the bars.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: How are you keeping?
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Great. Never better.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: It was just a bit of blood.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I'm not a highborn.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: She called you Ser. I heard it.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS sits down, mirroring GENDRY on the other side of the bars.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I lived below the Street of Flour.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Gin Alley.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.
s03e10	Mhysa	They both chuckle.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: So how'd you become a lord?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Oh, that's a long story.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS shows GENDRY his half-fingers.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: You see? Highborns.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Why did you?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Does he?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: He's dead.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS stands up.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: How'd he die?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Following me.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS exits.

s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE stares out at the ships in the harbor. VARYS approaches behind her.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: When did you come to this strange country?
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: When I was thirteen.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: You were only a child.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: No, I expect not.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: I have a name.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: What do you want from me, Lord Varys?
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS hands SHAE a small bag of diamonds.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: Why do you want me to leave?
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS: Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time.
s03e10	Mhysa	VARYS moves to leave
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: Lord Varys.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE tosses the bag of diamonds at VARYS's feet.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE: If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHAE exits.

s03e10	Mhysa	PODRICK: I don't think I can, my lord.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION pours more wine for each of them.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI enters from the garden.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Leave.
s03e10	Mhysa	PODRICK stands and exits.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI pours herself some wine.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: She doesn't deserve this.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: (chuckles)
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: So she can have some happiness in her life.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: You have children. How happy would you say you are?
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Even Joffrey?
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI sits.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: How long does it go on?
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI: Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
s03e10	Mhysa	TYRION: Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.

s03e10	Mhysa	THE HOUND and ARYA ride past four laughing Frey soldiers.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER #2: Aye, not for long.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER #3: That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA slides off the horse and lands on her feet.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER #2: You sewed it on?
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: I did.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER #2: I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA comes up behind the men. They notice her.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: What do you want?
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA: Mind if I keep warm?
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER #2: Fuck off.
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA: But I'm hungry.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA: I've got money.
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA produces the silver Braavosi coin from her belt.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: What kind of coin is that?
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA: It's worth a lot.
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA drops the coin in front of the FREY SOLDIER.
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA: Sorry.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER: Little shit.
s03e10	Mhysa	The FREY SOLDIER reaches down for the coin. ARYA pushes him down by the neck and stabs the FREY SOLDIER repeatedly.
s03e10	Mhysa	FREY SOLDIER #2: Fool!
s03e10	Mhysa	The other three soldiers rise to attack, but THE HOUND appears to shield her. The Frey soldiers attack THE HOUND. He punches one in the face and slices another across the gut. He dodges a blow and disarms the third. He then dispatches the two soldiers who remain standing. ARYA watches, awestruck. She stands up as THE HOUND deals a final blow.
s03e10	Mhysa	HOUND: Where did you get the knife?
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA: From you.
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA holds up the knife, emotionless. THE HOUND takes it.
s03e10	Mhysa	HOUND: Is that the first man you've killed?
s03e10	Mhysa	ARYA: The first man.
s03e10	Mhysa	HOUND: Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first.
s03e10	Mhysa	THE HOUND walks to the soldier's fire and starts eating their meal. ARYA bends down and picks up her Braavosi coin.

s03e10	Mhysa	JON: Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.
s03e10	Mhysa	YGRITTE: (grunts)

s03e10	Mhysa	JON: I do know some things. I know I love you.
s03e10	Mhysa	YGRITTE grunts and draws her bow harder in rage.
s03e10	Mhysa	JON: I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
s03e10	Mhysa	YGRITTE fights back tears. JON turns and she looses an arrow into his shoulder. JON falls to the ground, grunting in pain. YGRITTE notches another arrow as JON lurches up and grabs onto his horse. YGRITTE hesitates. JON mounts and YGRITTE puts an arrow into his leg. JON cries out and spurs his horse. YGRITTE has found her resolve. She notches another arrow, tracks him, and shoots him a third time as he gallops away. She begins to weep.

s03e10	Mhysa	SAM: He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us.

s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Well, your father's not going to go to that.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHIREEN sits next to DAVOS. He puts the scroll back on the table.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHIREEN: My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
s03e10	Mhysa	SHIREEN: 'His fangs were as long as bastard swords.'
s03e10	Mhysa	SHIREEN moves back to the bed.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'

s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Aegon Targaryen.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE touches STANNIS's shoulder. He turns, and then walks to face the sea.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?

s03e10	Mhysa	They wade into the water.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: I know not to drink seawater.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Where should I go?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: The gold cloaks are looking for me.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: No.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY boards the rowboat and sits.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: The other way.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY turns around in the boat and sits at the oarlocks.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: You ever been in a boat before?

s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: You know how to swim?
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: No.

s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS pushes the rowboat away from the shore.
s03e10	Mhysa	GENDRY: Why are you doing this?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.

s03e10	Mhysa	JAIME is quiet and humble. He exchanges a look with BRIENNE, who nods encouragingly. They walk into the clamor.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: CERSEI'S CHAMBERS
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI sits, admiring a collection of exotic shells, reliving a memory. JAIME enters quietly behind her.
s03e10	Mhysa	JAIME: Cersei.
s03e10	Mhysa	CERSEI looks up and gasps. They measure one another. She notices JAIME's hand. He looks down.
s03e10	Mhysa	INT: DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS stands before some guards. STANNIS and MELISANDRE interrogate him.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: You don't deny it?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: No. I let him go.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Aye, I do.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: There has got to be another way.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: Take him away.
s03e10	Mhysa	The guards start to wrestle DAVOS away.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: Why am I gonna need you?
s03e10	Mhysa	Davos produces a scroll and holds it out for STANNIS.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: My king.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS takes the scroll and reads it.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS hands scroll to MELISANDRE. She reads it.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: When did you learn to read?
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE burns the scroll.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS: You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: I've made my decision.
s03e10	Mhysa	MELISANDRE: He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
s03e10	Mhysa	STANNIS: (chuckles) You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAVOS and MELISANDRE look at one another.
s03e10	Mhysa	EXT: OUTSIDE YUNKAI
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS TARGARYEN, MISSANDEI, SER JORAH MORMONT, SER BARRISTAN SELMY, and DAARIO NAHARIS stand on the rocks, surrounded by the Unsullied and the Dothraki. The dragons chitter as they wait outside Yunkai.
s03e10	Mhysa	BARRISTAN: They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS: Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
s03e10	Mhysa	JORAH: You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS: People learn to love their chains.
s03e10	Mhysa	The door opens and a crowd pours out. Each wears a collar around their neck. As they get close to DAENERYS, the Unsullied, as one, take a defensive position, spears pointed at the crowd. A dragon screeches.
s03e10	Mhysa	MISSANDEI: (speaking Valyrian) This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS: No.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS surveys the crowd.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS: (speaking Valyrian)  You do not owe me your freedom.  I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you.
s03e10	Mhysa	The crowd is silent until one man, holding his daughter, calls out.
s03e10	Mhysa	MAN: Mhysa!
s03e10	Mhysa	DAUGHTER: Mhysa!
s03e10	Mhysa	The whole crowd joins in the shouting.
s03e10	Mhysa	CROWD:  Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS: What does it mean?
s03e10	Mhysa	MISSANDEI: It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'.
s03e10	Mhysa	The crowd steps closer and they continue to call to DAENERYS. The Unsullied take a more threatening stance to hold them back. Panic and fear begin to ripple through the confused crowd. They regain their voice and renew their cries.
s03e10	Mhysa	CROWD: Mhysa! Mhysa!  Mhysa.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS: It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS steps forward  kneels next to her three dragons.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Fly.
s03e10	Mhysa	The dragons screach and launch to the sky. DAENERYS steps down among the Unsullied.
s03e10	Mhysa	CROWD: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS:  (in Valyrian) Let me pass
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS walks into the crowd. The touch her gently as she passes through them. They are elated, and they continue to chant to her.
s03e10	Mhysa	CROWD: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!
s03e10	Mhysa	DAENERYS walks deep into the crowd. They lift her up above them, and she sits on their shoulders as the crowd reaches towards her. They spin slowly and the crowd forms rings around her. She smiles and the crowd tightens into a spiral of adulation. The Unsullied remain in formation. The dragons soar overhead.

s04e01	Two Swords	INT. KING'S LANDING
s04e01	Two Swords	The camera pans up to the hold of a sword hewn from Valeryan steel. Tywin draws it and hands it to a blacksmith, who knocks its hilt off with a hammer, and then places the blade into the forge. It melts into molten sludge and is then recast into two swords. Tywin throws the carcass of a wolf into the fire.
s04e01	Two Swords	INT. Jaime holds up a sword, admiring it.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Magnificent.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  Mm-hmm.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Looks fresh-forged.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: It is.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: From someone who no longer had need of it.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME nods and hefts the blade.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: And now we have two.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Two?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Well, thank you. It's glorious.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME attempts to sheath the sword into the cover lying on the table, but fails awkwardly. TYWIN starts as the sheath bobbles.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: You'll have to train your left hand.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: You'll never be as good.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Home?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME:You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: No.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  No?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: No.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: I don't believe I asked you a question.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: There's my answer.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  If you think your bloody honor comes before...
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  What do you want?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Supper would be nice.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: I suppose you want the sword back.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN:  Keep it.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME grabs the sword.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYWIN: A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME picks up the sword and exits
s04e01	Two Swords	EXT. Outside King's Landing
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION, PODRICK and BRONN stand on a road leading to King's Landing. BRONN holds a sigil with both stag and lion. Commoners dot the road in their daily routine. A peasant leads two reluctant, bleating goats past them.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Please don't.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: Oh.
s04e01	Two Swords	Hoofbeats approach.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Ah, here we are.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION claps.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Can you read the sigils?
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: Yellow balls?
s04e01	Two Swords	PODRICK: Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: I need a sigil.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION:  And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?
s04e01	Two Swords	PODRICK: I don't see it, my lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION nods and steps foward to greet th first Dornish lords that approach on horsebak.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.
s04e01	Two Swords	DORNISH LORD: The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: (Nods.) Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.
s04e01	Two Swords	DORNISH LORD: Will he?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: And where is Prince Oberyn?
s04e01	Two Swords	DORNISH LORD: Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.
s04e01	Two Swords	The Dornish lords advance rudely, before TYRION can finish his welcome.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: You must be weary after such a long journey.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION, BRONN and PODRICK must step aside to make way. PODRICK struggles with his sigil. They begin walking back to the city.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION:  We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.
s04e01	Two Swords	CUT TO: INTERIOR, brothel
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN walks behind a row of prostitutes, taking their measure. He comes around to face them, walking past OLYVAR. ELLARIA lounges behind him, as he decides upon WHORE #1.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Look at this one. How lovely is she?
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: Beautiful. But pale.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN removes her tunic.  Do I frighten you?
s04e01	Two Swords	WHORE #1: (Shakes her head no, looking down. )
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: You like?
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: Timid. Timid bores me.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN moves to WHORE #2, the next in line. She has been meeting the gaze of the Dornish visitors.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?
s04e01	Two Swords	WHORE #1, scuttles shyly to dress herself.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: I think she likes you. ELLARIA" She has good taste.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: You're not timid, are you?
s04e01	Two Swords	WHORE #2 saunters forward, smirking, and acrobatically balances on her left foot while pulling her right foot behind her to touch her head.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: (Laughs) Not timid.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN:  Do you like women?
s04e01	Two Swords	WHORE #2: When they look like her, my lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: This one will do nicely.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: Very good, my lady.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: Oh, I'm not a lady.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: A term of courtesy in this establishment.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: Any of the others?
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN:  The two girls can leave.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR snaps his fingers and turns to leave.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN:  You stay.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN:  Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR:  My lord.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN:  I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN:  Take off your clothes.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN, opens OLYVAR"s tunic and caresses him. Meanwhile ELLARIA and WHORE #2 are kissing and fondling one another.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: Which way do you like it?
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN roughly grabs OLYVAR's cock.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: (Gasps)
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: My way  .
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN: And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere.  And now the rains
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN is perturbed by the singing.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: Oberyn.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN:  Weep o'er his hall...
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN moves towards the source of the singing.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA:  Oberyn, don't.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA gets up and hands her wine to WHORE #2 and follows OBERYN, concerned.
s04e01	Two Swords	CUT TO: A nearby room in the brothel.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN and MORGAN'S FRIEND sit entangled with their prostitutes. One of them is singing.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN:   With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains  weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN enters.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN'S FRIEND: You lost, friend?
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN'S FRIEND: I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: We don't like the smell. (Laughs)
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA grabs OBERYN to persuade him to leave. OLYVAR enters behind them.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA: Come with me, lover.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN: Gods, look at this one.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLYVAR: Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN: Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil. (Laughs)
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN walks towards the men. MORGAN and MORGAN"S FRIEND rise to his challenge, and their whores flee the room.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN grabs towards his weapon on the table, but OBERYN is faster. He pierces MORGAN's hand with his dagger, and traps it against the table.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN: (Screams)
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN'S FRIEND grabs the hilt of his blade and begins to draw.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN twists the blade
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN: (Groans)
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN'S FRIEND ponders while MORGAN groans and OBERYN smiles devilishly.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION and BRONN enter swiftly.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN'S FRIEND pops his sword back and OBERYN flicks his dagger free from the table, and MORGAN's hand. MORGAN lets out a cry of anguish and then he and his friend move away quickly.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: trouble.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA moves to OBERYN, and caresses him.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Apologies, my love.
s04e01	Two Swords	MORGAN'S FRIEND helps MORGAN though the door to exit. OBERYN and ELLARIA kiss passionately. TYRION and BRONN exchange a puzzled look.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
s04e01	Two Swords	Reluctantly, OBERYN and ELLARIA release their embrace.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: What are you? His hired killer?
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: How did that come to pass?
s04e01	Two Swords	BRONN: Killed the right people, I suppose.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN laughs. BRONN joins him.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?
s04e01	Two Swords	Comically, BRONN nods while TYRION shakes his head.  OBERYN. You don't partake?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA continues to kiss OBERYN.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?
s04e01	Two Swords	ELLARIA releases her embrace and OBERYN signals for her to go.
s04e01	Two Swords	EXT. Outside of the brothel.
s04e01	Two Swords	The door opens and TYRION and OBERYN emerge.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Oh, they take all kinds.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Even Dornishmen.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: (Chuckles)
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: I was invited to the royal wedding.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I thought we were speaking truth.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city...
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I wasn't actually present.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION's gaze is cast downward, so OBERYN takes his chin and meets his eyes.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: I'm asking you a question.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I've heard rumors.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: (Chuckles) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
s04e01	Two Swords	OBERYN: If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS sits with DROGON nuzzling her, while VISERION and RHAEGAL fly in the distance. DAENERYS chuckles and strokes DROGON, soothing him. JORAH walks up. VISERION and RHAEGAL tussle in midair over a carcass, which lands before the rock where DAENERYS sits. The two dragons follow, fighting to claim the meat. DROGON rises to his haunches, and roars. The other dragons submit and DROGON moves to take the carcass. JORAH comes closer.
s04e01	Two Swords	JORAH: They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother.
s04e01	Two Swords	CUT TO: ESSOS EXTERIOR
s04e01	Two Swords	The unsullied stand at the ready. DAENERYS and JORAH approach, followed by three Dothraki. They walk up tot join BARRISTAN SELMY and MISSANDEI in front of the troops.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: Ser Barristan.
s04e01	Two Swords	BARRISTAN: Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
s04e01	Two Swords	BARRISTAN: Gambling, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: Gambling?
s04e01	Two Swords	Annoyed, DAENERYS strides forward. MISSANDEI follows briskly. They walk between rows and rows of unsullied.
s04e01	Two Swords	CUT TO: ESSOS village exterior.
s04e01	Two Swords	The crowd bows in reverence as DAENERYS and MISSANDEI stride past.
s04e01	Two Swords	CROWD: Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: How long have they been at it?
s04e01	Two Swords	MISSANDEI: Since midnight, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	They come upon DAARIO NAHARIS and GREY WORM, who sit cross legged facing one another. Each of them holds their arms extended straight before them,  their weapons resting atop. Apparently, this is a game of endurance.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
s04e01	Two Swords	DENERYS: That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS turns to leave, but neither of the men budge.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO and GREY WORM drop their arms simultaneously. Their weapons fall to the sand. DAARIO groans, while MISSANDEI gives GREY WORM a look. DARIO nods to GREY WORM and they both stand.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: (in valerian) You like this girl? Must be frustrating.
s04e01	Two Swords	GREY WORM: (in valerian) You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: (in valerian) I'd rather have no brains and two balls.

s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA does not respond.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: Pigeon pie.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: No, thank you.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE looks back to the table for other options, and picks up SANSA's plate.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: Lemon cakes?
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: No, thank you.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: You love lemon cakes.

s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
s04e01	Two Swords	MAREI leaves, but SHAE stays. TYRION nodes, imploringly.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: She needs to eat.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE exits and TYRION sits at the table with SANSA. He takes her hand.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I can't let you starve.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE looks back in anger.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I swore to protect you.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA looks away and removes her hand from Tyrion's.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: How can you help me?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I don't know, but I can try.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA stands, and TYRION does as well, in politeness.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Of course I haven't forgotten.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: I want you. Don't you want me?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION:  Things are a bit tense right now.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: What things?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: You need to relax.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE takes TYRION's fingers into her mouth to moisten them, then places his hand under her dress.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: Don't you want to relax?
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE tries to kiss him, but TYRION removes his hand in defiance.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE:  What's wrong?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: I told you. It's not a good time.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE:  It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION:  Shae.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: Do you love her?
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION:  Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE:  That's not an answer.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Of course I don't love her.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: You tried to ship me away.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION: Ship you away?
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION:  What in the world are you talking about?
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!
s04e01	Two Swords	TYRION:  Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
s04e01	Two Swords	SHAE: You want me to stay?

s04e01	Two Swords	QYBURN: A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI pours wine in the foreground.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Days?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME moves his metal hand around for effect.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Uh... a hook would be more practical.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Elegant, I think.
s04e01	Two Swords	QYBURN squeeze the hand firmly into place, and JAIME winces. QYBURN starts to depart but CERSEI intercepts him.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSIE: Thank you for your help with the other matter.
s04e01	Two Swords	QYBURN: The symptoms have abated?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.
s04e01	Two Swords	QYBURN: Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.
s04e01	Two Swords	QYBURN turns to JAIME, who waves his fake hand meekly. QYBURN gives CERSEI one last look, and exits.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Odd little man.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI:  I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: What symptoms?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Symptoms that are not your concern.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: You let him touch you?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: You jealous?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: (Laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Well, they smell like Pycelle.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: You drink more than you used to.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Yes.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Why?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: It must have been traumatic for you.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: A rather short siege.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So...
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME sits beside her.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Father disowned me today.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: You're forgetting Tyrion.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME takes her hand.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
s04e01	Two Swords	He moves to kiss her.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Not now.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME:  I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI does not answer.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Something's changed.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: What do you want me to apologize for?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: For leaving me.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI: You took too long.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME:  I... What are you saying?
s04e01	Two Swords	CERSEI:  I'm saying you took too long.

s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND: We wait for Mance's orders.
s04e01	Two Swords	YGRITTE: You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.
s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND: And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.
s04e01	Two Swords	YGRITTE: Yeah, well, he's a liar.
s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND: He is? Shouldn't it be "he was"? You said you put three arrows in him.
s04e01	Two Swords	YGRITTE:  I did.
s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND: I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.

s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND sheathes his sword. The Thenns come closer.

s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND: You came from the south, not the north.
s04e01	Two Swords	WARG: Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
s04e01	Two Swords	A Thenn drops a heavy bag from his shoulder to the floor of the crevice.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND: Help yourself.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: (Chuckles) Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
s04e01	Two Swords	The Thenns pull some bird meat off the spit that was on the fire.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR pats TORMUND on the shoulder as he walks past. TORMUND follows, with YGRITTE further behind.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?
s04e01	Two Swords	TORMUND: I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: She yours?
s04e01	Two Swords	YGRITTE: I'm not anybody's.
s04e01	Two Swords	YGRITTE notches an arrow and places it directly on  STYR's throat. Two of his Thenn companions draw their swords.  STYR stares YGRITTE down.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR turns his attention to TORMUND. YGRITTE lowers her bow a TORMUND's command. The other Thenns continue to work at the fire.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR walks towards the fire.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR: I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.
s04e01	Two Swords	STYR kneels before the fire, where the other Thenns have skewered a human arm on the spit roasting in the fire.

s04e01	Two Swords	JON: I didn't murder him.
s04e01	Two Swords	ALLISER THORNE:  No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: He wanted me to kill him.
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT: A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
s04e01	Two Swords	ALLISER THORNE: Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT: The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT: You admit to breaking your vows, then?
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: I do.
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT: The law is the law. The boy must die.
s04e01	Two Swords	MAESTER AEMON: If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.
s04e01	Two Swords	ALLISER THORNE: There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.
s04e01	Two Swords	ALLISER THORNE:  Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT: (Laughs) Giants?
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLUNT: I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT stands in indignation.
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT: How dare you?!
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
s04e01	Two Swords	JANOS SLYNT sits back down.
s04e01	Two Swords	JON: Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
s04e01	Two Swords	MAESTER AEMON: None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on.
s04e01	Two Swords	JON nods and leaves. MAESTER AEMON stands to leave, frail and helped by his assistant. He moves slowly down the wooden stairs from the dais to the floor.
s04e01	Two Swords	ALLISER THORNE: I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.
s04e01	Two Swords	MAESTER AEMON: Yes, you are.
s04e01	Two Swords	ALLISER THORNE:  And I don't trust the bastard.
s04e01	Two Swords	MAESTER AEMON: He told the truth.

s04e01	Two Swords	MARGAERY: The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLENNA: Nonsense.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLENNA turns to the half dozen maids waiting.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLENNA: My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.
s04e01	Two Swords	The maids exit, laughing. OLENNA turns back to MARGAERY. They sit.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLENNA: The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.
s04e01	Two Swords	MARGAERY: Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.

s04e01	Two Swords	OLENNA turns to MARGAERY, intrigued.
s04e01	Two Swords	OLENNA: You dare not refuse.
s04e01	Two Swords	CUT TO: Another part of the garden.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE and MARGAERY stroll next to a pond
s04e01	Two Swords	MARGAERY: A shadow?
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.
s04e01	Two Swords	MARGAERY: Joffrey is our king now.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE: I meant no offense.
s04e01	Two Swords	MARGAERY: And you've given none.
s04e01	Two Swords	MARGAERY gently touches BRIENNE on the shoulder.
s04e01	Two Swords	INT. King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY, JAIME and MERYN TRANT are strategizing.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY: Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
s04e01	Two Swords	MERYN: I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble.
s04e01	Two Swords	MERYN: The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY: By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY: I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY: Busy getting captured.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY thumbs through a large tome.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: So this is the famous "Book of Brothers"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. (Chuckles) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. (Laughs) Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: So they say.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY: Ser Jaime Lannister. (Chuckles)
s04e01	Two Swords	There is very little written in the Book of Brothers about JAIME.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY: Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME:  There's still time.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY:  Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.
s04e01	Two Swords	JOFFREY and MERYN exit. JAIME walks over to the book, and slams it shut.
s04e01	Two Swords	EXT. ESSOS
s04e01	Two Swords	The unsullied are marching past DAENERYS and MISSANDEI, who stand on a cliff overlooking the shore.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: Have you ever been to Meereen?
s04e01	Two Swords	MISSANDEI: Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: And?
s04e01	Two Swords	MISSANDEI: They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
s04e01	Two Swords	MISSANDEI:  If they're smart, Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	Footsteps approach, and DAARIO NAHARIS enters.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: You were told to ride at the back of the train.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS signals for MISSANDEI to leave them.
s04e01	Two Swords	MISSANDEI: Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	MISSANDEI exists.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: All right, what is this matter of strategy?
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO presents DAENERYS with a purple flower.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: A dusk rose.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS starts to walk away, but DAARIO follows and presents her with another small flowering plant, this one is white.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: And this one's called lady's lace.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: Would you like to walk without shoes?
s04e01	Two Swords	DAAERIO: You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO presents her with a red flower.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO presents the three flowers to DAENERYS in a small bouquet.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: You are a gambler, aren't you?
s04e01	Two Swords	She takes the flowers. DAARIO makes a small bow to depart.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAARIO: Your Grace.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS ponders. A man shouts in valerian. She joins, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH, GREY WORM and MISSANDEI. They have found a mile marker, festooned by a woman's corpse who points the way to Mereen.s
s04e01	Two Swords	JORAH: There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
s04e01	Two Swords	BARRISTAN: 163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this.
s04e01	Two Swords	DAENERYS: You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
s04e01	Two Swords	EXT.  KING'S LANDING.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA stands on the shore with eyes closed. BRIENNE and JAIME stand on the cliff above.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE: There she is.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Yes, there she is.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE: And? You made a promise.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE: To keep them safe.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE: A complication does not release you from a vow.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
s04e01	Two Swords	BRIENNE: Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME: Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.
s04e01	Two Swords	JAIME exits. BRIENNE follows.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA comes up from the shore. She hears something, and realizes that she is not alone. She quickens her pace through the woods. A man trails her, stealthily. She speeds her walk, and comes to a table. TOMMY taps her on the shoulder. She starts.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS:  It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA:  You're drunk.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS: Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS: I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: Anyone would have done the same.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS: But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS gives SANSA a necklace with blue stones. SANSA looks closely at it.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS: It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS: I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
s04e01	Two Swords	SANSA: I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.
s04e01	Two Swords	SER DONTOS: Yeah.
s04e01	Two Swords	They both smile
s04e01	Two Swords	EXT. THE RIVERLANDS
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA sits in front of the HOUND on his horse. They ride through a scene of brutal violence, with villagers slaughtered amongst their upended carts. Flies buzz at the corpses.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: When am I going to get a horse of my own?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: The little lady wants a pony.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: The little lady wants away from your stench.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: No.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: You're not very smart, are you?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: I'm not a thief.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: A man's got to have a code.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.
s04e01	Two Swords	CUT TO: outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: I'm hungry. You're hungry.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.
s04e01	Two Swords	Two men exit the bulding, and ARYA recognizes POLLIVER.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
s04e01	Two Swords	The two men urinate into the bushes by the farm.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: He killed Lommy.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: What the fuck's a Lommy?
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Got what?
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: My sword Needle.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND:  Needle? Of course you named your sword.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: Lots of people name their swords.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Lots of cunts.
s04e01	Two Swords	The two men finish relieving themselves and return inside. The HOUND notices that ARYA has started towards the Inn.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: What are you... get back here.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: My brother gave me that sword.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND:  Get back here.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA:  He killed my friend.
s04e01	Two Swords	The HOUND grabs ARYA roughly by the should and puts himself between her and the door.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.
s04e01	Two Swords	The door opens behind him and a soldier meets his eye. The HOUND turns to face him fully. He retreats, allowing the HOUND to enter.
s04e01	Two Swords	CUT TO: FARMHOUSE INTERIOR
s04e01	Two Swords	The HOUND enters the door, and a woman can be heard whimpering while the soldiers egg each other on.
s04e01	Two Swords	MAN: Come on, give it up.
s04e01	Two Swords	INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER: (Whimpers)
s04e01	Two Swords	MAN: Come here.
s04e01	Two Swords	INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER: (Whimpers)
s04e01	Two Swords	MAN: Let's have a feel there.
s04e01	Two Swords	MAN #2: Leave it.
s04e01	Two Swords	The INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER struggles in the grasp of one of the men ARYA enters behind the hound and shuts the door. The soldiers look warily at their the duo. Everyone goes quiet as the HOUND and ARYA enter the inn. The HOUND and ARYA sit at a table in the back. The men return to their assault on the girl.
s04e01	Two Swords	MAN: Come here.
s04e01	Two Swords	INNKEEPER: Please, she's a good girl.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER turns to look at ARYA . He recognizes her.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: I know you.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA graps the hilt of the HOUND's sword. POLLIVER stnads.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: You're the Hound.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA is relieved. She releases her grip on the HOUND's sword. POLLIVER walks over and joins their table.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: Just keeping the king's peace.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: No need. The war's over.
s04e01	Two Swords	The INNKEEPER pours them some ale. The HOUND drinks.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: None taken.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun? (Chuckles)
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER turns to look at ARYA.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: But I don't need to tell you that, eh?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: She's all right. I've had better.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: (Laughs) You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: I'm not going to King's Landing.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Fuck the king.
s04e01	Two Swords	The chatter in the inn stops.The HOUND takes a drink.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: You got money to pay for it?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: You paid for it?
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: (Laughs) No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Not a penny.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: I'll still take that chicken.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
s04e01	Two Swords	The men chuckle.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
s04e01	Two Swords	The HOUND takes POLLIVER's ale, and finishes it in one long drink.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: You don't seem to understand the situation.
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
s04e01	Two Swords	HOUND: Someone is.
s04e01	Two Swords	The men stare one another down. POLLIVER rises to attack, but the HOUND turns over the table, knocking him down. He then sets to the room and dispatches the soldiers one by one, while the INNKEEPER cowers. The fight is brutal, using both sword and fist. POLLIVER and a companion. are able to get the upper hand, and the HOUND falls to the ground, where they kick at him violently. ARYA watches in fright. The HOUND manages to fend them off with his sword, even from the ground. He sweeps the legs out from under one of them, and POLLIVER scambles on all fours towards his sword. The HOUND steps on the blade and slugs POLLIVER violently, who crumples to the ground. The fight continues, and the HOUND gores another soldier before TOMMY pins the HOUND to the ground, a dagger to his throat. With great strength, the HOUND pulls the man's dagger away from his throat while gouging at his face. He positions the man's face over his own dagger, and swiftly slams the soldier's face into the dagger, repeatedly.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA moves from shock into action. She shatters a jug over a soldier's head, then picks up a sword and stabs him through, slowly. She comes up behind POLLIVER, who is stalking the wounded HOUND, and stabs him through. She takes need from him before he falls forward to the ground. The HOUND runs another soldier through. ARYA walks calmly over POLLIVER, who lays on his back.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: Something wrong with your leg, boy?
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: What? What do you mean?
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
s04e01	Two Swords	POLLIVER: Carry me?
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: Fine little blade.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA puts the point of her blade under POLLIVER's chin. He raises his hands weakly in surrender.
s04e01	Two Swords	ARYA: Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
s04e01	Two Swords	A light of recognition fills POLLIVER's eyes, met quickly by ARYA stabbing him through the chin, slowly. He gasps and gurgles. She removes her sword and watches the blood fill his mouth. He chokes, spurts, and dies.
s04e01	Two Swords	EXT. Outside the inn
s04e01	Two Swords	The HOUND rides his mount, chewing on some chicken. ARYA comes into view behind him on her own white horse. She looks pleased. They ride through the devastation of the countryside.

s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Dogs bark and a woman laughs. Another woman breathes in panic, gasping for breath
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Ramsay: Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY and MYRANDA run together, holding hands. They each hold a bow as they run.  They are happy, excited and enjoying themselves. THEON limps behind them, trying to keep up. The hunting dogs continue to bark.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Tansy! Tansy!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TANSY runs through the woods, the hunting dogs barking in pursuit. Further behind are RAMSAY, MYRANDA and THEON.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: There you are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TANSAY: (screams)
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA: (laughing) I can't see her, Ramsay.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Tansy!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY notches an arrow. TANSY pauses at a tree, gasping for breath. RAMSAY's arrow strikes the tree, just inches from her face. She screams, and begins running again.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA expertly notches an arrow and lets it fly. It flies past TANSY, who stumbles down into a muddy stream, gasping and screaming. She scrambles on all fours in panic, pauses to hide in the shadowed stream bed. She sobs.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Tansy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA: Where is she?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The hunting dogs come barreling down the stream bed towards TANSY. She shrieks and whimpers, and starts running once again. The dogs chase her through a small tunnel and back into the woods proper. MYRANDA lets another arrow fly, with concentration and precision. It hits TANSY in the leg, and she falls, sobbing. The dogs terrorize her. RAMSAY, MYRANDA and THEON catch up.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA:  I only wounded her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY:  You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON: A fine shot, master. My lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TANSY: Please, my lord. It hurts.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA notches another arrow at takes aim.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA: She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TANSY: Why? I did whatever you asked.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: But you made Myranda feel jealous.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA lowers her bow, a bit taken aback.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MYRANDA:  Me jealous of her?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TANSY: My lord, please.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY turns from jaunty to ferocious.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Off camera, the dogs tear into TANSY. She screams. THEON watches, dejected and powerless. Sounds of ripping flesh and TANSY screaming fill the woods.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Not so pretty now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TANSY's screams have stopped, but the sounds of ripping flesh continue. THEON struggles to hold back tears.

s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PODRICK: Is it solid gold?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Gilded steel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: I'm not hungry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION raises his cup.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME moves to raise his own cup, but knocks it over clumsily with his left hand.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME:  Oh!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PODRICK: I'll clean it up.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: No, I'll do it. Leave us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PODRICK exits, while JAIME places his cup right-side up.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: It's only wine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	He holds up his own cup and pours it out onto the table. JAIME sits back in resignation. TYRION stands and pours more wine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: I can't fight anymore.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: What about your left?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION sits back down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN appears, carrying some swords. He joins JAIME, who sits by the shore.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Is this place safe?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME tosses a pouch of gold to BRONN.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Uh-huh.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN pockets the gold. JAIME gets his sword, and spins it in his wrist to warm it. BRONN whistles in admiration.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN stands, holding two sparring swords.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	He drops one to the ground, clattering, and continues to walk forward.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME walks to the sparring sword, indignant. He reaches for it, but BRONN slaps his hand with his sword, just as he grabs it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: Best time to attack a man.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN swings at JAIME, who parries clumsily. BRONN pushes him, and JAIME falters to the wall.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: Mind yourself. JAIME;  If I still had my right hand...
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN:  Plan on growing it back?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	They engage in swordplay. JAIME parries defensively, but well. However, BRONN gets him off balance again and causes him to stumble with a forearm nudge. JAIME recovers and faces him. JAIME pants and resets.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Come on, then.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME makes an awkward attack, and they continue.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: DREADFORT, NIGHT
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Some riders gallops down the Dreadfort road,
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAN: Open the gates!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: DREADFORT COURTYARD
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The men swing open the door and the riders enter.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAN: Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY stands to greet the riders. ROOSE BOLTON and WALDA dismount and approach.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Father. Welcome home.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSEY steps forward to greet her, warmly smiling.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: A pleasure, Mother.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY kisses her cheek. WALDA smiles awkwardly.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	WALDA: Hello.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	WOMAN: This way, my lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	WALDA and the WOMAN exit.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: Where is your prize?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE exits, and RAMSAY greets LOCKE. They walk together.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LOCKE: Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: (laughs)
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CUT TO: DREADFORT INTERIOR
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE sits down by the fire, aching and exhausted from the ride. RAMSAY and THEON enter. A man stands in the background, sharpening a shaving razor against a strop.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Father.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE rises to inspect THEON.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: What did you do to him?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: You flayed him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: I placed far too much trust in you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON:  I'm sorry, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY:  Give him the razor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY sits.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON takes the razor and the shaving cream.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Go on, Reek. A nice close shave.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON lathers RAMSAY's face and begins to shave it carefully.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON: I don't know, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON: No, my lord. Just two farm boys.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: And crisped them so no one would know.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON: Yes, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON continues to shave RAMSAY and holds the razor on RAMSAY's throat. RAMSAY goads him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON's hand twitches, and he struggles with himself. Then he continues to shave RAMSAY slowly.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: You ready for a hunt?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MERYN TRANT: Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LOCKE: Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THEON: Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LOCKE: Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSEY stands, cleanly shaven.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RAMSAY: Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROOSE: You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION and PODRICK meet VARYS.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	VARYS: I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Oh, to be foreign.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	VARYS: Ahem.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PODRICK stands aside as TYRION and VARYS head down a more secluded path.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	VARYS: Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	VARYS: No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION:  Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	VARYS: No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	VARYS: Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	VARYS bows and leaves. TYRION fumes.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: A GARDEN PARTY
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SANSA, TYRION, JOFFREY, TYWIN, CERSEI, TOMMEN, and PYCELLE sit at an outdoor banquet table. MACE TYRELL stands before them.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MACE: From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	He places the up before JOFFREY.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MACE: May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MACE: I shall be honored, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MACE bows and exits. SHAE brings a tray to the table and sets it before SANSA.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE exits.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION looks concerned. PODRICK places a large tome before JOFFREY and TYRION walks to the front of the table
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: A book?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION:  "The Lives of Four Kings." Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY is at a loss for words. TYWIN entreats him to respond.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION bows. SHAE watches. THE MOUNTAIN brings forth a sword and lays it on the table before JOFFREY. TYWIN stands.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Excitedly, JOFFREY walks around the table. Exuberantly, he unsheaths the sword.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE: Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: So they say.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY steps away, then spins and cleaves the book that TYRION just gave him, repeatedly. People gasp in response. JOFFREY is very pleased.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAN: Stormbringer.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAN #2: Terminus.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAN #3: Widow's Wail.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAN #4: Wolfsbane.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY sheaths the sword. SANSA looks dejected. He sits down next to MACE and SHAE continues to look on.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	INT: TYRION'S CHAMBERS
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The door opens and SHAE walks in, smiling.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Don't.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Don't call me that.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: What should I call you?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: Our friendship?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: What?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: What is this?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: She doesn't want you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION:  I need to do right by her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: You don't want her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION:  By our children.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: What are you afraid of?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION:  I'm not afraid.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: I need you to leave.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Shae.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE: How many whores have you been with?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION walks over and opens the door. SHAE sobs. BRONN enters.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHAE continues to sob. BRONN clasps her shoulder to lead her out. She turns quickly and slaps him, then storms off, crying. BRONN looks to TYRION, then exits. TYRION walks to the table and violently slaps his cup to the ground.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	A woman screams. A line of men are bound on top of unlit bonfires, including AXELL FLORENT. The soldiers mill about, carrying torches.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	AXELL FLORENT: Sire, I served you well.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The crowd chants along with MELISANDRE.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, show us the way...
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	AXELL FLORENT: Selyse, you're my sister!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: (Chanting with the others) Yours are the stars that guide us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	AXELL FLORENT: Tell him! Tell him!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The bonfires ignite quickly. The men scream in agony and die.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: (to STANNIS) Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS leaves without responding. DAVOS trails him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	DAVOS: Lord Florent was your brother by law.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS; He was an infidel.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	DAVOS: He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS: I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	DAVOS: How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS: A good deal more than you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS exits and SELYSE catches up, accompanied by MELISANDRE.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	DAVOS: I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE walks past DAVOS and he watches, silently.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	INT: STORM'S END DINING ROOM
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Stannis sits at table with SELYSE and MELISANDRE.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS: Meat's off.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: Our larders are almost empty.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS: Serve fish, then. We're on an island.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: You hate fish.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS: I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: (to MELISANDRE) When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS: Of course I remember.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: It's all I knew when I was a child.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: Until you found the Lord of Light?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Until he found me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: I fear for our daughter's soul.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Every mother should fear for her child's soul.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: She's a stubborn little beast.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS:  She's a child.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS: She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SELYSE: As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	INT: SHIREEN'S BEDROOM
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	A knock on the door.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: Come in.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE enters.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Were you sleeping, Princess?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: (shakes her head)
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE:  Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: I heard it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: And it frightened you?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: But they screamed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: And you didn't have this.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: I read "The Seven-Pointed Star."
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE sits next to SHIREEN to comfort her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SHIREEN: There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MELISANDRE: There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: THE NORTH, NIGHT
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Heavy breathing as the camera pans through the snowy woods. Suddenly, the camera lurches forward and comes upon a deer and the camera attacks viciously, a wolf's hunt from the predator's point of view.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Hodor: Hodor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Bran is suddenly awakened. HODOR, MEERA, and JOJEN are with him. BRAN is frantic and panting.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN: Why did you wake me?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MEERA: You've been gone for hours.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN: I was hungry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MEERA: We're all hungry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN: I was just eating.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOJEN: Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN eats some morsels given to him by MEERA.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOJEN: Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MEERA: You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: THE NORTH
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	HODOR pulls BRAN through the woods on a sled. MEERA and JOJEN walk beside them. A wolf barks. They pause and BRAN turns to see his wolf, Summer.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN: Hodor, take me to the tree.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	HODOR carries BRAN to the base of the tree, sets him down and steps back. The bark seems to have twisted into a human face. BRAN touches it and launches into a vision of the Godswood, a THREE-EYED RAVEN, a sword, NED STARK's worried face, the Godswood again. Time speeds forward.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THREE-EYED RAVEN: Look for me... beneath the tree.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The THREE-EYED RAVEN lands on the branch of a Godswood. A storm of crows flies into a standing BRAN. A castle interior, an undead horse,
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: He saw us.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN falls from the Winterfell tower. A dragon's shadow sweeps over King's Landing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	THREE-EYED RAVEN: North.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN gasps and releases his hand from the twisted face on the tree. The vision has ended. MEERA and JOJEN approach.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRAN: I know where we have to go.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	INT: KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY and MACE walk down the aisle. MACE hands her to JOFFREY. The pair continue up the steps to the HIGH SEPTON. He places a cape over her shoulders. They clasp hands and they bar bound together.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	HIGH SEPTON: Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: With this kiss, I pledge my love.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY and MARGAERY kiss. The crowd applauds.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SANSA: We have a new queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Better her than you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	EXT: KING'S LANDING GARDEN
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN and OLENNA talk in the garden as the wedding guests filter out.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: Bit much, wouldn't you say?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA:  It feels proportionate.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN:  Proportionate to what?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: The expected extravagance.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MACE approaches and ties to join them.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN and OLENNA continue, while MACE rears back.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. "The Iron Bank will have it's due." How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CUT TO: THE WEDDING RECEPTION
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Jugglers and fire-breathers, some on stilts, entertain the crowd. BRONN, TYRION, and PODRICK walk among the tables.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: All taken care of.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You saw her board the ship?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: Aye, she's on it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: You saw the ship sail away?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: How do you know?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: There's someone following you?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN turns and clasps TYRION's shoulder.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN: She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRONN exits.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION and PODRICK walk through the party. They encounter OBERYN and ELLARIA.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: Hello.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Hello.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: Not you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN and ELLARIA are enthralled by a contortionist. TYRION and PODRICK walk on.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CUT TO: THE HEAD TABLE
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY watches the party. OLENNA approaches SANSA.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION enters and sits.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: My lady. My lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MUSICIAN: A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine,  my lord...
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY is enjoying the performance, but JOFFREY is bored. He stands and throws some coins to them.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Very good. Very good. Off you go.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The musicians scrabble to pick up the coins, and depart quickly. MARGAERY moves to calm JOFFREY. CERSEI watches jealously, TOMMEN at her side.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY; My love, why don't we make the announcement?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY stands and clanks his goblet for attention.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The crowd applauds as JOFFREY sits and MARGAERY stands.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY: We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The crowd applauds, and JOFFREY adores it. CERSEI comes over to MARGAERY.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: You're an example to us all.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI kisses her on each cheek.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LORAS stands in the distance, and catches OBERYN's eye as he cuddles with ELLARIA. LORAS accidentally backs into JAIME.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LORAS: Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LORAS: As does yours.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: So, looking forward to your wedding?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LORAS: Yes, very much.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LORAS: They certainly are.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LORAS: And neither will you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	LORAS pats JAIME on the shoulder, and exits. BRIENNE approaches the head table, and bows.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE: Your Grace. My king. My queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY stands and shakes her hand.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY:  Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE: I'm no lady, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Did you just bow?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE: Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY: That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE:  I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Yes, yes.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY: Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE departs, and the camera follows her. CERSEI intercepts her.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE: As you say, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE: In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE:  Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE: I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: But you love him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BREINNE does not answer.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE: Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BRIENNE exits, and JAIME notices their conversation.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CUT TO: THE HEAD TABLE
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE has cornered a maid.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE: No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI:  She'll do no such thing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE: Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice...
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAID: Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The MAID exits.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE:  Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE: Your Grace, I am a man of learning.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE: I never meant to annoy anyone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE: Your Grace, Queen Margaery-
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PYCELLE exits, and CERSEI smiles.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CUT TO: THE HEAD TABLE
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY and MARGAERY watch a fool juggling. Once again, JOFFREY is not amused. He stands.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The fool is suddenly pelted with food, and he runs off. CERSEI and TYWIN enter.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: You're in rather a good mood.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: I suppose I am.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: I won't ask why.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Small pleasures.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN and ELLARIA enter.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: Prince Oberyn.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ELLARIA:  My lord. My lady.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: Charmed.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ELLARIA: We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: No? How tolerant of you.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYWIN: Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OBERYN: People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY taps his goblet.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies...
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	A lever is pulled. A giant lion's mouth opens. A red carpet rolls down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Five dwarves come down from the lion's mouth, each dressed as one of the five kings. They run about, playing their roles with comic glee. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY is very pleased. TYRION, less so.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RENLY DWARF: I'm the rightful king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROBB DWARF: King in the North!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: Yes!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BALON DWARF: Traitor. You're a traitor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: For the Seven Kingdoms!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The dwarves line up on the stage.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: Let the war begin.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The crowd applauds. RENLY DWARF starts the prance about the stage.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS DWARF: Renly, you're no king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BALON DWARF: Away, degenerate. Away. Away.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RENLY DWARF: Ooh, careful.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS DWARF:  Go on.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	RENLY DWARF: I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS DWARF and RENLY DWARF feign some indecent acts. LORAS leaves in disgust.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BALON DWARF: Who's got the gold now, Stark?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROBB DWARF: I am the rightful king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BALON DWARF: Challenge me, ruffian.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROBB DWARF: Take that.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	BALON DWARF:  I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROBB DWARF: I am the King in the North!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION and SANSA are not amused.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF shoots and arrow and hits STANNIS DWARF.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	STANNIS DWARF: Not wildfire!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The crowd applauds. STANNIS DWARF runs off the stage, crying.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRON: Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	PODRICK: Yes, my lord.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY is enjoying the spectacle, but MARGAERY is not.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF and ROBB DWARF are having a stand off.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: Charge!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	They run past one another without landing a blow.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: Ready, again.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROBB DWARF:  I am the King in the North! - Charge!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: Charge! Yes!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	This time, JOFFREY DWARD knocks off ROBB DWARF's wolf helmet.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: Your head!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SANSA is mortified. JOFFREY laughs hysterically while MARGAERY looks at him, appalled.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	ROBB DWARF falls. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY DWARF claims victory.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY grabs his goblet.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF feigns sodomizing the wolf head. SANSA is motionless. JOFFREY spits out his wine, laughing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY DWARF: Fine gentlemen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The players take their bow and the crowd applauds. JOFFREY stands.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The crowd laughs. TYRION stands.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION sits, and JOFFREY is angered at his insults. The crowd quiets. JOFFREY walks over and pours his wine on TYRION's head. MARGAERY sits motionless.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: It did not spill.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY: My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Your Grace does me a great honor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: (miffed) It's not meant as an honor.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION stands and walks over to JOFFREY, who purposely drops his goblet. As TYRION tried to pick it up, he kicks it away.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Bring me my goblet.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION kneels down to get the goblet. SANSA watches JOFFREY. She picks up the goblet and hands it to TYRION. He brings it to JOFFREY.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION pours wine for JOFFREY in front of CERSEI, and hands it to him.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Kneel. Kneel before your king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION does not budge.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Kneel. I said... kneel!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY: (Standing) Look, the pie.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The crowd applauds, and the attention turns to the giant pie carried in by four men.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: My queen.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY strides forward, and hews the pie with his sword. To his surprise, doves are released from the pie. He looks triumphant.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY: Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The pie is served to the guests.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SANSA: Can we leave now?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Let's find out.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY feeds a forkful of pie to JOFFREY.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION looks to SANSA.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Well, hurry up. This pie is dry.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION and fumes has he gets the goblet for JOFFREY. JOFFREY drinks deeply.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: Mm, good. Needs washing down.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: No. (coughing) No, you'll wait here... un...
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY grabs his own throat, choking.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION: Your Grace?
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: It's nothing.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MARGAERY: He's choking!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: Help the poor boy.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY turns towards the crowd, choking and staggering.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	OLENNA: Idiots, help your king.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Move away!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME runs to JOFFREY, as he vomits.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JAIME: Joffrey! Joffrey!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI runs to them.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI:  Help him! Someone help him!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY: (gags)
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Joffrey!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SER DONTOS: (to SANSA) Come with me now.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Joffrey! Joffrey!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	TYRION and MARGAERY watch, aghast. CERSEI and JAIME continue to try to help JOFFREY.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	SER DONTOS: If you want to live, we have to leave.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Don't touch him!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	JOFFREY gurgles and chokes. His face is turning purple, his eyes glazed, vomit lining his cheeks. He spasms.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Blood streams out of JOFFREY's nose. He convulses painfully. CERSEI cries as she watches him. He reaches a hand out towards TYRION, who at that moment picks up the goblet from before him. JOFFREY gaps a final time as blood continues to stream from his nose, his face a horrid shade of purple. He dies.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: My son.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	MAN: He's gone. Our king is gone.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	CERSEI: He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	Two guards grab TYRION. CERSEI looks upon the lifeless body of JOFFREY.
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	From HBO:
s04e02	The Lion and the Rose	The Lannisters and their guests gather in King’s Landing.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT. KING'S LANDING
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The wedding banquet for Margaery and Joffrey has turned shocking and horrific. Joffrey lays dead in his mother's lap. Blood pours from his nose and vomit clings around his mouth. Cersei turns to Tyrion.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: You did this. You did this!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Three guards grab Tyrion from behind. As Sansa looks on, Ser Dontos Hollard approaches her.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: We have to leave.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Take him! Take him!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Tyrion is dragged off by guards as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush off through the crowd.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Where is she?!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: No one leaves the capital! No one!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT. KINGS LANDING DOCK AT DUSK
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	A bell tolls as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush down to a small boat, separate from the Harbor.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: Get in.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: Where are we going?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: Somewhere safe.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Sansa and Ser Dontos sail out into the ocean, far from King's Landing.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT. MISTY OCEAN AT NIGHT
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	They come across a huge mysterious ship in the middle of the misty sea. Ser Dontos pulls his smaller boat up alongside it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Sansa climbs the latter.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT. LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	She climbs up a ladder on the side of the ship, as she reaches the top someone grabs her. She gasps before realizing who it is.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: Lord Baelish?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: (shakes her head.)
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.  LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: 10,000.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Littlefinger clicks his finger and two men with crossbows walk to the edge of the ship. They aim at Ser Dontos.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SER DONTOS: Wait!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Both men shoot at Ser Dontos, he groans in pain before lying dead. Sansa screams and Littlefinger hushes her.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: I didn't murder anyone.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Sansa glances back to Ser Dontos' body.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: Why did you kill him?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: He saved me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: He was helping me because I saved his life.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Littlefinger removes the necklace from around Sansa's neck and places it on the edge of the ship. He pull out a knife and hits one of the "crystals" and it smashes like glass. Sansa, confused, studies him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SANSA: We're all liars here.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Littlefinger pushes the necklace off the edge of the boat and it lands directly on Ser Dontos' lifeless body.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	LITTLEFINGER: Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CUT TO: EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Margaery Tyrell sits at the table with Olenna Tyrell.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MARGAERY: So am I the queen?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLENNA: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MARGAERY: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLENNA: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MARGAERY: What was it like?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLENNA: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MARGAERY: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLENNA: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MARGAERY: But I would have been the queen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLENNA: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CUT TO: INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Joffrey's body is laid on a table in the center on the room. Cersei, Tommen and Tywin and stand around him. Tywin turns to Tommen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Tommen stays quiet.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: I'm not trying to trick you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: It means I'll become king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: A good king?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: This is hardly the place or the time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: Holiness?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: Justice.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: What about strength?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: Wisdom.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Yes!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: Wisdom is what makes a good king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Tywin and Tommen begin walking up the steps to leave the Sept.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: A king needs a queen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: Yes.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN: I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME enters.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: How are you?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TOMMEN:  I'm all right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME:You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN and TOMMEN exit.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HIGH SEPTON: Yes, my lord. All of you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The High Septon snaps his fingers and the priests exit.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. "A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth." That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: I don't know what I saw.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME consoles CERSEI. They kiss. CERSEI steps back and gasps.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME grabs CERSEI and forcefully kisses her. He presses against her.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Jaime, not here, please. Please.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME rips at her dress. They end up tangled on the floor by the altar.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: No.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Stop it. Stop.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	She continues to resist, but her resolve is weakening. They kiss, and JAIME brings her to the ground and forces himself on her.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Stop.  Stop. It's not right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: (GRUNTS)
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: It's not right. It's not right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME:  I don't care.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: (CRYING)  Don't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: I don't care.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CERSEI: Don't. Jaime, don't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JAIME: I don't care.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT: RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Thunder rumbles as the HOUND relieves himself and ARYA plucks the leaves from a plant.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Near Fairmarket, I think.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: You think? You don't have a map?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: No, I don't have a map.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: Maybe we should get one.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: How far is it to the Eyrie?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Far.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: And you're sure we're going the right way?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The HOUND feed his mount some water.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: On your way where?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND:  Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: I'd like to see Braavos one day.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Why Braavos?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: I have friends there.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND:  I doubt it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: Seven blessings to you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET and SALLY sit in their wagon above them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND:  What do you want?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: What do I want? This is my land.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND:  If I'm standing on it, it's my land.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: (nods)
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: He's never been the same.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: Which house did he fight for?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: The Tullys of Riverrun.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CUT TO: FARMER'S HOME.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Thunder rumbles and the rain patters. FARMER HAMLET and SALLY host ARYA and the HOUND for dinner.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: Father!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The HOUND impatiently grabs the pot and pours himself some soup.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: I'm so sorry.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The HOUND and ARYA slurp hungrily. FARMER HAMLET and SALLY watch, a bit appalled at their manners.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: Really good.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: Did you fight at the Twins?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Guest right don't mean much anymore.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET: It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: You got any ale?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET:  Afraid not.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: How can a man not keep ale in his home?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	FARMER HAMLET:  You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: (Nods) Fair wages for fair work.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	INT. BARN - EARLY MORNING
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Chickens cluck as ARYA sleeps in the hay. Faint voices argue. A punch lands, a man groans and a girl screams.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT: BARN
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA leaves the barn and strides towards the HOUND, FARMER HAMLET and SALLY. The farmer lies on the ground and SALLY tends him. The HOUND has taken something and is walking away.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: What did you do?!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND:  Get your horse saddled.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: You told me you weren't a thief.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: I wasn't.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: He took us in. He fed us and you...
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: You don't know that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ARYA: You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	HOUND: There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT- CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Two rangers walk through the courtyard, taking account of the new recruits.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	RANGER: Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM passes them and encounters ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT at the stairwell.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ALLISER THORNE: There he is, Sam the Slayer.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JANOS SLYNT: Going to visit your wildling whore?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: She's not a whore.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JANOS SLYNT: No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: About what?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: Killing the white Walker.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY:  You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY touches LITTLE SAM.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY:  A what?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: Well, a wildling.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: My father hated that word.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: It's not a very nice word, I suppose.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY:  I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM sits next to her to help with the plucking.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: Why do you worry about it?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: 100 men, one woman.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: They've got other things to think about.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: That's the only thing they think about.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: You're being silly.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM:  I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: What about you?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY:  Thank you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: For what?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: For worrying about me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: So what are you saying?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY: Are you bored of me?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GILLY:  I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS stands looking at the storm. DAVOS enters.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: Your Grace.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS: You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS picks up a scroll and struggles to read it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: Joffrey?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS: The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night...
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS: What progress have you made?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	While DAVOS names houses, STANNIS picks up pieces from the war table, snaps them and discards them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS: House Peasebury.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: House Musgood.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS:  House Musgood.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: And House Haigh.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS: House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS:  The Golden Company?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: They've never broken a contract.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS: They're sellswords.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS: We don't have any gold.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: Not yet.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	STANNIS:  If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS knocks and enters.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: You're late.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: I'm sorry, Princess.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: I thought you weren't coming.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say "ka-nigit."
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS sits and takes up a book to practice reading.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN:  You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: "The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos."
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN claps.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: Thank you very much.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: What's the difference?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: My father says a criminal is a criminal.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: You've sailed to Braavos?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS:  Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS has an inspired thought. He gets up, paces and then kisses SHIREEN on the forehead.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN:  What was that for?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS:  I need you to write a message.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	He hands her a quill and scroll. She begins to write.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SHIREEN: But that's not you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAVOS: I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: North of here? You a fucking wildling?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: Only room and board?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: Could find other work for her, too.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: No other work.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	SAM: You have to trust me. It's for the best.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ELLARIA kissed OLYVAR deeply, but he does not return her ardor.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ELLARIA: No?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLYVAR: I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ELLARIA: That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Your loss.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN takes a drink.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLYVAR: You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Does that surprise you?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLYVAR: Everyone has a preference.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLYVAR: I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: What are you, 25?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ELLARIA: Children.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN:  (CHUCKLES) Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OLYVAR: Did you?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ELLARIA: He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: No, thank you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN dresses and pours some wine.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN:  I'm sorry about your grandson.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Are you?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Which way is that?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Some believe the king choked.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: I did. This is why I know.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: You think we conspired together?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: What did you discuss?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: The death of my sister.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: For which you blame me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Categorically.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: I would like to speak with the Mountain.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: I could arrange for this meeting.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: But you want something in return.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Why?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	OBERYN: You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYWIN: We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: A noble effort.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: I've heard nothing, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: No, my lord. You didn't?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: Your father.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Of course.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: Mace Tyrell.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: My lord, she's gone.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Gone?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: Yes, my lord?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: They'll be following you now.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: Who will?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: Any other witnesses, my lord?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Why not?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: I'll ask, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK stands to go, but hesitates.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: I didn't tell them anything, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Are you going to accept their offer?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: My lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: You've been good to me, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: I already gave them an answer, my lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: My lord.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	TYRION: Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PODRICK: Farewell, my lord.

s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ALLISER THORN: By what?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GRENN: Chains.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DOLOROUS EDD: We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JON: And the mutineers stayed?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DOLOROUS EDD: They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JON: We need to ride north and kill them all.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	ALLISER THORN: We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JON:  It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	PYP: I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	EXT: ESSOS
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The unsullied march towards Meereen. DAENERYS, JORAH, SER BARRISTAN, MISSANDEI and DAARIO NAHARYS ride alongside. The riders dismount at the main gate while the unsullied stand at attention. The Meereen  citifolk watch from atop the walls.murmuring. The main door opens.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: Are they attacking?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JORAH: A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	A single rider advances, and the crowd cheers. He halts horse to the side of DAENERYS's band. He dismounts.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CHAMPION:  (SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: What is he doing?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	BARRISTAN SELMY: I believe he means to...
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The CHAMPION urinates towards DAENERYS. The crowd laughs and cheers.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MISSANDEI: He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	BARRISTAN SELMY: Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JORAH: They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	CHAMPION: (CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	GREY WORM: (SPEAKING VALYRIAN) Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAEYNERYS: (valyrian) You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	BARRISTAN SELMY: Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: Which is why you must remain by my side.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	JORAH: I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAARIO: I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	MISSANDEI: He is very brave, Your Grace.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	A squire helps the mounted CHAMPION arm himself. DAENERYS walks up to DAARIO.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: You sure you don't want a horse?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAARIO: Why would I want a horse?
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: Horses are faster than men.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAARIO: Horses are dumber than men.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS steps back and the CHAMPION charges. DAARIO turns to wink at DAENERYS. The CHAMPION closes in and DAARIO draws his dagger, holds it on his shoulder and kisses it. He then launches it at the charging CHAMPION, burying the blade in his horse's forehead. The horse falls in the sand, the CHAMPION rolling away. As he rises, DAARIO dispatches him with a single blow to the neck. He nods to DAENERYS.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The Meeren crowd is shocked. An order is given, and scores of archers on the wall fire at DAENERYS's band. The arrows plant in front of them. DAARIO urinates in response. DAENERYS paces and the Unsullied turn at attention.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: (valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The crowd quiets.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: (valyrian) Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The Meereen inhabitants start to move away from the wall, while the Meereen soldiers face outside the wall. The Meereen slaves listen carefully to DAENERYS, while their masters become uncomfortable.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The Unsullied move the seige weapons forward. The slaves are emboldened and the inhabitants are taken aback.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	DAENERYS: Fire!
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	The unsullied fire the catapults. Cylindrical logs spin through the air and shatter on the sides of buildings, raining down the empty manacles inside. Civilians and slaves duck as the contents fall among them. A SLAVE picks up an empty choker and looks back at his fearful master.
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	From HBO:
s04e03	Breaker of Chains	Tyrion considers his options; Tywin extends an olive branch; Sam questions the safety of Castle Black; Jon proposes a plan; the Hound teaches Arya; Dany chooses her champion.

s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI is teaching GREY WORM how to read by a fire.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer "Ills."
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI: Isles. Summer Isles.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: Summer Isles. (speaks Valyrian)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI: (speaks Valyrian) I am from an island called Naath.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: (speaks Valyrian) When they took you?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI: "When did they take me?" I was five years old.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: You remember your home?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI: I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: (Shakes his head.) Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI: That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: I don't want return. (Speaks Valyrian.)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI: Kill the masters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: Kill the masters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS and BARRISTAN SELMY enter. They stand
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS: How are the lessons coming?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MISSANDEI: Very well, Your Grace.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: Missandei is teacher good, my queen.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS:  You'll have to continue later. It's time.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS and BARRISTAN SELMY exit, followed by GREY WORM.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	EXT. MEEREEN.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	Overhead, the shadow of a flying dragon soars in the moonlight. On the ground, the Unsullied run through the rocky landscape. They strain to open a gate in the rockface. GREY WORM lights a torch as do the other Unsullied. They travel through the sewer tunnel.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CUT TO: Meereen slave's quarters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	Many slaves are gathered in the dark chamber, seating and standing.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) You heard her! She said she came to free us.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.)  You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	The slaves look at one another.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.) I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way: the Masters in power and the slaves dead.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM and the Unsullied enter.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.)  All men must die.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	The slaves are surprised to see them. ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE and MOSSADOR stand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) Who are you?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.) We have no training, weapons.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM and the other Unsullied remove their bundles from around their shoulders. The weapons clank as they hit the ground. The salves gather round, and a few tentatively pick up some swords.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	EXT. Meereen streets at night
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREAT MASTER #1 and two guards  walk the empty streets. They encounter some grafitti reading "Kill the Masters."
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GREAT MASTER #1: (Curses in Valyrian.)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	They look up to a high tower where a Targaryen flag is waving. Suddenly, a mob of slaves comes running at them. The guards run, leaving GREAT MASTER #1 to his own devices. He tries to flee, but more slaves pour around each corner. The slaves shout and set upon him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	EXT. Meereen streets at day
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS walks among the cheering slaves, flanked by children.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRISTAN SELMY walk down the steps on the cliff, surrounded by cheering slaves.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
s04e04	Oathkeeper	They ascend to the overlook, joining GREY WORM and the Unsullied.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa!
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS: Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JORAH: 163, Khaleesi.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS: Yes, that was it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS looks to GREY WORM, who gives a nod to  UNSULLIED #1.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	UNSULLIED #1: (shouts in Valyrian.)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	The Unsullied march forth, pressing the citizens of Meereen.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BARRISTAN SELMY: Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	DAENERYS: I will answer injustice with justice.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CUT TO: The shores of Meeeen.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	An Unsullied nails a Meereen citizen to a cross. Others scream. They line the path up the mountainside, each with one hand nailed to the post, pointing the way. The citizens watch. DAENERYS stands on a platform above, surveying the city, under the Targaryen flag. The screams echo.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	EXT. King's Landing.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN and JAIME spar by the sea. JAIME attacks and BRONN parries. JAIME pauses, panting and spins his sword. His skills have improved. They exchange attacks. BRONN presses JAIME, and they deadlock. BRONN grabs JAIME's golden hand and swats him across the face. JAIME falls to the ground.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: What the hell was that?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN tosses JAIME back his hand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: You talk to my brother this way?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: All the time. He got used to it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	They sit together on a low wall. JAIME drinks.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Do you think he did it?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME doesn't answer.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: You haven't been to see him yet, eh?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: We're done for today.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He tosses the water skin to BRONN and starts to walk way
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME exits.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. Tyrion's cell
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME and TYRION sit in the cell.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: Is that supposed to make me feel better?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: Her son?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Don't. You know what's coming?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Now that you mention it, she did ask.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: So, should I turn around and close my eyes?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Depends. Did you do it?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: Well, you could set me free.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: You know I can't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: Then there's really nothing else to say.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: Except I didn't do it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TYRION: No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. Littlefinger's ship.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA looks out on the ocean. Littlefinger enters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: Where are you taking me?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: Did you kill Joffrey?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER:Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: I know it was you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: And who helped me with this conspiracy?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: Why not?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: Then perhaps it was your husband.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: No.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: How do you know?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: I just do.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: And what do you want?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SANSA: Who could trust you?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LITTLEFINGER: I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.

s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA and MARGAERY stroll arm-in-arm in the garden.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: (laughs)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: Have you been to see Tommen yet?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: (laughs)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA:  How absentminded of me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: Mm-hmm.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: (laughs)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: Well, he could have done.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: He could have done,but he didn't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: You don't know, Grandmother.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: What? I don't understand.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLENNA: Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.

s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Very nice. Good.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON and GRENN take a break. JON speaks to the recruits.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON hands GRENN a second sword. They engage, and JON quickly knocks away one of GRENN's swords. GRENN takes a wide swing, JON ducks, then blocks his forearm and puts his blade to GRENN's throat. OLLY smiles in the crowd and GRENN nods, admitting defeat.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Let's see what you can do.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLLY steps forward, ready.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Olly, you just watch for now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	OLLY: I can fight.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.

s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORN: Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Someone has to train them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE: And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON exits.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE: Get back to work. Now! I said now!
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JANOS SLYNT: The bastard's well-liked.You're not.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE: You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JANOS SLYNT:   For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE exits.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CUT TO: the yard armory
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON returns his sword. RECRUIT joins him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE: A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE: Name's Locke.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Jon Snow.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	They shake.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: You fight well.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE: What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE: Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE: Guess I was wrong.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	There is a knocking at CERSEI's door. She drinks, ignoring it. JAIME enters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: You sent for me, Your Grace?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: What?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI:  I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: She hoped or did you promise?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME doesn't answer.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI:  And?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: He didn't do it, Cersei.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CERSEI: You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME exits.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. Tommen's bedroom.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN lies in his bed. He cannot sleep. He hears a door creaking
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: Ser Pounce?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY enters.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: How did you get past the Kingsguard?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: Kingsguard.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY:  I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY sits on his bed.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: Yes. But if my mother found out...
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace...
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: Yes? Tell me a secret.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	Sir Pounce jumps onto the bed. MARGAERY pets him
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: That's Ser Pounce.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: Very handsome.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: No. I don't think I am.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TOMMEN: We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY: When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY leans in close.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MARGAERY:  Remember, our little secret.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	She kisses TOMMEN on the forehead, and exits.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. King's Landing
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE and JAIME are looking at the history of the Kingsguard.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE: "Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME picks up a displayed sword, weighs it, and then hands it to BRIENNE. She takes it and admires it.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE: Valyrian steel.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Mmm. It's yours.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE: I can't accept this.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME reveals a suit of armor made for BRIENNE.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: I hope I got your measurements right.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE: I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	EXT. The forrest outside King's Landing
s04e04	Oathkeeper	PODRICK beams next to JAIME. BRIENNE paces. BRONN stands in the background.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE: I don't need a squire.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Of course you do.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE:  He'll slow me down.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	PODRICK: I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN approaches and clasps PODRICK's shoulder. He unwraps a bundle.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He pushed the axe onto PODRICK's chest.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRONN: What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	PODRICK exits
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE: Oathkeeper.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JAIME: Good-bye, Brienne.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE nods and exits. JAIME watches her and PODRICK ride off.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	PODRICK: Come on, move.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRIENNE looks back at JAIME, and rides on.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. Castle black library at night.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM and JON converse in the library
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM: I should neverhave taken her away.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: She wasn't safe here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM: She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Castle Black could be next.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM: I should go back for Gilly.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM: I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM: I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM: I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE enters
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SAM: Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE: Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE exits
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. Castle Black dining hall
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLINT sit at the main table.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE: Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Thank you, Ser Alliser.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON moves down to the main floor of the hall.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Ahem, brothers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GRENN knocks against the table to get their attention. The hall quiets.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	GRENN stands. JON Nods. DOLOROUS EDD stands. Three more join, and then LOCKE does.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	LOCKE: Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	ALLISER THORNE: (nods)
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JON: Thank you, brothers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	INT. Craster's Keep, night.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	KARL TANNER drinks from a human skull while sounds of rough sex spill from the background.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	WOMAN: No, don't. Don't, please.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	WOMAN #2: Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST pours himself some wine. He is drunk.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He spills wine from the skull into his mouth, greedily.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	A man rough arms one of Craster's wives into sexual submission. She wails.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER pushes down another of Craster's wives. RAST admires the back of another.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Rast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST kisses her shoulder. TANNER grabs some meat and throws it at him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Go outside and feed the beast.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST: We should kill that thing.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He stands.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He kicks RAST gently
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He slaps RAST, goading him.  RAST; I wouldn't stand a chance. None of us would.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SISSY enters with CRASTER'S BABY.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	WOMEN:  A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: What the fuck is that?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SISSY: Craster's last child. A boy.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER pulls a knife.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SISSY: He didn't kill them. He offered them.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: To who?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	SISSY: To the gods. The white walkers.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	WOMEN: A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Shut up!
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER sheaths his knife and takes CRASTER'S BABY from SISSY.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He brings CRASTER'S BABY to RAST.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Rast is headed that way.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	EXT. North of the Wall
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST carries CRASTER'S BABY. He places the baby on the ground and walks away. CRASTER'S BABY starts to cry.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CUT TO: Craster's Keep.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST returns to the keep. Ghost growls in his cage. RASK opens a flask with his teeth.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST: Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	He takes a drink. Ghost growls. RAST empties the flask in front of him. Ghost starts, and RAST falls back. After he stands, the birds sound and the snow cracks. RAST runs in terror.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST: Fuck!
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CUT TO: Bran's camp
s04e04	Oathkeeper	HODOR, BRAN, MEERA, JOJEN and Summer lay around the fire. CRASTER'S BABY's cries in the distance.

s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: Do you hear that?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: Is that a baby?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JOJEN: It's coming.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: I'm going out there.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: No, we need to stay together.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: I'm going.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN focusses inwards and his eyes turn white. Summer leaves the camp, inhabited by BRAN. He runs through the woods towards the cries of CRASTER'S BABY. Suddenly the ground gives way.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN gasps and sits up.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JOJEN:  Bran. Bran.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: Bran, what happened?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: Who?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	EXT. Craster's Keep, morning.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN, MEERA, JOJEN and JODOR watch the bustle of the keep.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	The rangers handle one of Craster's wives roughly.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: No.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: Bran, we need to go now.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: I'm not leaving without Summer.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA and JOJEN exchange a silent look.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: Can you remember where the cage was?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN: The east side of the keep.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	MEERA: If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet...
s04e04	Oathkeeper	A Ranger smashes MEERA in the face, and she falls. BRAN and JOJEN react. HODOR stands.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	HODOR: Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	They are surrounded by Night's Watch traitors.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	CUT TO: inside the keep.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	The traitors yell and prod at HODOR, who is chained around his neck.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	HODOR tries to undo his bonds. A traitor stabs him in the leg, and he groans, falling back.

s04e04	Oathkeeper	CUT TO: Interior of the Keep
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN, MEERA and JOJEN are brought into the keep. BRAN falls to the ground when released.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Help him up.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	A traitor sits him up. TANNER comes over to BRAN, and fondles his furs.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	BRAN does not answer. TANNER rises and slaps him.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER strokes MEERA's hair and face.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER releases MEERA.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	JOJEN starts to spasm. He falls to the ground
s04e04	Oathkeeper	RAST: What the fuck's wrong with him?
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER: Come here.
s04e04	Oathkeeper	TANNER grabs MEERA by the hair and pulls her away from JOJEN. He puts a knife to her throat.

s04e05	First of His Name	PYCELLE: Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	VARYS: Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	TOMMEN exchanges nodes and smiles with MARGAERY, who stands in the wings.  CERSEI LANNISTER catches their gaze, and she comes to MARGAERY. The crowd greets her as she passes through.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN: Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN #2:  Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: There he is.
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY:  Long may he reign.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Long may he reign.
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY:  He sits the throne like he was born to it.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: No, he wasn't.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: You still mourn for Joffrey?
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: He was my husband. My king.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: He would have been your nightmare.
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: Your Grace, I feel...
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: No.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it.
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY:  It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: He has you.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.
s04e05	First of His Name	SER LORAS TYRELL bows to TOMMEN on the stage.
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY:  We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: (CHUCKLES)
s04e05	First of His Name	MARGAERY: I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
s04e05	First of His Name	INT. MEEREEN COUNCIL ROOM, DAY
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS TARGARYEN, BARRISTAN SELMY, DAARIO NAHARIS, SER JORAH MORMONT, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are meeting.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
s04e05	First of His Name	BARRISTAN: And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAARIO: The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: Who told you to take the Navy?
s04e05	First of His Name	DAARIO: No one.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: So why did you do it?
s04e05	First of His Name	DAARIO: I heard you liked ships.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: How many ships?
s04e05	First of His Name	BARRISTAN: Ninety-three, Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: How many men can they carry?
s04e05	First of His Name	BARRISTAN: Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: The Lannisters have more.
s04e05	First of His Name	BARRISTAN: They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
s04e05	First of His Name	BARRISTAN: The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH stands.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty."
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.
s04e05	First of His Name	GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, DAARIO, and BARRISTAN exit.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS:  It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: (chuckles)
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
s04e05	First of His Name	JORAH: What, then?
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS: I will do what queens do. I will rule.
s04e05	First of His Name	DAENERYS walks to the balcony.
s04e05	First of His Name	EXT. OUTSIDE THE EYRIE
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA STARK and LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH approach the Eyrie.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: But how would they know?
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA puts up her hood.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand.
s04e05	First of His Name	KNIGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne.
s04e05	First of His Name	KNIGHT: Stand to.
s04e05	First of His Name	KNIGHT #2: Stand to!
s04e05	First of His Name	KNIGHT #3: Stand to!
s04e05	First of His Name	KNIGHT: Welcome back, Lord Baelish.
s04e05	First of His Name	The gate opens noisily, LITTLEFINGER and SANSA step through.
s04e05	First of His Name	CUT TO: THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN ARRYN sits on LYSA ARRYN's lap on the throne. A door opens and LITTLEFINGER and SANSA enter. ROBIN runs down to greet him.
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN: Uncle Petyr!
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: My lord.
s04e05	First of His Name	They embace.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: Oh. I have brought you a gift.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER gives ROBIN a glass bird.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Lord Baelish.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: My lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN: Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA descends to greet her visitors.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al...
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA walks to SANSA, lowers her hood and caresses her face, smiling warmly. They hug.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: My flesh and blood.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Of course. I understand.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: I would never say a thing.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN: Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: They did, and my father's.
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN: They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Make him fly?
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN: Through the Moon Door.
s04e05	First of His Name	He drops the glass bird through the Moon Door.
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN: (giggles)
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: No. We never...
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: Go. We'll speak soon.
s04e05	First of His Name	ROBIN leads SANSA out by the hand. LYSA kisses LITTLEFINGER hungrily.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: What took you so long?
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
s04e05	First of His Name	She kissed him.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Let's get married tonight.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: I do think that we could wait until...
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: Like it was yesterday.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters...
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER kisses LYSA passionately to quiet her. She moans.
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER: The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: (nods)
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER:  Tonight it is, then.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: (laughs)
s04e05	First of His Name	LITTLEFINGER:  Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA opens the door and escorts in the septon.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
s04e05	First of His Name	She kisses LITTLEFINGER
s04e05	First of His Name	CUT TO: SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA lies in bed. She can hear LYSA screaming and moaning in ecstacy. SANSA tries to ignore it.
s04e05	First of His Name	INT. KING'S LANDING, DAY
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN and CERSEI meet in the Hand's residence.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: When will the wedding take place in your mind?
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN:  A fortnight?
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: That seems reasonable.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: (shakes her head)
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: And your wedding to Loras?
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Shortly after Tommen's.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: Shortly?
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: A fortnight.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: We had that in common.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Then whom can we trust?
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: Ourselves alone.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN rises and pours some wine, handing it to CERSEI. He then pours some for himself.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Robert wasn't particularly rich.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
s04e05	First of His Name	CESEI: I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Haven't a clue.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: Go on, your best guess.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Pounds, tons, ounces?
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: That can't be.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Then how do we pay for anything?
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: How much?
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: A tremendous amount.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN sits.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.
s04e05	First of His Name	TYWIN: I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
s04e05	First of His Name	She puts her wine down and stands.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
s04e05	First of His Name	EXT. WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA STARK and SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE lie by their campfire.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: Would you shut up?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: I can't sleep until I say the names.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: Only the ones I'm going to kill.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: (chuckles) Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: If he were here right now, what would you do?
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: I'm almost done. Only one name left.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: Go on.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: The Hound.
s04e05	First of His Name	INT. AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA serves SANSA a pastry,
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Thank you.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA:  Really?
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA:  Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA eats another. LYSA takes her hand.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Yes. I'm very lucky.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: He feels responsible for you.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Loved your mother.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: No.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: That's what you wanted to say.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: No.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA holds SANSA's hands firmly and won't let go.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: No, never.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Are you pregnant?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Aunt Lysa, no, I-
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Your young, pretty body.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: Nothing. I'm a virgin.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: Don't lie to me.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: You're hurting me.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA grips harder.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA: I'll know if you lie.
s04e05	First of His Name	SANSA: I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA stands up and hugs SANSA to her breast.
s04e05	First of His Name	LYSA:  Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
s04e05	First of His Name	EXT. THE KINGSROAD, DAY
s04e05	First of His Name	LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH and PODRICK PAYNE ride the road. PODRICK struggles a bit.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: That's a long way off.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: Never, my lady. I'm your squire.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: All knights have squires, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: I swore an oath, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: I know.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: What do you think will happen if you leave?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK's horse continues to squirm and whinny.

s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND wakes and notices that ARYA is gone. He panics, looking for her. Nearby, ARYA practices her agile footwork and swordwork with needle.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: The hell you doing?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: Practicing.
s04e05	First of His Name	She continues to practice her steps.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: What, ways to die?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA:  No one's going to kill me.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA does a one-armed cartwheel.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND:  Braavos. (SCOFFS) Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: What do you know about anything?
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: It was not.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: Was? He dead?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA:  Yes.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: How?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: He was killed.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: Who by?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND:  Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA:  He was outnumbered.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND:  Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA: Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND:  The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? (LAUGHS) All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.
s04e05	First of His Name	ARYA stabs THE HOUND in the gut as hard as she can, grunting. It doesn't pierce his armor. He backhands her, and she falls. He picks up Needle and threatens her with it.
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND: Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword. (SCOFFS)
s04e05	First of His Name	THE HOUND reverses the sword and hands it back to ARYA handle first.
s04e05	First of His Name	EXT. KING'S LANDING GARDEN
s04e05	First of His Name	PRINCE OBERYN MARTELL sits writing on a scroll. CERSEI enters, flanked by guards. He stands to greet her.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: Your Grace.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN:  A poem, actually.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: May I show you the gardens?
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN:  I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: No, you couldn't.
s04e05	First of His Name	They walk through the gardens.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: I didn't realize you were a poet.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: Not a very good one.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: For your paramour?
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: For one of my daughters.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: You have several, don't you?
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: Eight.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Eight? Eight daughters?
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Beautiful name.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: Which joke is that?
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: We can avenge them.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Yes, we can avenge them.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: I know he did.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: Anything at all.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI points to a sailing ship in the bay.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
s04e05	First of His Name	OBERYN: I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI: Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
s04e05	First of His Name	CERSEI exits.

s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: Oh, no, no, no.
s04e05	First of His Name	He picks up the spit but the rabbit is engulfed in flames.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: No, no, no, no.
s04e05	First of His Name	He drops the rabbit and stamps it out.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: Hells. Gods.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE returns with firewood.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Did you remove the skin?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: No, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: No, my lady.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: No, my lady. That was the cooks.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE sits down, exasperated. She begins to remove her armor. PODRICK rushes over to help.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: What are you doing?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: I'm helping you with your armor.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK backs away
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: I killed a man.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: Who?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE: How did you kill a Kingsguard?
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK: I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE starts to remove her armor straps again, but quickly gets frustrated and stops.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRIENNE:  Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
s04e05	First of His Name	PODRICK gets up quickly to help.
s04e05	First of His Name	EXT. CRASTER'S KEEP, EVENING
s04e05	First of His Name	RAST leads a woman roughly away from the Keep. LOCKE is watching from behind a tree. RAST pushes the whimpering woman down and laughs.
s04e05	First of His Name	RAST: Hey. Hey, get up. Get up.
s04e05	First of His Name	RAST grabs her shirt from behind and pulls her up. The woman sobs. RAST pushes her forward. They pass by LOCKE. A company of men emerges from the keep.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN: That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN #2: Aye. What we need is a girl there.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN: I've got to have a piss.
s04e05	First of His Name	LOCKE sneaks into the grounds.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN: Now keep quiet.
s04e05	First of His Name	LOCKE creeps closer to the main keep, knocking a lantern as he passes, causing it to rattle and then squeak as it swings. He looks into the keep and sees the bound captives as well as some of the traitor rangers.
s04e05	First of His Name	INT: CRASTER'S KEEP
s04e05	First of His Name	Within the keep, BRAN STARK hears the squeaking, looks up and sees the swinging lantern. MEERA REED is also curious. JOJEN REED coughs.
s04e05	First of His Name	MEERA: You need water.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: It doesn't matter.
s04e05	First of His Name	MEERA: Of course it matters.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: You mustn't let anything stop you.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRAN: They already have stopped me.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: No. You're not here. You're far from here.
s04e05	First of His Name	MEERA: What does that mean?
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN has a vision. The outer wall of the keep disappears, and behind the bound BRAN, the red leaves of a wierwood reaches out in the sunset.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRAN: You've seen it, too.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRAN: We will.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
s04e05	First of His Name	MEERA: How... will we know the end?
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN looks at his hand. In his vision, it is on fire.

s04e05	First of His Name	DOLOROUS EDD: You do move quiet.
s04e05	First of His Name	JON: How many?
s04e05	First of His Name	LOCKE: Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
s04e05	First of His Name	GRENN: Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
s04e05	First of His Name	LOCKE: Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
s04e05	First of His Name	GRENN: (chuckles) Not yet.
s04e05	First of His Name	LOCKE: There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
s04e05	First of His Name	JON: Why?
s04e05	First of His Name	LOCKE: They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.
s04e05	First of His Name	GRENN: New moon tonight.

s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
s04e05	First of His Name	They enter the main building.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: Get her up.
s04e05	First of His Name	Two rangers untie MEERA. She stuggles as they bring her to her feet.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRAN: Stop.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: Stop. What are you doing?
s04e05	First of His Name	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
s04e05	First of His Name	BRAN: Stop. Stop!
s04e05	First of His Name	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.

s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER touches her hair.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?

s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER kneels before JOJEN.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: No.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER draws a knife.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: Don't close your eyes.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER turns and stands, stepping back towards MEERA.
s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN: To arms!
s04e05	First of His Name	RAST enters.

HODOR holds LOCKE above him with one had around his neck. LOCKE chokes and strains. HODOR twists his hand quickly, spanning LOCKE's neck. HODOR drops the lifeless body.

s04e05	First of His Name	JOJEN: You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?
s04e05	First of His Name	BRAN considers. He watches JON from afar. BRAN makes up his mind.

s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER spins his knives and walks towards Jon.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.
s04e05	First of His Name	They battle, JON's sword against KARL TANNER's knives. It is an even match. They pause for breath.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: You learn how to fight in a castle?
s04e05	First of His Name	They engage again. KARL TANNER gets the upper hand and stabs JON in the leg. JON groans.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?
s04e05	First of His Name	JON frees himself from the dagger and they battle again. KARL TANNER has the upper hand.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: How to fight with honor?
s04e05	First of His Name	JON slices KARL TANNER's face, who falls back. They grapple and parry.
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER: You know what's wrong with honor?
s04e05	First of His Name	KARL TANNER spits in JON's face, then sweeps his legs from under him. JON falls and KARL TANNER kicks at him, then stomps on JON's hand to prevent him from grabbing his sword. A stabbing sounds, and KARL TANNER drops his knifes and stumbles backward. SISSY has put a knife in his back. She looks terrified.

s04e05	First of His Name	RAST runs through the woods. He passes by the cages where the wolves had been penned. They are open. He looks about, and GHOST lunges on top of him. RAST screams.
s04e05	First of His Name	EXT. CRASTER'S KEEP
s04e05	First of His Name	GRENN, JON, and a Night's Watchman survey the grounds. The MAN hands JON a sword.
s04e05	First of His Name	MAN: Here's another.
s04e05	First of His Name	GRENN: Jon.
s04e05	First of His Name	GHOST approaches.
s04e05	First of His Name	JON: Where in seven hells? Come here.
s04e05	First of His Name	GHOST whines. JON pets him.
s04e05	First of His Name	JON: I missed you, boy.
s04e05	First of His Name	DOLOROUS EDD: What should we do with this lot?
s04e05	First of His Name	JON: It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
s04e05	First of His Name	MORAG: Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way.
s04e05	First of His Name	JON: You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
s04e05	First of His Name	MORAG spits.
s04e05	First of His Name	MORAG: Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
s04e05	First of His Name	CUT TO: BURNING CRASTER'S KEEP
s04e05	First of His Name	JON, DOLOROUS EDD, and GRENN watch the keep burn. So do MORAG, SISSY, and the remaining wives. The building begins to collapse.

s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	EXT: The sea outside Braavos.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS and DAVOS ride a Baratheon ship through the legs of a massive statue of a Colossus.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: Opulent Braavos chamber
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS and DAVOS wait, pacing anxiously.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: We've been here since midday.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The door opens. TYCHO NESTORIS and two other Iron bankers enter and sit.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS ponders, then sits.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO motions for DAVOS to sit. He does.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: Yes, we have heard this story.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: It's not a story. It's the truth.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: Gold you loaned him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: More than any man living.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like "usurper" and "madman" and "blood right." Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: 4,000.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: 32.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: None.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS stands to leave. DAVOS rises as well.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: My lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.  {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: The war is over.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: Ser Davos...
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: Humor me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO:  Tywin Lannister.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAV OS: How old is Tywin Lannister?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO:  67.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	STANNIS: 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYCHO: That is a problem for another time.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS displays his hand as proof.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: Braavosi bathhouse.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR SAAN  sits in a bath with two prostitutes.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, "Bring me my red shirt." The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, "Two pirate ships!" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, "Bring me my red shirt!"
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS enters.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: After the battle, the first mate asks, "Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?" The captain replies, "So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed." The next morning the lookout screams, "10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!" The crew goes silent.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS sits beside the bath, indulging SALLADOR..
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows...
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	WOMEN: "Bring me my brown pants!"
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: Only half rotted.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR and DAVOS clasp hands and laugh.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	LHARA:  I am Lhara.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR slaps her playfully and LHARA squeals.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: She's an artist, this one, truly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: We?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: You, me-- we.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: Once I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS throws down a weighty purse. SALLADOR opens it and begins counting.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR sighs in resignation.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The women laugh.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SALLADOR: You're not my friend, my friend.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAVOS: (laughs) I'll see you at sunrise.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	EXT: An Ironborn ship at sea.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA addresses the Ironborn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: "I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North."
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	While YARA reads the letter in voice over, RAMSAY and MYRANDA aggressively having sex.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MYRANDA: Yes!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA's voice over continues, as she and the Ironborn row in darkness.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince.  Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CUT TO: MYRANDA and RAMSAY
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MYRANDA: Yes! Yes!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	EXT: The waters outside the Dreadfort
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	Three Ironborn skiffs row towards  the Dreadfort
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: RAMSAY's bedroom
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MYRANDA and RAMSAY are still at it. MYRANDA moans.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	EXT: the Dreadfort castle wall.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	A grappling hook sails onto the rampart. A GUARD walks over to investigate, and receives a battle axe to the forehead. Yara comes over the wall, followeds by more ironborn raiders.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	FIRST MATE: Go left.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The Ironborn clash with the Bolton guards. YARA takes one hostage.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA:  Theon Greyjoy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	BOLTON GUARD:  I don't know--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	BOLTON GUARD: He's not in the dungeons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CUT TO: The kennel.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	Many dogs sit in cages. The FIRST MATE comes down the steps bearing a torch, followed by YARA and her hostage BOLTON GUARD.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	BOLTON GUARD: Last cage on the right.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: Thank you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	She slits his throat and takes the torch from the IRONBORN. She walks into the kennel and the dogs start barking
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: This way!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	She finds THEON, who recoils in fear. She opens his cage.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: We're going home.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: No!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: It's all right. It's me, Yara.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: You can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON:  Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	FIRST MATE:  They're here.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: If they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA and her FIRST MATE grab at THEON, trying to pull him out of the cage. The dogs bark.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: No, you can't! You can't!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: You're Theon Greyjoy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSEY enters with some Bolton guards, covered in bloody scratch marks as the dogs continue to bark. The FIRST MATE silences THEON. The Ironborn soldiers take a defensive position in front of THEON, YARA and the FIRST MATE.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: This is turning into a lovely evening.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY charges and the Ironborn and Bolton engage in battle. The dogs bark and snarl in thier cages. RAMSAY fights effectively with his daggers.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The FIRST MATE covers THEON's mouth once more.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA grapples with a Bolton guard, who bites her hand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: Aah! Theon!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON runs back into his cage, terrified. YARA quickly dispatches three guards and faces RAMSAY, panting.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY:  You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY produces a large key.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: how fast can you run?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY opens the cage.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	EXT: the shore
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA and the ironborn return to their skiff
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: Make for the ship, now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	IRONBORN: But your brother.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YARA: My brother is dead.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: The Dreadfort, morning.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY runs his hand through a warm bath. THEON stands in the background, meekly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: I have a treat for you. A reward.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: Reward?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY stands and walks to THEON.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY:  Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON removes his shirt. His torso is covered with scars.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: The britches, too, Reek. Take them off.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON removes his pants. RAMSAY points him to the bath, and he gets in, clumsily and warily. RAMSAY sits on the lip of the tub. He takes a sponge and begins to wash Theon.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: (gasps)
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: Do you love me, Reek?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: Yes, of course, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: But how can--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	THEON: Pretend to be who?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	RAMSAY: Theon Greyjoy.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	EXT: Goat Field near Meereen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	A GOATHERD and GOATHERD'S SON tend their flock. The GOATHERD'S SON throws stones in the river to amuse himself. He looks down, and suddenly Drogon flies overhead. He spits fire and takes a goat and flies off, screeching
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: Meereen throne room.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The GOATHERD stands before DAENERYS. JORAH, BARRISTAN SELMY and MISSANDEI stand with her, while GREY WORM stands guard.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: (speaking Valyrian) You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The GOATHERD stands motionless, head bowed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MISSANDEI: The Queen says you may approach and speak.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The GOATHERD steps forward and ascends the stairs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian).
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MISSANDEI: He is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: I thank him for his prayers.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MISSANDEI: (speaks Valyrian)
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The GOATHERD places his bundle on the ground and reveals the charred of his goat.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian).
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MISSANDEI: It was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian).
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MISSANDEI: He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MISSANDEI: (translates)
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS:  but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian, excitedly thanking her).
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The GOATHERD gathers his bundle and exits. DAENERYS is pleased.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: Send the next one in.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ and his MANSERVANT enters.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MANSERVANT: (Speaking Valyrian) The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: (Speaking Valyrian) The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The MANSERVANT retreats and HIZDAHR comes forward and bows.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: Queen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: I thank you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: Then it is my honor to receive you.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: Your father crucified innocent children.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: And what traditions do you speak of?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR kneels.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR: Thank you, my queen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	HIZDAHR exits with his MANSERVANT
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS: How many more?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MISSANDEI: There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	DAENERYS:  212?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	She looks to JORAH, who shrugs.

s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN meets with CERSEI, VARYS, MACE TYRELL and PYCELLE.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MACE: Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN enters and everyone rises, save OBERYN. TYWIN sits and the head of the table.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MACE: Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	Everyone sits.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: A coward and a traitor.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: Disgraceful.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Make it 100. What else?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: More whispers from the east, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: The Targaryen girl?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: Conquered with what?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: Mormont is spying on her for us.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: How, my lord? By force?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MACE stands to retrieve them, and exits.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: The Iron Throne room
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Prince Oberyn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: Lord Varys...
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: And yet everyone does.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: Five years.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: May I ask why?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: 'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Most of us aren't princes.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: It's a long story.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: One you don't like telling people.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: People I trust.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS doesn't answer.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: You did like boys before?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: (shakes his head)
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN:  Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN:  What then?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS:  Nothing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: Everybody is interested in something.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: Such as?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS doesn't answer, but looks over to the throne instead. He exits.  OBERYN ponders.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: TYRION's cell
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME peeks through the window of the cell. TYRION sits on his bed. JAIME asks the guard to open the door, then enters the cell.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Let me guess, I've been pardoned.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME nods an order to the guards behind him. They put him in manacles.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Really?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: Father's orders.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	A door opens, and JAIME and TYRION enter. TYRION walks down the aisle through the crowd,  flanked by two guards.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MAN: Kingslayer!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne, TYWIN at his side. TYRION Is led to the accused dais, where his wrists are freed. JAIME steps away, as do the guards. OBERYN and MACE TYRELL stand just to the right of the Iron Throne. TYRION takes measure of the room.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN motions to TOMMEN, who rises in response. Everyone in the hall does as well, including MARGAERY, LORAS and CERSEI.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TOMMEN: I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TOMMEN exits, walking past both TYRION and JAIME. OBERYN and MACE TYRELL join TYWIN on the main platform. Everyone sits, save TYRION.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: No.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Not that I know of.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: How would you say he died, then?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Choked on his pigeon pie.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: So you would blame the bakers?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TWYIN: The crown may call its first witness.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MERYN TRANT is on the stand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MERYN TRANT: Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Silence.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MERYN TRANT exits, eyeing TYRION on his way out.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE is on the stand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: By whom?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: Without question.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd murmurs. PYCELLE removes a necklace from his sleeve.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYCELLE: This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	PYELLE: It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd murmurs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI is on the stand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: "I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid."
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MACE: Your own brother said this to you?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: (Nods.) Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: Tyrion said, "And you will know the debt is paid." What debt?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI: I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: (shakes his head)
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MARGAERY sighs. CERSEI leaves the witness stand. JAIME watches her return to her seat, and their eyes lock.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS is on the stand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MACE: Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MACE: And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd murmurs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TWYIN: You're excused, Lord Varys.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS nods and leaves the stand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Father, may I ask the witness one question?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: One.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS: Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	VARYS bows and exits. TYRION watches him go.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: We will adjourn for now.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN, OBERYN and MACE stand.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Toll the bells in an hour's time.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	GUARD: Clear the court!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd stands.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME and CERSEI look at one another. The crowd files out and TYRION sits, dejected.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT; Tywin's chambers.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN sits eating. JAIME stands.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: You'd condemn your own son to death?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: I know nothing of the sort.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME:  You've always hated Tyrion.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: He killed his king.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN:  It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME:  Justice?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: He'll be executed.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN:  No, he'll be punished accordingly.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: I'm well aware of your oath.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Done.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME is speechless.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: You have my word.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: And you have mine.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	A bell tolls and JAIME exits. TYWIN drinks.  --
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	INT: The Iron Throne room
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd assembles once again. JAIME enters and walks over to TYRION, who sits in the accused box.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Not going well, is it?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: You're going to be found guilty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Oh, you think so?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRIOM: Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	CERSEI enters. She watches her brothers whispering.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	YTRION: How do you know?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN, OBERYN and MACE enter and the crowd stands.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: Do you trust me?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: (nods)
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME: Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd sits and JAIME takes his place.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: The crown may call its next witness.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	There are footsteps. TYRION turns and is shocked to see SHAE enter. She enters the witness box, looking down.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: State your name.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: Shae.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: I swear it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Do you know this man?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE looks at TYRION.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: How do you know him?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: I know that he's guilty.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd gasps.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: He and Sansa planned it together.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd murmurs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Silence! Continue.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION sits, shocked.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd murmurs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd murmurs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	MACE: I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: His whore.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: How did you come to be in his service?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. "You belong to me now," he said. "I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd laughs.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Silence. Silence!
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: And did you?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: Did I what?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	OBERYN: Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, "I am yours and you are mine."
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Shae. Please don't.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	SHAE: I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd clamors.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	JAIME is shocked.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: You wish to confess?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION turns to the crowd.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd clamors.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: You admit you poisoned the king?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Have you nothing to say in your defense?
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: (To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: (To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYWIN: Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	TYRION: I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	The crowd clamors.
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	From HBO:
s04e06	The Laws of Gods and Men	Stannis and Davos set sail with a new strategy. Dany meets with supplicants. Tyrion faces down his father in the Throne Room.

s04e07	Mockingbird	SER JAIME LANNISTER and TYRION LANNISTER stand in the jail cell.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: You fell in love with a whore.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: At least I got to tell them what they really are.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: (laughs)
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: It is tempting.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: If he wins.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JAIME: No. Not Ser Meryn.
s04e07	Mockingbird	EXT. KING'S LANDING BATTLE PIT, DAY
s04e07	Mockingbird	SER GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE gores a prisoner on his great sword, heaving him mightily into the air. Blood streams from his mouth as THE MOUNTAIN discards his body onto the sand. CERSEI LANNISTER watches. A line of filthy prisoners wait for a similar fate, a pair of guards behind them. A GUARD pushes the next PRISONER forward.
s04e07	Mockingbird	GUARD: Go on, move it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	The GUARD pushes PRISONER #2 forward. They reach
s04e07	Mockingbird	GUARD: And you. Come on.
s04e07	Mockingbird	The prisoners reach down to pick up meager weapons. PRISONER #1 attacks THEMOUNTAIN, who parries and then disembowels him with a single blow. He takes a step forward. PRISONER #2 throws down his weapon and drops to his knees. The line of prisoners panics and the guards work to contain them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PRISONER #2: Mercy. Please. Please, mercy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	CERSEI enters as THE MOUNTAIN dispatches PRISONER #2 with a series of overhead blows.
s04e07	Mockingbird	CERSEI: Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
s04e07	Mockingbird	CERSEI looks down.
s04e07	Mockingbird	CERSEI: You seem to be in good form.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE MOUNTAIN: Who am I fighting?
s04e07	Mockingbird	CERSEI: Does it matter?
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE MOUNTAIN: (Shakes his head.)
s04e07	Mockingbird	EXT. THE RIVERLANDS
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA and THE HOUND ride up to a smoldering farm.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: Could be food.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: Could be soldiers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA and THE HOUND dismount and explore the farm. They come upon a DYING MAN, who sits propped up with a gut wound.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: Who were "they"?
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: I stopped asking a while ago.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND kneels down to inspect his wound.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: That's not gonna get better.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: Doesn't seem so.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA kneels.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: So why go on?
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: Habit.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: Nothing could be worse than this.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: Maybe nothing is worse than this.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: Who are you?
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: You her father?
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: (Shakes his head.) Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND gives him a drink of water.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DYING MAN: Wish it were wine.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: So do I.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND stabs the DYING MAN in the heart. He dies. THE HOUND wipes the blood from his knife on the man's arm.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
s04e07	Mockingbird	Suddenly, BITER jumps onto THE HOUND's back, shouting and biting his neck. THE HOUND throws BITER down, breaking his neck in the process. He turns to see RORGE, weapon drawn.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: The fuck you doing?
s04e07	Mockingbird	RORGE: There's a price on your head.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
s04e07	Mockingbird	RORGE: The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: He can't be. I don't know his name.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: What's your name?
s04e07	Mockingbird	RORGE:  Rorge.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: Thank you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA draws needle quickly and pierces RORGE in the heart. He groans and falls. ARYA wipes her sword clean on his body.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: You're learning.
s04e07	Mockingbird	EXT. CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD
s04e07	Mockingbird	The rangers train in the yard.  A horn blows
s04e07	Mockingbird	MAN: Rangers returning!
s04e07	Mockingbird	MAN #2: They return!
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON SNOW, GRENN, "DOLOROUS" EDD TOLLETT, and their party enter. The men in the yard greet them, including SAMWELL TARLY.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MAN #2: Rangers returning!
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: Greetings.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MAN #3: Didn't think I'd see you again.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON and SAM hug.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SAM: All right, Jon?
s04e07	Mockingbird	MAN #4: Welcome back, brother.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT enter on the platform above.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: Lord Snow.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON finishes greeting OLLY. They all look up. GHOST barks.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON turns and walks away
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: Come on, Ghost.
s04e07	Mockingbird	INT. CASTLE BLACK HALL
s04e07	Mockingbird	The Night's Watch is gathered for a meeting. From the floor, JON addresses ALLISER THRONE who sits at the elevated table with JANOS SLYNT. First Builder YARWICK also sits at the head table.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JANOS SLYNT: I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: We need to prepare.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: We've been preparing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: And how would we range north?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: We wouldn't.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?
s04e07	Mockingbird	GRENN: We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: They won't stop them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: The stewards.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: Who would that be?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON: The builders.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER:Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?
s04e07	Mockingbird	YARWICK: (Pauses.) No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.
s04e07	Mockingbird	The room laughs.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ALLISER: Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.
s04e07	Mockingbird	YARWICK: Aye.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JON sits in frustration.
s04e07	Mockingbird	INT. KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION sits and looks out the window. A door opens beyond his cell. SER BRONN OF THE BLACKWATER walks down the stairs and is let into the cell.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: My lord.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: You have new clothes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN:  Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: I sent for you days ago.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN:  I've been a bit busy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Doing what?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: She's dim-witted.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: And you understand the rules of inheritance?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: Falyse is forty and barren.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: (scoffs.)
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN sits.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Is it two wives you want or two castles?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: Your sister's a Lannister, too.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Does he frighten you so much?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Because you're my friend.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION doesn't answer. BRONN stands.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: I understand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: I'm sorry it has to be this way.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION extends his hand and BRONN shakes it heartily.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: We had some good days together.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Yes, we did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN pats TYRION's arm, then walks to knock on the door.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: What will you do?
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN: I hope to hear them sing it one day.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRONN exits.

s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS TARGARYEN enters to find DAARIO NAHARIS in her chambers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: But your window is not.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS walks to DAARIO and he hands her some flowers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
s04e07	Mockingbird	She hands them back.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: Don't do that again.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS sits. DAARIO kneels playfully for forgiveness.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: Tell me why you're here.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO rises.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: There is only one, and she does not want me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: You swore me your sword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: My sword is yours till the day I die.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: Very well.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS stands and pours herself some wine.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: Do what you do best.
s04e07	Mockingbird	She sits.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: Take off your clothes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO smiles. DAENERYS watches has he removes his clothes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	INT. Bathing room at Storm's End, night
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE lies in the bath. After knocking, SELYSE BARATHEON enters.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: Oh.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: Come in, my queen. Please.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: You could never disturb me.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE reaches for a vial, but MELISANDRE stops her.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE brings over the vial and MELISANDRE shakes some into the bath. She sighs.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, "Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count." A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: Not always.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE leaves the bath and walks to the potions
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: Did you use it with Stannis?
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE touches SELYSE on the cheek.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE puts on her robe.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE takes her hand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: I understand how you feel.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: Hmm.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: But that is impossible.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SELYSE: Why?
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	They look into the fire.
s04e07	Mockingbird	MELISANDRE: However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her.

s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO: Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAARIO pats JORAH on the shoulder and exits.
s04e07	Mockingbird	INT. DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS stands in her chambers. JORAH enters.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Khaleesi.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: You're here early.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Later than some.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: You don't approve?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: You neither approve nor trust.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: I did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: I trust you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: You have?
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: I have.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS considers.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Hizdahr zo Loraq?
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: (Nods.)
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS:  Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH: Yes, Khaleesi.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH starts to exit.
s04e07	Mockingbird	DAENERYS: No. Tell him you changed my mind.
s04e07	Mockingbird	JORAH exits.
s04e07	Mockingbird	EXT. THE RIVERLANDS, DAY
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND and ARYA sit by the fire. THE HOUND tends clumsily to his neck wound.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: No fire.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA stands and takes a flaming stick to THE HOUND.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND stands and backs away.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: No fire!
s04e07	Mockingbird	They stand silently. ARYA turns and puts the stick back in the fire. She sits and polishes Needle.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND sits.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOUND: I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword.
s04e07	Mockingbird	He points to his face.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: Why?
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND: Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?
s04e07	Mockingbird	ARYA: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
s04e07	Mockingbird	THE HOUND doesn't answer. ARYA stands and walks to him. She pours water on his wound and begins to sew it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	INT. AN INN, NIGHT
s04e07	Mockingbird	LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH and PODRICK PAYNE sit for dinner. The server places a pie in front of them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK drinks greedily from his cup.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: Couldn't agree more, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: Yes, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE stops PODRICK from drinking.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: Don't get drunk.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: No, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Can I get you anything else?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Thanks. I do my best.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE sits.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: We're looking for someone.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Starks? What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE stands and starts to go.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE:  I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
s04e07	Mockingbird	EXT. OUTSIDE THE INN
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE and PODRICK prepare the horses.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: What?
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: It's nothing, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE:  You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE approaches.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: What about? Not kidney pie.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: She weren't when I last spoke to her.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE:  When was that?
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE:  So what happened to her?
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: Well-
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: The quick version.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: The Hound.
s04e07	Mockingbird	HOT PIE: That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK hands a small bundle to BRIENNE. He exits. BRIENNE opens the bundle to reveal a bread shaped like a wolf.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE:  Um, you were saying?
s04e07	Mockingbird	EXT. THE KING'S ROAD
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE and PODRICK walk their horses down the road.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE:  Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: Why the Eyrie?
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE: Sansa could be there, too.
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: Aye, my lady. Could be.
s04e07	Mockingbird	BRIENNE:  You sure about this?
s04e07	Mockingbird	PODRICK: No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	They continue through the woods.
s04e07	Mockingbird	INT. TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION sits in the dark, sadly. The door opens and PRINCE OBERYN MARTELL enters, bearing a torch..
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN puts down his torch and sits.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: Your sister.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Oh.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: I think I would have remembered that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: That would have made things so much easier.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, "Soon." Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. "That's not a monster," I told Cersei. "That's just a baby." And she said, "He killed my mother." And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. "It doesn't matter," she told us. "Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
s04e07	Mockingbird	TYRION: If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: I disagree.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN rises.
s04e07	Mockingbird	OBERYN: I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion.
s04e07	Mockingbird	EXT. THE EYRIE COURTYARD
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA STARK walks out to the courtyard. It is snowing. She builds a model of Winterfell from snow. ROBIN ARRYN enters.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Hello, Robin.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: What are you doing?
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: Why did you leave?
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: It's a long story.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Yes, you certainly are.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: When will you go back?
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: We don't.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I like the sound of that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: All right.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: It can go in here in this big tower.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN reaches to show her, and accidentally knocks down the snow tower.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: I didn't ruin it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: You did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN: It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN:  I didn't ruin it!
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: You're being stupid.
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN:  I didn't ruin it!
s04e07	Mockingbird	ROBIN, in a tantrum, kicks and smashes the snow castle. Shocked, SANSA slaps him. ROBIN exits, sobbing.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Robin, I'm sorry, I-
s04e07	Mockingbird	LORD PETYR "LITTLEFINGER" BAELISH enters.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: Children.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I hit him.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: Yes, I saw.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I shouldn't have done that.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: If he tells Aunt Lysa...
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER touches SANSA's hair.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: You're more beautiful than she ever was.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Lord Baelish...
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: Call me Petyr.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER kisses SANSA. Above them, LYSA has been watching, and she exits quickly.
s04e07	Mockingbird	INT. THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA enters. LYSA stands looking out the Moon Door.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: Come here, Sansa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA joins her beside the Moon Door.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: Do you know how far the fall is?
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: No.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: I didn't. You don't understand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA grabs SANSA's forearm.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA:  He kissed me. I pulled away.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA grabs SANSA's hair and forces her to lean over the moon door.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: Liar! Whore! He is mine!
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA pushed SANSA onto her hands and knees.
s04e07	Mockingbird	SANSA: Please!
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: Lysa! Let her go.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: You want her? This empty-headed child?
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: Let her go.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA: She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LYSA cries. She pushes SANSA away from the moon door and begins weeping. LITTLEFINGER approaches her and hugs her.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER helps LYSA to stand.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER: I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister.
s04e07	Mockingbird	LITTLEFINGER pushes LYSA through the Moon Door. She screams as she falls.

s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JON: If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ED: A hundred thousand.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GRENN: And there's what, 5 of us left.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ED: If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PYP: How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ED: Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Everyone takes a drink]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: MEEREEN
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Men and women are seen swimming in a lake. They're bathing and washing clothes. Grey Worm looks over at Missandei who is naked. Missandei sees him looking, he looks away ashamed then looks back. She stands up proudly, then covers up. He dunks his head under water]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: You think he was spying on you?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: No, not spying.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: Yes your grace.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: But you are not Dothraki.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: He was interested.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: What?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: I believe he was interested.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: All of it?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: The...the pillar an the stones.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: I don't know, your grace.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Haven't you ever wondered?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: Yes, your grace.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Missandei is seen walking up toward Dany's throne. Grey Worm enters]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: To me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: To me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: When they cut you, do you remember that?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Grey Worm shakes his head no]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: Why? Why sorry?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: *approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Grey Worm turns around and begins to walk away]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Grey Worm stops and turns around]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* So am I.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Grey Worm turns and walks out of the throne room]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: And what are you really?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: I'm Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: I'm Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Until when?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: Always. Forever.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Theon approaches the castle on horseback]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GUARD 1: *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Theon enters the castle walls. Inside a lot of people are sick or dying]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: Yes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: And why should I believe that?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	EVERYONE: What is dead may never die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: And what does Lord Bolton want?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Theon hands Kenning a scroll]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: He wants us to surrender?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Kenning falls to the ground. His men pick him up]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: ...shame fought with honor.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: I'm sorry, I didn't hear...
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Kenning spits blood in Theon's face]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: *scared* You don't know.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: The Ironborn will not surrender.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: *whispering* Reek. Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RALF: You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[MAN 4 kills Kenning with an axe]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: Reek.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MAN 4: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Cut to MAN 4's body with no skin and his eye cut out]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	THEON: Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: I believe we will. To our new home.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: THE VALE
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: My lord...
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn...
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: We were told there was a witness. A girl.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: A niece of yours, I believe.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: We'd like to speak with her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: Let me fetch her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Sansa Stark enters the room]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: My lady...
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: I wasn't asking you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: He can stay.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER VANCE: Your secret is safe with us, my lady.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Lady Sansa.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Sansa looks up at Petyr]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Lord Royce, Lady Anya, and Petyr walk down the stairs]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Are you questioning our courage?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LADY ANYA: More often they die young.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD ROYCE: Aye, it's time.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: MEEREEN
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	BOY: Ser Barristan.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER BARRISTAN: Yes? Who sent you?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[A boy hands a scroll to Ser Barristan. He reads it]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ser Jorah is looking at a map by the water alone]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Ser Barristan.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Have I forgotten a council meeting?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER BARRISTAN: No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ser Barristan hands Ser Jorah the scroll]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: What's this?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER BARRISTAN: A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Who gave you this?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER BARRISTAN: Does it matter?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Have you told her?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER BARRISTAN: I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Let me speak with her in private.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER BARRISTAN: You'll never be alone with her again.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ser Barristan leaves]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ser Jorah enters Dany's throne room, walking toward her]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Why did the usurper pardon you?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: If we could speak alone.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: No, speak to me here. Explain it to me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: It is not forged.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Why, then?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: What was the content of these letters?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Information.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: What information?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: I...
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Yes or no?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Khaleesi.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Yes.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: I stopped you from drinking his wine.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Because you knew it was poisoned.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: I suspected.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: You betrayed me from the first.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: ...and you want me to forgive you?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: I have loved you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SER JORAH: Daenerys, please.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ser Jorah goes for Dany's hand]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	DANY: Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ser Jorah rides away from Mereen]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ramsay is seen holding a flag out to Lord Bolton]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Moat Cailin is yours, Father.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	LORD BOLTON: Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: No.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Moors, fields, hills.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Tell me what you see.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Nothing.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ROOSE: Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Ramsay Snow.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ROOSE: No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[The Bolton army rides forward on horseback]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	RAMSAY: Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: THE VALE
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Sansa is seen sitting on her bed sewing. Petyr knocks on her door]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: Yes?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: That's not an answer.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: I don't know.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: Neither do I.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: I know what you want.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: Do you?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[She looks up at him]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE VALE
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Arya and the Hound approach the Vale]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: Lots of things make me happy.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: Like what?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: *laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: You should have let me burn it.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: It's a fleabite.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: Well, we won't have to walk too much further.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: You really think my aunt will pay for me?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: Aye, she'll pay.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: I've never even met her.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ARYA: I'm not a lady.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GUARD: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	HOUND: The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	GUARD: Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Arya bursts out laughing]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: THE VALE
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Petyr is walking down the stairs with Robin]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ROBIN: I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: You shouldn't be.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ROBIN: The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PETYR: It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Sansa enters the scene and walks down the stairs, Petyr looks at her]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	SANSA: Shall we go?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[In prison, Tyrion drinks wine from Jaime]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Soon.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: I've never seen him fight.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Oberyn believes in himself.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Beheading.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Cousins.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TOGETHER: Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Nothing made him happier.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: The joke wore thin, though.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: For you. You drifted away.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: I had other interests.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Why?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. "Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?" He gave me an answer. "Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of "khuu, khuu, khuu". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard "khuu, khuu, khuu" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: He was twice your size.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: He just pushed me aside with a "khuu" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: I don't know.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Bells begin chiming in the distance. Jaime goes to leave]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	JAIME: Good luck today.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Tyrion walks out toward the arena. The Lannisters are there, Oberyn is there getting ready for the battle. Tyrion passes him in handcuffs]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Looks like very light armor.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: I like to move around.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: Today is not the day I die.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ELLARIA: You're going to fight that?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: I'm going to kill that.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ELLARIA: He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYRION: Thank the gods.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	PYCELL: In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Tywin speeds the process along in boredom. Horns sound to start the fight. Oberyn kisses Ellaria]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	ELLARIA: Don't leave me alone in this world.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: Never.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Oberyn is tossed his weapon. He's very good with it. The crowd cheers]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: Have they told you who I am?
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MOUNTAIN: Some dead man.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[The Mountain lunges forward as the battle begins]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Oberyn stabs the Mountain in the gut]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her!
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Oberyn charges at the Mountain to give him one final blow]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: You killed her children!
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Everyone looks down, surprised. Oberyn pulls his weapon out of the Mountain and starts walking around his body]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	OBERYN: Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[The Mountain trips Oberyn and grabs him in his massive hands. He punches out his teeth and gets on top of Oberyn, squeezing his head]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	MOUNTAIN: Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	[Ellaria screams in agony. Tyrion looks dead inside]
s04e08	The Mountain and the Viper	TYWEN: *standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.

s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Opens on Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly standing on the edge of The Wall. It's night]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: What was she like?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: She...she had red hair.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Oh? How big were her feet?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Well what do you want me to say?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: So you and Gilly never-
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: What?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: "I shall take no wife" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. "I shall father no children" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: No, you're really not.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: There will.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam gets in the lift back down off the wall. An owl perches on a post. Cut to the Wildlings where Thenn warg is standing with his eyes white. Ygritte, Tormund, and Styr are sitting in the background]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Yes.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: We could be waiting here a while.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	STYR: You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	STYR: Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: I probably killed him already.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	STYR: So you've said.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	STYR: And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Everyone laughs. Ygritte gets up and rushes towards Styr]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	STYR: Maybe I have.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Gilly walks along the top of the hill with her baby, looking down at the Wildling camp. She walks away quickly. Cut to Sam in the library reading]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Maester Aemon. How did you know-
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Let me help you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Maester Faull
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I don't love her.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: Yes you do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: No.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: You were?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Who was she?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	AEMON: Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Aemon gets up and blows out the candle. Sam leaves the room and outside hears Gilly at the gate talking with Pypar]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: I'm sorry, I can't.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Pyp! Open the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: I can't.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: Sam, is that you?!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Yes!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Pyp goes to open the gate]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: I've never heard you curse before.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Yes, well, best get used to it.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Gilly runs inside and Sam embraces her]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: It was horrible.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: Don't let them send me away, Sam.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Never.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: I know there's no women allowed.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[A horn sounds in the distance]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Get ready!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Members of the Night's Watch can be heard shouting frantically. The owl screeches. Cut to Thenn warg whose eyes turn back to normal]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	THENN WARG: It's time.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The Wildlings get up and look at the hill. The owl flies away as the Night's Watch prepare for battle. Jon Snow walks out to the edge of The Wall and looks down upon flames in the distance. The Night's Watch light torches preparing for battle. Barrels are rolled to the edge of The Wall]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: Pick up the pace!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The barrels are rolled into place]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: A hundred thousand you say?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Yes sir.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam and Gilly are walking down a hall. Sam unlocks a door and they both enter. The room is filled with supplies. Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: You're leaving me again?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I'm not leaving you!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I...I didn't mean in the same room.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: What are you going to do out there?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Help my brothers.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam kisses Gilly]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GILLY: Promise me you won't die.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I promise you I won't die.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam turns around and leaves the room. Outside the Night's Watch is still getting ready for battle. Pyp sets some arrows up then stands back, scared]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: But you're afraid now?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Ygritte looks up at Castle Black. She sees Sam in the tower and she runs down the hill toward the other Wildlings]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	STYR: How high are the walls?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: Let's kill some Crows!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Everyone cheers]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The Wildlings head towards Castle Black. Overhead shot pans to show the castle, The Wall, and then the flames in the distance. Mance Rayder's forces are seen stomping and yelling through the woods. A giant rides a giant mammoth. The Night's Watch perched upon the wall look down at them in awe]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Archers knock, everyone else hold.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The archers get ready to shoot, Grenn accidentally drops a barrel]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: You all plan to die here tonight?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: That's very good to hear. Draw!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	MEMBER 1: Help, down below.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Tormund and his men rush Castle Black as archers shoot at them. Ygritte grabs flaming arrows from the ground and shots up at the Night's Watch]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: They're attacking the southern gates!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Now?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: Now!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: What?!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: What are you fucking waiting for, loose!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: You heard the man. Loose!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The archers on The Wall let loose a barrage of arrows downward at Rayder's troops. They back up, then cheer. On the other side, Ygritte continues to let loose flaming arrows]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: You, over there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Pyp shoots a crossbow down at Tormund's troops]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Did you get one?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Yeah?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: I think we're gonna die.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: If you keep missing we will.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Tormund's troops throw rope up at the gate. Alliser steps off the lift and walks towards the Night's Watch]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	NIGHT'S WATCH: No!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Night's Watch cheers]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: The Night's Watch will stand.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Night's Watch cheers]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: With me now! Now, with me!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Alliser and the Night's Watch rush at the Wildlings that have scaled the gate. Pyp and Sam leave their position as Tormund scales the gate. On the other side Rayder's troops advance]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: We can't just let them attack the gate!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JANOS: Needed below? Yes. Yes.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Janos runs away. Jon and Grenn nod at each other]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The archers let loose a bunch of arrows at Rayder's men as they rush the wall and begin to climb]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: They won't summit before dawn.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: How do you know that?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Because I've made that claim.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Archers of the Night's Watch are lowered perpendicular to The Wall]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Knock! Draw! Loose!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[A Wildling tries to shoot an arrow up at The Wall unsuccessfully. A giant stands next to him and shoots his own arrow up. The first rips through one of the posts. The second clears one of the Night's Watch straight off the wall. At Castle Black the fighting continues. Styr kills a man, the blood splatters on Olly's face. Janos comes down off the lift and Olly returns the lift to the top. Wildlings break into the kitchen. Janos cowardly runs down a hall toward where Gilly and her baby are hiding. He looks at her in shock. Outside Pyp finally hits someone with his crossbow.]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Oh, is it over?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	PYP: Huh?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Pyp goes up to shoot a Wildling, but Ygrytte shoots an arrow right through his neck. He falls into Sam's arms]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Now!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: Now!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The Night's Watch drop barrels down toward the Wildlings that approach the gate. Two giants and a mammoth approach the gate and begin pulling at it with long ropes]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: *to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: Alright.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: *grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Oil!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: Oil on the ramp!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Protect the gate!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Alliser and Tormund start fighting each other like badasses. Tormund slices Alliser in the gut. Alliser falls to the ground and gets dragged  underneath]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ALLISER: Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam sits with Pyp on his lap, dead. He lays him on the ground and grabs the crossbow. He makes a run for the lift as Thenn warg sees him and chases after him. Sam shoots him in the head with his crossbow. Grenn and the men that came down with him get off the lift]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: *to Grenn* We need more men down here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: We have to hold the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: But we need men here.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam gets in the lift]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: *to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Olly sits on the ground with his hands over his ears in fear]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Olly raises the lift]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Olly looks down at a bow and arrow. On The Wall, barrels of flaming oil are dropped down on the giants and the mammoth. The mammoth goes running off and one of the giants chases after it. Up top, one of the barrels got stuck and the men of the Night's Watch frantically try to get it off the ramp. A spear is fired down at one of the giants and it hits him right in the back. The other giant shouts in anger and goes to raise the gate with his bare hands. The barrel explodes on the ramp. Sam approaches Jon]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: What are you doing up here?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Jon leaves his post and grabs his sword]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Two brothers now fight with me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Grenn gets to the inner gate with his men as the giant continues to raise the gate]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	DONNEL: How are we gonna stop that?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	COOPER: We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: You heard Jon, we hold the gate.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	DONNEL: Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: We hold the gate!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The giant lifts the gate and goes under it]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	DONNEL: Mother save me. Father save me.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	DONNEL: No, please.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The giant rushes toward the inner gate as Grenn and his men stand in fear, ready to fight]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	GRENN: Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	All TOGETHER: And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Jon, Sam, and the other men ride the lift to the bottom]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: *to Sam* I don't want you out there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Jon hands Sam a key]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: I need him more than I need you.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam nods as Jon opens the lift door early and leaps out and begins fighting. So begins the most incredible shot in the series, as the camera pans around the entire battlefield showing us glimpses of this truly epic battle. Sam runs to a door and unlocks it]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: We need you boy.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Ghost runs out and attacks one of the men that Jon was fighting. Tormund gets his first arrow to the back. Styr sees Jon and rushes to fight him. They go at it for a bit. Ygritte runs out of arrows so she jumps down and steals some from a dead body. Styr and Jon are still fighting as Ygritte finally spots Jon. Styr slams Jon's face against an anvil. Jon kills Styr with a hammer. As he turns around he sees Yrgitte with an arrow aimed right at him. They both stare, Jon smiles. An arrow goes straight through Ygritte's chest. She falls to the ground. It was Olly, that bastard. Jon rushes to catch Ygritte]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Jon Snow.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: No, shh, don't talk.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: Do you remember that cave?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Jon nods]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: We should've stayed in that cave.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: We'll go back there.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Ygritte dies. The battle rages on as Jon holds Ygritte's dead body. On the other side, Rayder's troops are climbing the wall]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: Drop the scythe, boys!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[A massive scythe drops down on the men]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: Hoister up!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Rayder's troops retreat]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: They've had enough for one night.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[The Night's Watch cheers in excitement]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	ED: Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Inside Castle Black's walls Tormund is still alive, swinging his sword with two arrows in his back]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Tormund. It's over, let it end.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: This is how a man ends.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Jon grabs a crossbow and shoots Tormund in the leg then kicks away his weapon]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	TORMUND: I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Aye, you should've.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Gilly hears someone entering her room. She grabs a leg of meat as a weapon and rushes the door]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam turns around and sees Janos. Outside the Night's Watch clean up after the battle. Sam and Jon descend the stairs]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: We held them off.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: For one night.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: This is a great victory.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Where are you going?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: I'm going to find Mance.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: I'm going to try.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Jon stands there for a second as he and Sam look at each other, then he walks off, Sam scampering after him. They walk down the tunnel toward the gate. The giant and Grenn and his men are dead on the ground]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	[Sam waves his torch to signal the raising of the gate. Jon removes his sword]
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: What are you doing?
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	JON: I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
s04e09	The Watchers on the Wall	SAM: Jon. Come back.

s04e10	The Children	[Jon Snow leaves the tunnel and walks out into the snow. Smoking dead bodies lie all around him. As he walks into the forest he becomes surrounded by Wildlings. He has entered the Wildling camp unarmed]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: You're wearing a black cloak again.
s04e10	The Children	JON: I've been sent to negotiate with you.
s04e10	The Children	[Mance and Jon enter Mance's tent and take a seat]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.
s04e10	The Children	JON: The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?
s04e10	The Children	JON: She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Did you see her again at Castle Black?
s04e10	The Children	JON: Yes.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: And?
s04e10	The Children	JON: She's dead.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Your doing?
s04e10	The Children	JON: No.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: We'll drink to her.
s04e10	The Children	[One of the Wildlings gets two cups and fills them with liquid. Jon looks at Mance]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last.
s04e10	The Children	[They pick up their cups]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Ygritte.
s04e10	The Children	JON: Ygritte.
s04e10	The Children	[They take a sip and Jon begins to cough]
s04e10	The Children	JON: That's not wine.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.
s04e10	The Children	JON: He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
s04e10	The Children	JON: Grenn came from a farm.
s04e10	The Children	[They lift their cups]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Mag and Grenn.
s04e10	The Children	JON: Grenn and Mag.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?
s04e10	The Children	JON: Turn your army around and go home.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
s04e10	The Children	JON: I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black.
s04e10	The Children	[Jon looks over towards the knife. The Wildlings get their weapons ready]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?
s04e10	The Children	[A horn blows in the distance. Everyone scrambles, Mance draws a knife to Jon's neck]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: You attacking us?
s04e10	The Children	JON: No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.
s04e10	The Children	[The Wildlings run around frantically. Men on horseback ride toward them]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Hold! To me. To me.
s04e10	The Children	[The horsemen continue toward the Wildlings, killing all in their path. The Wildlings fight back, clearly outnumbered]
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
s04e10	The Children	[Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth ride up toward Mance Rayder. They get off their horses. Mance disarms himself]
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: You're the king beyond the wall?
s04e10	The Children	[Mance nods]
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: You know who I am?
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: Never had the pleasure.
s04e10	The Children	DAVOS: This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: We do not kneel.
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.
s04e10	The Children	MANCE: All the same, we do not kneel.
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: Take these men away.
s04e10	The Children	DAVOS: What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
s04e10	The Children	JON: I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
s04e10	The Children	DAVOS: You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
s04e10	The Children	JON: I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: Your father was an honorable man.
s04e10	The Children	JON: He was, your grace.
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: What do you think he'd have done with him?
s04e10	The Children	JON: I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.
s04e10	The Children	STANNIS: Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
s04e10	The Children	JON: Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.
s04e10	The Children	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
s04e10	The Children	[Qyburn is seen closely analyzing Gregor's body. He's in Pycelle's lab with Cersei]
s04e10	The Children	PYCELLE: I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Bloody Martells.
s04e10	The Children	PYCELLE: The cause appears to be manticore venom.
s04e10	The Children	QYBURN: It is, yes, manticore.
s04e10	The Children	PYCELLE: I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done.
s04e10	The Children	QYBURN: Yes there is.
s04e10	The Children	PYCELLE: May I ask what you think you're doing?
s04e10	The Children	QYBURN: Saving him.
s04e10	The Children	PYCELLE: Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester.
s04e10	The Children	QYBURN: That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
s04e10	The Children	PYCELLE: That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: You're dismissed, Grand Maester.
s04e10	The Children	PYCELLE: Your grace. This is my laboratory!
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Not anymore.
s04e10	The Children	[Pycelle leaves the laboratory angrily as Qyburn tries to save Gregor's body]
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: You can save him?
s04e10	The Children	QYBURN: Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
s04e10	The Children	QYBURN: Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Will it weaken him?
s04e10	The Children	QYBURN: Oh no.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Very well then.
s04e10	The Children	[Cersei leaves as Qyburn drains Gregor's blood. Cersei is seen arguing with Tywin]
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I'm opening it again.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I will not.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: No.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: And how will you do that?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I'll tell everyone the truth.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: And what truth would that be?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Known what?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: No, no, no, no, no.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Your legacy is a lie.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: I don't believe you.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Yes you do.
s04e10	The Children	[Cersei walks away, leaving Tywin standing there alone. Jaime is turning pages in a book in another room]
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Jaime.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Tyrion is your family.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: He's not.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: You don't get to choose.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-
s04e10	The Children	[Cersei kisses Jaime]
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I choose you.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Those are words.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Told him what?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I told him about us.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: You told him?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: You think he'll just accept that?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: Go and ask him.
s04e10	The Children	[Cersei kisses Jaime]
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: What did you say?
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.
s04e10	The Children	[Cersei kisses Jaime's metal hand. Jaime pulls her close and kisses her]
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Someone will walk in.
s04e10	The Children	CERSEI: I don't care.
s04e10	The Children	[Jaime picks Cersei up and lays her on the table as the start having sex.]
s04e10	The Children	CUT TO: MEREEN
s04e10	The Children	[Daenerys is sitting on her throne listening to her people's problems]
s04e10	The Children	MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: *in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: You speak it very well.
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you.
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: What is it that you want from me?
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
s04e10	The Children	FENNESZ: Thank you, your grace. Thank you.
s04e10	The Children	[Fennesz leaves slowly]
s04e10	The Children	BARRISTAN: The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
s04e10	The Children	[Another man enters the hall]
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: Approach my friend.
s04e10	The Children	MAN: *in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen.
s04e10	The Children	MISSANDEI: *in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.
s04e10	The Children	MAN: *crying, speaking Low Valyrian*
s04e10	The Children	MISSANDEI: *translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...
s04e10	The Children	[The man kneels on the ground sobbing, laying a pile of burnt bones on the ground]
s04e10	The Children	MISSANDEI: *translating* My girl. My little girl.
s04e10	The Children	[The man continues to sob. In another room Daenerys is speaking with Missandei]
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: What was her name?
s04e10	The Children	MISSANDEI: Zala, your grace.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: How old was she?
s04e10	The Children	MISSANDEI: Three.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
s04e10	The Children	GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then.
s04e10	The Children	DAENERYS: *in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
s04e10	The Children	[The entrance to the catacombs is rolled open. Daenerys' dragons enter followed by Daenerys. Inside there is food for them. They chomp at the food as Daenerys puts a chain collar around their necks. She walks away crying as they screech at her. She turns around as the catacombs close with tears in her eyes.]
s04e10	The Children	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s04e10	The Children	[Aemon and the rest of the Night's Watch burn the bodies of their fallen comrades]
s04e10	The Children	AEMON: They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.
s04e10	The Children	ALL TOGETHER: And now their watch is ended.
s04e10	The Children	AEMON: And now their watch is ended.
s04e10	The Children	Aemon passes the torch around as each member of the Night's Watch helps burn the bodies. Stannis watches from above. [Jon Snow and Melisandre share a look]
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: Your old blind man patched me up. Why?
s04e10	The Children	JON: He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: You want me alive so you can torture me?
s04e10	The Children	JON: No one's going to torture you.
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
s04e10	The Children	JON: I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: Who decides?
s04e10	The Children	JON: I suppose Stannis does.
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: He your king now?
s04e10	The Children	JON: I don't have a king.
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.
s04e10	The Children	JON: We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: Words? What kind of words?
s04e10	The Children	JON: Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: Do what?
s04e10	The Children	JON: Say farewell.
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: The dead can't hear us, boy.
s04e10	The Children	[Jon walks away]
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.
s04e10	The Children	JON: She told you?
s04e10	The Children	TORMUND: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?
s04e10	The Children	[Jon leaves and takes Ygritte's body out past The Wall. He burns her body in a pile of logs.]
s04e10	The Children	CUT TO: BEYOND THE WALL
s04e10	The Children	[Hodor drags Bran through the snow followed by Jojen and Meera Reed]
s04e10	The Children	MEERA: We can stop, we can rest.
s04e10	The Children	JOJEN: We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.
s04e10	The Children	[Jojen falls to the ground]
s04e10	The Children	MEERA: We're not going to make it.
s04e10	The Children	JOJEN: We're already here.
s04e10	The Children	BRAN: Jojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look.
s04e10	The Children	[The group stands at the edge of a cliff. A large tree is seen  not too far off in the distance. They head toward it. As they walk a skeleton hand reaches up and drags Jojen to the ground. It starts pulling him backwards as Meera runs towards him]
s04e10	The Children	MEERA: JOJEN! Hold on!
s04e10	The Children	BRAN (to Hodor): Help them! Now!
s04e10	The Children	MEERA: Hold on to me!
s04e10	The Children	[More hands burst from the ground.]
s04e10	The Children	HODOR: Hodor...
s04e10	The Children	BRAN: Help them!
s04e10	The Children	[Skeleton warriors have now emerged from the ground. They attack Jojen, Meera and Hodor. A brawl ensues. One of them attacks Bran until his direwolf, Summer, fights it off. Bran then wargs into Hodor and starts fighting back.]
s04e10	The Children	JOJEN: Bran! Save yourself, now!
s04e10	The Children	[Meera defeats a skeleton warrior, only to see another repeatedly stabbing Jojen. Just as two skeletons close in on the warging Bran, they’re destroyed by two fireballs, apparently controlled by a young girl.]
s04e10	The Children	GIRL: Come with me, Brandon Stark!
s04e10	The Children	[She looks at Meera and Jojen.]
s04e10	The Children	GIRL: He is lost. Come with me, or die with him.
s04e10	The Children	[JOJEN: Go with them.
s04e10	The Children	The girl throws some more fireballs and the group move into a cave. When the skeletons try to follow, they explode.]
s04e10	The Children	GIRL: They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.
s04e10	The Children	BRAN: Who are you?
s04e10	The Children	GIRL: The First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you.
s04e10	The Children	[They enter a room filled with tree roots. An old man is seated in the center. Bran approaches him.]
s04e10	The Children	BRAN: You’re the three-eyed raven.
s04e10	The Children	OLD MAN: I have been many things. Now, I am what you see.
s04e10	The Children	MEERA: My brother, he led us to you, and now he…
s04e10	The Children	OLD MAN: He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway.
s04e10	The Children	MEERA: How do you know?
s04e10	The Children	OLD MAN: I’ve been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you’ve come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.
s04e10	The Children	BRAN: I didn’t want anyone to die for me.
s04e10	The Children	OLD MAN: He died so that you could find what you have lost.
s04e10	The Children	BRAN: You’re going to help me walk again?
s04e10	The Children	OLD MAN: You’ll never walk again. But you will fly.
s04e10	The Children	CUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS
s04e10	The Children	[Brienne and Podrick wake up in the open air on their way to the Eyrie.]
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?
s04e10	The Children	PODRICK: I hobbled them last night.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: What sort of hobble?
s04e10	The Children	PODRICK: A figure-eight, like you taught me.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.
s04e10	The Children	PODRICK: Thieves, maybe?
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: It’s at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You’re carrying the saddle bags.
s04e10	The Children	[Brienne sees Arya Stark practising her river-dancing.]
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: People coming. You can shit later, there’s people coming!
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Morning!
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Morning.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: About ten more miles.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Are you a knight?
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: No.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: But you know how to use that sword.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I do.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Does it have a name?
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: “Oathkeeper.”
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Mine’s “Needle.”
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Good name.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Who taught you how to fight?
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: My father.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right.”
s04e10	The Children	[Sandor “The Hound” Clegane emerges.]
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Seven blessings. I’m Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne.
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: You want something?
s04e10	The Children	PODRICK: That’s Sandor Clegane- the Hound.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: You’re Arya Stark.
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: I asked if you wanted something.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: My mother’s dead.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I know. I wish I could’ve been there to protect her.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: You’re not a northerner.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Why didn’t you?
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King’s Landing.
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: You’re paid by the Lannisters. You’re here for the bounty on me.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I’m not paid by the Lannisters.
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: No? Fancy sword you’ve got there. Where’d you get it? I’ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that’s not Lannister gold.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: I don’t care what you swore!
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Arya!
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: You heard the girl! She’s not coming with you.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: She is.
s04e10	The Children	[Brienne and The Hound both draw their swords.]
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: You’re not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I’ve always wanted some Valyrian steel.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Come with me Arya. I’ll take you to safety.
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: Safety?! Where the fuck’s that? Her aunt in the Eyrie’s dead. Her mother’s dead, her father’s dead, her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a pile of rubble. There’s no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: And that’s what you’re doing? Watching over her?
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: Aye, that’s what I’m doing.
s04e10	The Children	[They begin a swordfight. The Hound seems to have the upper hand but Brienne defends well and floors him.]
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: I have no wish to kill you Ser.
s04e10	The Children	[The Hound grabs Brienne’s blade with his palms, shoves it to one side and punches her.]
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: I’m not a knight.
s04e10	The Children	[They fight bare-handed, Brienne bites off The Hound's ear, then The Hound draws a knife, and Brienne grabs a rock. She pushes The Hound down a steep cliff.]
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
s04e10	The Children	PODRICK: She was just here...
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Why weren’t you watching her?
s04e10	The Children	PODRICK: I was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Which way Pod? Which way did she go?
s04e10	The Children	PODRICK: Ah, I think that way.
s04e10	The Children	BRIENNE: Arya!
s04e10	The Children	[The camera moves to show us Arya hiding just above Brienne. She walks down to The Hound.]
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: You’re still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: I don’t need saving.
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: No, not you. You’re a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: You’re gonna die?
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: Unless there’s a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done. I’d skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. (Chuckles) I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She’ll help you. Going out alone, you won’t last a day out there.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: I’ll last longer than you.
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I’m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher’s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don’t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I should’ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I should’ve fucked her bloody. At least I’d have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it.
s04e10	The Children	[Arya stands up, takes The Hound’s coin purse, and walks away.]
s04e10	The Children	HOUND: Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
s04e10	The Children	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
s04e10	The Children	[We enter Tyrion’s cell. The door opens.]
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Is that any way to speak about our mother?
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: What’re you doing?
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: Who’s helping you?
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Varys.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: Varys?
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: You have more friends than you thought.
s04e10	The Children	[They reach the end of the underground tunnel.]
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: I suppose this is goodbye, then.
s04e10	The Children	[They hug.]
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Farewell, little brother.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: Jaime, thank you. For my life.
s04e10	The Children	JAIME: Quickly now.
s04e10	The Children	[Tyrion takes a torch and uses a trap door to enter a room. There is a woman sleeping on a double bed, and we see the booch of the Hand of the King.]
s04e10	The Children	WOMAN: Tywin… my lion...
s04e10	The Children	[We see that the woman is Shae. She grabs a knife, and she and Tyrion struggle. Tyrion eventually strangles her with the bedclothes, weeping.]
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
s04e10	The Children	[Tyrion takes a crossbow from the wall and walks in on Tywin on the privy.]
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: All my life, you’ve wanted me dead.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: I loved her.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Who?
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: Shae.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: I murdered her. With my own hands.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: It doesn’t matter.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: It doesn’t matter?
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: She was a whore!
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: Say that word again.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: I can’t go back there. She’s in there.
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: What, are you afraid of a dead whore?
s04e10	The Children	[Tyrion fires the crossbow at Tywin.]
s04e10	The Children	TYWIN: You shot me. You’re no son of mine.
s04e10	The Children	TYRION: I am your son. I have always been your son.
s04e10	The Children	[Tyrion fires again.]
s04e10	The Children	VARYS: What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I’ve brought you this far.
s04e10	The Children	[Varys loads Tyrion, in a transport container, onto a ship. He goes to walk back to King's Landing, but turns around and boards the ship himself]
s04e10	The Children	CUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS
s04e10	The Children	[We go back to Arya, alone. She rides her horse to a small port.]
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: I want to see the captain.
s04e10	The Children	CAPTAIN: You’re seeing him.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: I want to go north, to the wall.
s04e10	The Children	CAPTAIN: No you don’t.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: I can pay.
s04e10	The Children	CAPTAIN: There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…
s04e10	The Children	CAPTAIN: I’m not going north, child, we’re going home.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Where’s home?
s04e10	The Children	CAPTAIN: The Free City of Braavos.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Wait, I have something else.
s04e10	The Children	CAPTAIN: More silver won’t make a difference.
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: It’s not silver, it’s iron.
s04e10	The Children	[Arya hands over the token she was given by Jaqen H'ghar.]
s04e10	The Children	ARYA: Valar morghulis.
s04e10	The Children	CAPTAIN: How did you… valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin.

s05e01	The Wars to Come	TITLE SEQUENCE
s05e01	The Wars to Come	EXT. WOODS
s05e01	The Wars to Come	A younger Cersei and her friend Melara are walking in the woods.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELARA: We shouldn’t be out here alone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Why not?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELARA: If your father hears…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: He’ll never know we’ve been gone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELARA: But if he finds out…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei takes her hands.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: You don’t need to be afraid of my father.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	They walk until they see a hut with smoke coming out of it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELARA: Are you sure?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Yes.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELARA: We shouldn’t go in.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Of course we should.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	INT. MAGGY’S HUT
s05e01	The Wars to Come	A fire is burning and various plants are hanging from the ceiling. They hear a shriek then…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: Get out. Get out!
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELARA: Let’s go…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: No.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: Listen to your friend.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: You don’t know what I am.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Maggy chuckles then hands Cersei a knife.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: Your blood. Give me a taste.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei cuts her thumb then Maggy grabs her hand to suck her blood.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: Three questions you get. You won’t like the answers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed the king.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: But I will be queen?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: Oh yes, you’ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Will the king and I have children?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: That doesn’t make sense.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MAGGY: Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Maggy starts laughing. Cersei’s thumb starts dripping blood.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELARA: Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CUT TO: CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei gets out of a cart to a funeral procession outside of the Great Sept of Baelor. She walks to the top of the stairs.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PRIEST: Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PRIEST: But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei starts walking away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PRIEST: From all seven kingdoms…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: They will wait.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Tywin’s body rests with hand-painted stones on top of his eyes. Jaime presides over the body. Cersei walks next to him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JAIME: What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They’re going to try to take it away, all of it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: They?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JAIME: All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JAIME: This is exactly what they want.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: ...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	No response from Jaime.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei kisses Tywin on the head then leaves.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	INT. CRATE - PENTOS
s05e01	The Wars to Come	We see men working with rope, merchants carrying boxes, and trees through a hole in the crate. The crate is set down and opened up. Tyrion comes out with Varys standing over him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: Apologies.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: No. I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Tyrion looks around.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Pentos?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Varys nods.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Tyrion pours himself a cup of wine and drinks it.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Much better.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: My lord?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: In a box. Why stop now?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: Because we are talking about the future of our country.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Tyrion finishes his wine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: The future is shit. Just like the past.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	He pukes up his wine and then pours himself another cup.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CUT TO: MEEREEN
s05e01	The Wars to Come	The giant bronze Harpy statue is pulled down from the top of the pyramid.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	EXT. BROTHEL - MEEREEN
s05e01	The Wars to Come	An Unsullied soldier, White Rat, walks up to a prostitute and hands her a coin. She takes him into her room and starts undressing him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PROSTITUTE: You want the same? Same as always?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	She undresses herself
s05e01	The Wars to Come	WHITE RAT: You… you don’t have to.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PROSTITUTE: Habit.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	She puts her clothes back on and lays down next to him in bed, stroking his head and humming. A knife slits his throat. White Rat looks up and sees a member of the Sons of the Harpy holding the knife
s05e01	The Wars to Come	INT. GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN
s05e01	The Wars to Come	A golden Sons of the Harpy mask rests on the table.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: Sons of the Harpy?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BARRISTAN: Yes, your grace. They left it on the body.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: They’ve never killed before.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BARRISTAN: It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MOSSADOR: They do not see us as people, Your Grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GREY WORM: White Rat, your grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BARRISTAN: The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MOSSADOR: Make them very angry.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	INT. HALLWAY
s05e01	The Wars to Come	The Unsullied are putting their armor on. Missandei walks up to Grey Worm.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MISSANDEI: Torgo Nudho.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GREY WORM: Missandei hin Naath.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MISSANDEI: I wanted to speak with you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	The other Unsullied leave the room.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GREY WORM: Why do you come?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MISSANDEI: White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GREY WORM: I do not know. I must go.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon Snow is parrying with Olly. Jon puts his sword to Olly’s neck.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Get your shield up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	OLLY: It’s too heavy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon knocks Olly into the ground then helps him up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I’ll ring your head like a bell.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Sam and Gilly are watching them parry from afar.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GILLY: Shouldn’t you be training, too?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SAM: Well, I’m hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Ser Alliser walks by.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	ALLISER: These men need a firm hand. Always have. They’re poachers and thieves.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	He gives Sam and Gilly a look.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	ALLISER: Not soldiers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	He walks away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GILLY: That one hates me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SAM: If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Sam looks at Gilly’s baby.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SAM: All the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GILLY: Don’t let them send us away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SAM: It’s not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he’s a good man. He’s running against Ser Alliser--
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GILLY: Sam! Don’t let them send us away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SAM: I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GILLY: You can’t leave, they’ll execute you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cut back to Jon and Olly parrying. Olly is on the offensive.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Good, good, pivot! Don’t forget to pivot! Shield up!
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon turns and sees Melisandre waiting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: The king wants a word.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	INT. ELEVATOR - THE WALL
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon looks uncomfortably at Melisandre.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: You’re not cold, my lady?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: Never. The Lord’s fire lives within me, Jon Snow.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	She takes his hand to her face.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: Feel.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon feels her face.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: Are you a virgin?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: No.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: Good.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	EXT. THE WALL
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon bows to Stannis. Stannis motions for him to get up.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: You know who rules at Winterfell now?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Roose Bolton.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart. Don’t you want to avenge him?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAVOS: I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: They’re good men.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAVOS: Many don’t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: It’s where she belonged.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAVOS: Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can’t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike. But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch. I’m talking about the wildlings.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAVOS: It’s a fair offer. More than fair.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: I don’t think that’s likely.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: You admire him, don’t you?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: I respect him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Your grace…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: ...or he burns.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: How much time do I have?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow.

s05e01	The Wars to Come	Sansa, Littlefinger, and Yohn Royce are watching Robin parry. He is being beaten badly.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MASTER OF ARMS: Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don’t cross your feet!
s05e01	The Wars to Come	YOHN ROYCE: My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	ROYCE: Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SQUIRE: My lord. (hands Baelish a note)
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MASTER OF ARMS (O.S.): Sword up, my lord!
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: Some boys develop more slowly. He’s still young.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	ROYCE: He’s 13. Boys go to war at 13.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: He has other gifts.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	ROYCE: Does he?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: The gift of a great name. Sometimes that’s all one needs.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	He offers his hand to Sansa and takes her away from the swordfight. Lord Royce follows.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SANSA: Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you’ve done for me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	ROYCE: I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin’s skills will have improved immeasurably.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	ROYCE: He’ll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CUT TO: COUNTRYSIDE
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Podrick sits down next to Brienne, who is sharpening her sword.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PODRICK: Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We’re a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BRIENNE: Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PODRICK: But I’m you’re squire.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BRIENNE: Do you even know what a squire is?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PODRICK: An attendant to a knight?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BRIENNE: I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PODRICK: Well, where would I go?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BRIENNE: I don’t care, I’m not your mother.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PODRICK: You swore to find the Stark girls.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BRIENNE: I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	PODRICK: Sansa still might.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BRIENNE: Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	A horse and carriage rides by.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	INT. CARRIAGE
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SANSA: You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: I did.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SANSA: But we’re heading west.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: We are.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SANSA: If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SANSA: No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Baelish smiles.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: No. But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	SANSA: So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	BAELISH: So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you.

s05e01	The Wars to Come	Close-up on Cersei drinking wine while Loras talks in the background.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cut to Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI (sighs): Thank you so much for your kind words.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei walks away and heads down the stairs.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	GRAND MAESTER PYRCELLE: Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei walks away from him. A barefooted man in a robe walks up to Cersei.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LANCEL LANNISTER: Your grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei inspects him for a moment.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LANCEL: My deepest sympathies.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	KEVAN LANNISTER: I apologize for my son’s appearance.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Uncle, it’s quite alright.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Lancel walks away.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	KEVAN: They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	KEVAN: Of course.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei walks away, grabs a glass of wine, and heads to a room alone. Lancel greets her after some time.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LANCEL: It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: What can I do for you?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LANCEL: You can forgive me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LANCEL: I led you into the darkness.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LANCEL: I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LANCEL: I’m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father’s soul.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei laughs.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	CERSEI: The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help…
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Cersei takes a sip of wine and Lancel walks away.

s05e01	The Wars to Come	OLYVAR: It looks like Dorne.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: No it doesn’t.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	OLYVAR: It does. That’s the Sunspear bit right there. And that’s where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: Sandstone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	OLYVAR: Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: Fine.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	They start kissing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: It’s Dorne.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	OLYVAR: We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	They kiss. Margaery walks in.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: We’re late for dinner as it is.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: You’re very respectful.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: I’m very hungry.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	She closes the door.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: What’s your name?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	OLYVAR: Olyvar, my lady.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Olyvar kisses Loras then leaves the room.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: In any event… (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: My intended? Please. Tywin’s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: Lucky you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: Unlucky you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: You think I want that woman married to my brother?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King’s Landing. Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MARGAERY: Perhaps.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	LORAS: Perhaps?

s05e01	The Wars to Come	Tyrion raises his glass.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: There are faster ways to kill yourself.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Not for a coward.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: You never told me why you set me free.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: Your brother asked me to.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: You could have said no.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: I’m not well-suited for work.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: I never said you were perfect.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: What is it you want exactly?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Good luck finding him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	VARYS: Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	TYRION: Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?

s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ: The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: Good.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR: They did ask for some concessions.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: Concessions?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR: Politics is the art of compromise, your grace.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR: Forgive me. You’re right, of course. Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR: They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR: In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Daario takes out his sword and smiles at Daenerys.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR: The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: No fighting pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	HIZDAHR: Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.

s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAARIO: You should reopen the fighting pits.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: What?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAARIO: My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: Why?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAARIO: I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAARIO: I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	A long pause.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAARIO: You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAARIO (scoffs): Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	DAENERYS: I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.

s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: You know what Stannis wants?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much: he’s bold.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Shouldn’t a king be bold?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I’ll never serve him.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: That’s right. But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn’t about that.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: Then bend the knee and save your people.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: They’ll burn you alive.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: Bad way to go. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die. And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it’s better than betraying everything I believe.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: You’re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon walks to the door, then turns around.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	JON: I think you’re making a terrible mistake.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Jon nods then leaves the room.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	EXT. CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Members of the Night’s Watch escort Mance to Stannis.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Mance looks at the Free Folk, including Tormund, the Night’s Watch have chained up. Then he looks at Jon Snow.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	STANNIS: Kneel and live.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MANCE: This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	Stannis nods. His men take Mance onto the burning funeral pyre and tie him to it. Melisandre walks to the front of the pyre.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	She picks up a torch.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	MELISANDRE: Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.
s05e01	The Wars to Come	She lights the pyre. Mance starts panicking as the fire reaches his legs. Jon Snow walks up to a high point and shoots Mance in the heart with an arrow, killing him.

s05e02	The House of Black and White	Arya approaches the coast in the boat she boarded in the Season 4 finale. The Titan of Braavos looms over the ship.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRAAVOSI MAN: In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: He's just a statue.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	A horn blows as they approach the statue. Arya clutches her chest and the man laughs.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MAN: Don't be afraid. He’s announcing our arrival.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: I'm not afraid.

s05e02	The House of Black and White	Arya and the man are in a row boat. The man rows them to shore as they pass various street merchants. The man rows past them and The House of Black and White comes into view.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MAN: The House of Black and White: this is where you'll find the man you seek.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	EXT. BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s05e02	The House of Black and White	They arrive at The House of Black and White
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MAN: Here, I leave you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	He helps Arya get off the boat and onto the dock.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Thank you for bringing me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MAN: Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Valar dohaeris.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Arya knocks on the door, twice; the door opens while knocking the second time. An old man enters
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Hello. Valar Morghulis.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The old man continues to stare; Arya takes out the coin.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Jaqen H’ghar gave me this.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	OLD MAN: No one here by that name.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The old man is about to close the door before Arya interrupts.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	OLD MAN: You have everywhere else to go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: But wait!

s05e02	The House of Black and White	Brienne rides into the stable outside the inn on horseback, with Podrick walking next to her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: Must be good food if it’s crowded.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. THE VALE - INN
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Podrick and Brienne are seated at a table. A waitress approaches.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	WAITRESS: Ale? (pours ale and leaves table; goes to another table) Ale?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Cut to another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: You are becoming an observant young lady.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: My mother used to say, "dark wings, dark words".
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: So it was good news.?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: My marriage proposal has been accepted.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	WAITRESS: Ale?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: I'll have some.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Back to Podrick and Brienne
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: My lady!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: What is it?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: Sansa Stark. (Brienne begins to turn around) Don't look!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: You sure?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Littlefinger?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: A bunch of knights with him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: 10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Ready the horses.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: We only have one horse.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Find more.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Podrick gets up and leaves
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: Do you like the taste?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: It gives some men courage.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: Does it give you courage?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Brienne shows up and Baelish's knights get in her way
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GUARD: That's far enough.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, "You're a loyalty comes free of charge." Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Baelish gestures to the knights to welcome her; Brienne goes through and takes a knee in front of Sansa
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: I was.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: It was after Renly's murder.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: I tried to save him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: But you were accused.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: By men who didn't see what happened.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: Then what did happen?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Why should you have any say in her affairs?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: No.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Please, my lady. If I could explain--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SANSA: And sometimes we do. You should leave.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BAELISH: We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Brienne walks away
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KNIGHT 1: He asked you to stay.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Brienne elbows him in the face after Knight 1 and Knight 2 attempt to get in her way. Brienne rushes out of the inn to the stables. She frees some horses then rides away with Podrick.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GUARD: After her!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	EXT. VALE - WOODS
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The knights chase after Brienne and Podrick. Podrick and Brienne separate.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Podrick! (Podrick screams as he loses control of the horse)
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Podrick gets away from the knights and stops at a river
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: Stop, stop, stop! (Horse stops) That’s a good boy.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Podrick turnsthe horse around and he loses control again, only this time he falls off the horse. He tries to run after it, but stops.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Enter knight, who sees Podrick. Podrick sees him and throws a rock at him and misses.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KNIGHT: I guess that means you’re unarmed.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Knight pulls out his sword and races towards Podrick.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Down, Podrick, down!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Podrick gets down. Brienne slices the knight off his horse before he can get to Podrick. Another knight on a horse rushes towards her, and she stabs him in the neck.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Podrick?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: Yes, my lady?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: You can stand now.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We’ll follow them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: If they don’t want your protection--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PODRICK: (pause) No, my lady.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRIENNE: Get your horse.

s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: A summons from the queen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Cersei looks farefully at a box on her desk. Jaime opens it, and a viper with a necklace in its mouth comes out. Jaime inspects the necklace; it has the Lannister lion on it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: There are only two like it in the world: the one I’m wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: It’s a threat.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) "It's a threat."
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: No note.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: Softer.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: What?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: Not so loud.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: I’ll make things better.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: You never made anything better.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: I’m not going to ask him anything.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: You go there with an army, it’s an act of war.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: (scoffs) You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?

We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Bronn has been skipping stones and ignoring her.

s05e02	The House of Black and White	LOLLYS: You won't.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: Pardon?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	LOLLYS: We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: Oh.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	LOLLYS: She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	LOLLYS: She is.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	They stop walking. Bronn looks at someone in the distance.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	LOLLYS: Who's that?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jaime is sitting on a stone wall, waiting for Bronn.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: Jaime fucking Lannister.

s05e02	The House of Black and White	Lollys starts walking back to the Castle.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: Just get on with it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: On with what?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: It's very good for you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jaime goes into his coat and pulls out a scroll. He hands it to Bronn.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: Mmm.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: We made a deal, your sister and I.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: I would have advised against that.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BRONN: How is this good for me?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAIME: 'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle.

s05e02	The House of Black and White	Ellaria glowers from the balcony at Trystane Martell escorting Myrcella through the Water Gardens. Trystane looks up and sees her. Ellaria walks towards Doran's place on the balcony and is blocked by Areo Hotah.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	AREO: The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DORAN: Captain. Let her pass.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Areo reluctantly steps to the side. Ellaria approaches Prince Doran, staring at the Water Gardens from his wheelchair.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DORAN: Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: Your brother--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DORAN: You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: What will you do about his death.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DORAN: I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

s05e02	The House of Black and White	DORAN: You would have me go to war?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: The whole country would have you go to war.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DORAN: Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Doran says nothing. Cut back to Trystane and Myrcella in the Water Gardens.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Let me have her. Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DORAN: I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ELLARIA: And how long will that be?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Ellaria exits the room. Areo goes back to guarding the door. Doran shakes his head.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	EXT. MEEREEN - STREET
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The Unsullied march through the street.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO (O.S.): The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Daario and Grey Worm are walking through an alley together.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Grey Worm grunts a "no".
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it...
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Daario has brought them to a door. Grey Worm knocks it in and rushes the room. He, Daario, and an Unsullied inspect the room quietly.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GREY WORM: No one here. We go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: In a hurry? You're afraid?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GREY WORM: Unsullied fear nothing.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Daario quickly pulls a dagger out, and stabs into a wall covered by a bookcase that immediately gives way. A man screams and falls out of the wall.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: Fear is useful that way.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	He pats Grey Worm on the shoulder. The Unsullied soldier grabs the man. Grey Worm searches the hiding place and finds daggers laying on the ground with a Sons of the Harpy mask.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. MEEREEN - PYRAMID
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: It would send a message.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: Why?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: For one thing, he may have valuable information.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: How do you know that?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: Because I questioned him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	HIZDAHR: And the information you did get, he is young and poor.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: He is born free.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	HIZDAHR: Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	HIZDAHR: And how do you know this?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: Everyone knows this.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	HIZDAHR: I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: We do not know what this man did or didn't do. (to Daenerys) Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial: these mean nothing to them. All they understand is blood!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	They all look to Daenerys.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: Thank you all for your counsel.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Everyone gets up from the table and exits the room besides Ser Barristan.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: About what?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: About your father. About the Mad King.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first.  Your enemies did not lie.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: Go on.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: I'm not my father.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN (nods): Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: There's a bug.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: You don't like it?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: I want to take a walk.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: The road to Meereen.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: I told you. A ruler.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: I didn't rule. I was a servant.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: Still, a man of talent.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: Managed to kill a lot of people.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: Why?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: 'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine)
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: I find us repulsive.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: You're right. Let's go for a walk.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	VARYS: No.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	TYRION: How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM
s05e02	The House of Black and White	A dwarf head is placed on her desk.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: Not him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MERYN: Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	HUNTERS: Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: Take the head.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	QYBURN: Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: Very good.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	She and Qyburn exit the room.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	QYBURN: Over there will be fine.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MERYN (to hunters): You heard the man. Over there.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The hunters pick up the dwarf head.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Cersei and Qyburn enter the room, taking the open seats on the small council. Cersei sits at the head of the table.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KEVAN: You're the Hand of the King?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MACE TYRELL: Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MACE: Oh, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MACE: The honor is all mine, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PYCELLE: Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PYCELLE: Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	PYCELLE: I must say I cannot see--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI (cutting him off): Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KEVAN: That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: The king is very busy at this moment.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KEVAN: He should be here, learning what it means to rule.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KEVAN: I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KEVAN: What mission?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: That is not your concern as Master of War.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KEVAN: I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Kevan gets up from his seat.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CERSEI: You would abandon your king in his time of need?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	KEVAN: If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	He exits the room and closes the door.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Shireen runs her finger over the letter "S" in her book.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY: Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Right, very good!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Sam is reading in a different aisle in the library.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Gilly and Shireen look to him and then back at their book.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY: I know "S".
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY: Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY: That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Sam goes back to his book.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY (to Shireen): How old were you when you learned to read?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Three.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM (interjecting): Three?! Who taught you, your mother?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off)
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY (gently): What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY: I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY: My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: Did you ever see them?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GILLY: Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: What did he do to them in the woods?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Gilly is afraid to answer. Selyse enters the room before she can.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Mother.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SELYSE (to Sam and Gilly): Leave us.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM (nodding): Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Sam and Gilly exit the room.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SELYSE: You need to stay away from that girl.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Why?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SELYSE: She's a wildling.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SELYSE: She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHIREEN: Gilly wouldn't do that.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SELYSE: You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Selyse exits the library.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: Who then? You?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: No. Only one of their own.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: The Lord Commander's niece.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: "Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark." (Jon smiles)
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: That amuses you?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAVOS: Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: Most likely.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAVOS: Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: Unpleasant, I expect.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: You can give me the North.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	STANNIS: Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jon stares at Stannis deeply without saying a word.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: I'm going to refuse him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM (confused): But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JON: I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jon walks away from Sam and takes a seat.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ALLISER (O.S.): Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Maester Aemon rises slowly from the table at the front.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	AEMON: Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Janos Slynt stands up.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JANOS: Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MEN: Hear, hear.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JANOS: He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Alliser smiles. Men cheer and beat on the tables.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	AEMON: Is there anyone else?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SHADOW TOWER BROTHER: Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Men, including Jon, bang their cups on the table, but the reaction is much weaker.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	AEMON: If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: Maester Aemon.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Every Brother, including Jon, look to Sam at the back of the room in shock.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	AEMON: Samwell Tarly. Go on.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jon shakes his head "no" at Sam.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JANOS (O.S.): Sam the Slayer.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The whole room laughs.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JANOS: Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	More laughs.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The men start laughing at Janos now.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JANOS: Lies!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Stronger laughter. Maester Aemon cracks a smile.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The men go quiet.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	SAM: Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The men give Jon a strong cheer.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ALLISER: I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jon doesn't respond. Maester Aemon rises again.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	AEMON: It is time.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Brothers of the Night's Watch walk to the front of the room, placing their tokens into a jar. A brother breaks the jar and counts the tokens. Alliser and Jon have the same amount of tokens.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BROTHER: It appears to be a tie, Maester.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Maester Aemon rises once more, feels each stack of tokens to determine which is which, and casts his own vote for Jon. The men near Alliser look angry. The men grouped around Mallister are content. Everyone else cheers.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BROTHERS: Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jon rises, sees Alliser glaring at him, and lets out a small smile for the first time since he entered the room.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	EXT. BRAAVOS - STREETS
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Arya creeps up on a pigeon in an alleyway and cuts its head off with Needle. She walks down the street with the pigeon in a pouch and Needle dangling from her hip. Three men walk by, see Needle, and approach her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MAN: You. You!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Arya stops and turns around to face them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MAN: What have you got there?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Arya doesn't respond.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MAN: I said--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Man: That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that. (pulls out his own sword)
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The man approaches her with his sword, but then sees the Old Man from the House of Black and White walking towards the altercation and backs off.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MEN: Quickly, go, go!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	They flee. The man looks at Arya then begins walking away.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	EXT. BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The Old Man leads Arya back to the doorstep.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	OLD MAN: You lost this.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	He tosses Arya her coin, then reaches to his face, pulls it off, and reveals the face of Jaqen H'ghar
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAQEN: There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	He begins to head back inside the House of Black and White.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	ARYA: Well who are you then?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	He turns back around.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	JAQEN: No one. And that is who a girl must become.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Jaqen opens the door and waits for Arya. After a moment, she follows him into the House of Black and White. The door closes behind them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. MEEREEN - PRISON
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Mossador is let into the Son of the Harpy's cell. The guards hold him up for Mossador.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	HARPY (Valyrian): She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her "Mhysa", she will never be your mother.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Mossador stares at him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	EXT. MEEREEN - STREET - DAY
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The Harpy is displayed in the street with his mask on, but the eye holes are cut out. A knife is in his stomach and skull, and "Kill the Masters" is written in blood on the wall next to the body.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. MEEREEN - PALACE
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: Why?
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR (Valyrian): For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSADOR: --and now you are the law!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: The law is the law. Take him.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Two Unsullieds carry Mossador out of the room.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	EXT. MEEREEN - DAY
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The Unsullied escort Daenerys and her small council. A large crowd surrounds them.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CROWD: Mhysa! Myhsa!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	They settle in front of the courthouse, surrounded by both former Masters and former slaves. The Unsullied form a ring around her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	HIZDAHR (to Daario): She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAARIO: Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The former slaves continues to yell to their Mhysa while the masters leer at her.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS (Valyrian, to crowd): You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Mossador is carried into the scene by Unsullied and set before Daenerys on his knees.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CROWD (Valyrian): Brother! Brother!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR (Valyrian): Mhysa, please! Forgive me!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS (Valyrian): A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CROWD (Valyrian): Mercy! Mercy!
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Mossador looks to Daenerys, pleading. She looks to Daario and nods. He takes out his arakh, walks to Mossador, and puts it to his neck. The crowd starts protesting and the Masters look on uncertainly.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	MOSSADOR: Mhysa... (prays in Valyrian)
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The crowd begs and pleads for mercy. Daenerys stares out to the crowd, then gives a nod to Daario, who swiftly decapitates Mossador.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	CROWD: Mhysa...
s05e02	The House of Black and White	The crowd goes silent. Suddenly, they start hissing at Daenerys. The Unsullied brace themselves. A former slave throws a rock at a former Master, and the Unsullied attempt to hold back the fight. Barristan and Grey Worm escort Missandei and Daenerys away from the crowd. The Unsullied cover her with their shields.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Former slaves and masters begin killing each other in the streets. Rocks are thrown at the Unsullied shields in attempts to hit Daenerys.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID
s05e02	The House of Black and White	BARRISTAN: I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	GREY WORM: We all guard tonight.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS: Leave me.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	Barristan, Daario, Missandei, and Grey Worm leave the room. Daenerys hears a noise coming from outside, and goes out on her balcony to investigate.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	When she's out she hears a soft growl, and turns to see Drogon, perched on the top of the pyramid and close to fully grown.
s05e02	The House of Black and White	DAENERYS (shocked): Drogon...
s05e02	The House of Black and White	He slowly climbs down to her balcony. Daenerys extends her hand. Drogon sniffs it hesitantly, and then takes off into the night, soaring over Meereen.

s05e03	High Sparrow	CUT TO: BRAAVOS
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s05e03	High Sparrow	Water drips down a statue of a woman with her eyes closed. Two more statues are shown, a lion sitting in a throne, and a rams head. Behind a large heart surrounded by gold flames, a glowing fire can be seen. A statue of a knight is shown, then a statue of a king’s face. A statue of a contorted tree is covered in a hair-like substance. There is a large pit filled with liquid in the center of the room. Arya can be heard, and then seen, sweeping. The waif carries a bucket past her. Sitting on the edge of the pit, Jaqen whisper to a man. Arya looks up and watches as Jaqen scoops up a cup of liquid from the pit, and hands it to the man. The man looks up at Jaqen, and hesitates before taking it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MAN: Valar morghulis.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: Valar dohaeris.
s05e03	High Sparrow	The man drinks the liquid, and watches as he approaches the statue of the woman with her eyes closed. He kneels down in front of it. Arya puts her broom down and approaches Jaqen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: I've been sweeping this floor for days.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: Good.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: I didn't come here to sweep floors.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: No? Why come, then?
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away).
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Jaqen leaves. Arya looks down at the man who had been kneeling. He is lying on his back, dead. Two men come into the room with a stretcher. They places the man’s body on it and begin walking to an open door at the end of the room. The waif walks past Arya.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: Where are they taking him?
s05e03	High Sparrow	The waif doesn’t respond, but continues walking. Arya turns to watch as the door closes behind the men carrying the stretcher.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CUT TO: KING’S LANDING
s05e03	High Sparrow	EXT. STREET
s05e03	High Sparrow	Bells are ringing, and people are cheering and shouting. Many are on the sides of the road, waving as a number of carriages are carried past.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BYSTANDERS: Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
s05e03	High Sparrow	Inside her carriage, Cersei watches the people on the street, a sullen look on her face. She closes her curtains.
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. GREAT SEPT
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY & TOMMEN: I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tommen and Margaery share a kiss. Cersei watches them from the crowd, emotionless. The newlyweds turn to the crowd, holding hands. Everyone claps. They smile and laugh. Cersei claps as well, and forces herself to smile.
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tommen breathes heavily as he and Margaery finish having sex. She turns onto her side and smiles.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: Did I hurt you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: No. You were lovely.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: It all happened so fast.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Yes. (Chuckles).
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: So strange… Husband.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Margaery looks at him curiously. He suddenly sits up.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: Do you like to sail?
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: (Sits up). I love to sail.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: I do, too.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: I do, too.
s05e03	High Sparrow	She kisses him and turns around. She gets up, wrapping a bedsheet around herself as a cover.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: Well, but I'm a man now.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: I suppose.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.
s05e03	High Sparrow	EXT. CASTLE WALL
s05e03	High Sparrow	Cersei and Tommen walk together, her arm around his. A group of guards walk behind them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: (Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: I want you to be happy, mother.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TOMMEN: But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. ROOM
s05e03	High Sparrow	Cersei approaches a room with two guards. Inside, Margaery is having tea with some of her friends.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: I said, "Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?" (Laugher). And he said, "Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."
s05e03	High Sparrow	Margaery’s friends laugh. As Cersei walks in, they all get up and bow.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: You are very sweet.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery’s friends laugh).
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: There's no need for such formalities.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Won’t that be a lovely day.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MARGAERY: Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Remember. Anything you need.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Margaery smiles. Cersei leaves. Margaery’s smile fades. It returns when her friends begin laughing, and she turns back around. Cersei walks away with her two guards, still able to hear the laughter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s05e03	High Sparrow	EXT. COURTYARD
s05e03	High Sparrow	A horse whinnies. Bolton bannermen ride to the keep. In the keep, a number of workmen are busy building and repairing things. Some men carry some raven cages through the middle of the courtyard. Theon, carrying a dead bird, walks through for a moment. He then comes across some soldiers lifting up some flayed bodies with rope. He becomes very tense and forces himself to keep walking, head down. A raven picks at a body in a cart.
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. DINING HALL
s05e03	High Sparrow	Roose and Ramsay sit at a table as Theon cuts some food. Ramsay talks with his face stuffed.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: We can't hold the North with terror alone.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Theon holds the food in front of Ramsay. He takes some of it and puts it on his plate.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: He left you no choice.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: And?
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: (After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Ramsay, who had been heavily engrossed in his eating, stops suddenly and looks up. Theon slowly puts down a plate nearby. Ramsay puts down his silverware and sits back, looking at his father.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN
s05e03	High Sparrow	EXT. NEARBY HILLS
s05e03	High Sparrow	Sansa, Baelish, and a number of knights ride towards Moat Cailin. The party stops. Baelish leads Sansa on foot to a spot where they can easily overlook the keep. The keep is shown, surrounded by swampy riverlands.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: That's Moat Cailin.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Home.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: (Shakes his head). No.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: He did.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: He serves the Lannisters.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: For now.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: I won't go.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Winterfell is your home.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: Not anymore.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: No!
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Sansa -
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: (Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	He kisses her forehead. He walks back to their horses. After a few moments, she regains her composure and gets on her horse. The party starts moving again. On top of a large hill nearby, Brienne and Podrick watch as the party arrives at the keep.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: How do we get through there?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
s05e03	High Sparrow	EXT. CAMPSITE
s05e03	High Sparrow	Podrick sits scrubbing a boot.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: He hates that nickname.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?
s05e03	High Sparrow	Podrick finishes scrubbing and hands the boot to Brienne. He puts the brush down. Brienne begins putting the boot on.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: He borrowed it?
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: As punishment. For both of you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: (Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: You want to be a knight, Pod?
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: Yes.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: I suppose that's more important.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Podrick leans over the campfire with some rocks. He strikes them together until he gets a spark, and blows until the fire starts going. He wipes himself off and stands up, walking over to Brienne. He begins taking her armor off.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: I was.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: He was.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: But how did you end up serving Renly?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: (After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PODRICK: But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.

s05e03	High Sparrow	Olly opens the door for Stannis and Davos. Jon sits at his desk.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: Lord Commander.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: (Stands up). Your Grace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: (To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: Say the word and you will be.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: I can imagine no higher praise.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: Are you bored of us already?
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: And the wildlings?
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him).
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Stannis begins to leave. Olly opens the door.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
s05e03	High Sparrow	STANNIS: Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Stannis leaves. Davos begins to leave, but turns to Jon as Jon begins to pace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	DAVOS: He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: I'm sorry I disappointed him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Davos walks forward and takes a seat. Olly closes the door again.
s05e03	High Sparrow	DAVOS: The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: As long as he's ruling them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	DAVOS: He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e03	High Sparrow	DAVOS: Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Olly looks to Jon. Jon looks at him, crosses his arms, and nods.
s05e03	High Sparrow	OLLY: Night gathers and now my watch begins -
s05e03	High Sparrow	DAVOS: Not that bit, the bit at the end.
s05e03	High Sparrow	OLLY: I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -
s05e03	High Sparrow	DAVOS: Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: And what needs to be done?
s05e03	High Sparrow	DAVOS: As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Davos nods and turns to leave. Olly opens the door for him. Jon sits at his desk and sighs.

s05e03	High Sparrow	Arya lays on her bed, playing with her coin in her hand. Suddenly, the door opens, and she sits up. The waif enters with a cane, and begins pacing.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: What do you want?
s05e03	High Sparrow	WAIF: Who are you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: What?
s05e03	High Sparrow	WAIF: You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: (After a moment, perks up). No one.
s05e03	High Sparrow	The waif quickly swings her cane at Arya, hitting her arm. Arya, now on her feet, turns to face the waif, holding her arm in pain.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: Ow! Cunt!
s05e03	High Sparrow	WAIF: A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and -
s05e03	High Sparrow	The waif hits her a third time, sending her to the ground.
s05e03	High Sparrow	WAIF: Who are you?
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: You're about to find out.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Arya reaches for her sword. Before she can pick it up, Jaqen appears.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: What are you doing?
s05e03	High Sparrow	WAIF: We were only playing. The game of faces.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: A girl is not ready.
s05e03	High Sparrow	WAIF: Clearly not.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: (Stands up). I am ready.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
s05e03	High Sparrow	The waif turns to her. Jaqen looks at the sword on Arya’s bed.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JAQEN: Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?
s05e03	High Sparrow	The waif, looking smug, leaves.
s05e03	High Sparrow	EXT. DOCK
s05e03	High Sparrow	On a dock near the house of Black and White, Arya wraps a rock in her clothes. She is wearing new clothes, similar to the ones the waif wears. She ties them up and drops them into the water, the rock causing them to sink. She picks up her coin purse and throws it in the water. After a moment of examining her original coin in her hand, she throws it in the water as well. She looks at her sword Needle for a moment, and then picks it up. She prepares to throw it in the sea, but finds herself unable to, and begins to sob. She turns and walks over to some nearby rocks, and hides the sword under some of them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s05e03	High Sparrow	Arya is again sweeping the floor in the main room. She notices the men from the beginning of the episode carrying another dead body into the back room. However, after a moment, she realizes that she didn’t hear the door close, and she looks up to find it wide open. Jaqen surprises her by suddenly putting his hand on her shoulder. He nods towards the door, and begins walking over to it. Arya follows him, leaving the broom outside. They go down a fire-lit tunnel. Jaqen opens the door at the end of the tunnel to reveal a chamber. Inside, the waif stands motionless next to a large stone slab. On it is the dead man. Jaqen leaves through the back door. After Jaqen closes the door, the waif begins to remove the dead man’s clothes. She looks up at Arya, who walks over and begins to do so as well. The waif inspects his body. She wets a rag and begins cleaning off the man.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ARYA: What do we do with them after we wash them?
s05e03	High Sparrow	The waif only looks up and smiles lightly, making no other response. She goes back to washing him, and Arya wets a rag of her own to help.

Baelish gets off of his horse. Roose, Ramsay, and Walda watch as Sansa gets off hers. Roose walks forward. Baelish leads Sansa towards him, rubbing her hands.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: Lady Sansa, welcome.
s05e03	High Sparrow	After a tense moment, Sansa smiles and curtsies.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: (Smiles). Lord Bolton.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?
s05e03	High Sparrow	Ramsay smiles and walks forwards, removing his gloves. Sansa smiles at him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: It's an honor to meet you, my Lady.
s05e03	High Sparrow	He takes her hand and kisses it. Nearby, Myranda and other women watch.

s05e03	High Sparrow	SANSA: Thank you.

s05e03	High Sparrow	Jon sits at a table, tapping his fingers anxiously. The men in the room talk amongst themselves.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?
s05e03	High Sparrow	SAM: He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Everyone laughs. Some of the men jokingly pat Brian on his back, and Brian laughs as well.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Some of the men shout in approval. Alliser looks up surprised. Edd and Sam look at each other. Janos pats him on the shoulder.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JANOS: (Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -
s05e03	High Sparrow	JANOS: I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Some of the men begin talking loudly. Olly shifts in his seat.
s05e03	High Sparrow	SAM: Alright, alright! Enough of that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JANOS: (Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Are you refusing to obey my order?
s05e03	High Sparrow	The men in the room all turn to look at Janos.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JANOS: You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Some of the men whisper in shock. Janos looks pleased with himself. Alliser turns to Jon smugly.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Take Lord Janos outside.
s05e03	High Sparrow	The men begin to stand up. Janos scoffs.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: Olly, bring me my sword.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Olly turns quickly to Jon, then gets up. Janos looks more unsure of himself as more men get up. Alliser turns and looks at Janos disapprovingly. Edd walks over to get Janos. Alliser stands in his way for a moment. Jon looks at the confrontation, worried. Alliser raises his eyebrows for a moment and moves out of the way. Janos looks at him shocked. Edd grabs Janos, and some other men assist in dragging him outside.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JANOS: You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Someone puts a chopping block down. Janos is taken up to it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JANOS: A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!
s05e03	High Sparrow	Jon takes a final sip of his wine, gets up, and goes outside. The watchmen all gather in the courtyard. Olly hands Jon his sword. Jon walks up to where Janos is being held. Stannis watches from afar. Jon unsheathes his sword, and Janos looks up at it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JON: If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JANOS: (Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Janos sobs for a few moments. Jon hesitates, and then brings his sword down, decapitating Janos. He hands his sword to a watchman standing nearby. He looks up and makes eye contact with Stannis.

s05e03	High Sparrow	Olyvar snaps his fingers. He and five of the prostitutes step aside. The two dressed as the Maiden and the Stranger remain and approach the High Septon, who smiles. Suddenly, some men led by Lancel Lannister barge into the room. The High Septon gasps and turns around.

s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SEPTON: As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: You were assaulted?
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SEPTON: I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.
s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MACE: High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SEPTON: I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.
s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: What do you want from us, High Septon?
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SEPTON: Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -

s05e03	High Sparrow	In the center of the room, an old man is giving soup to people in line. Cersei approaches him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SPARROW: High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.
s05e03	High Sparrow	WOMAN 2: Seven blessings to you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SPARROW: Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line).
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Why no shoes?
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SPARROW: Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SPARROW: Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: (Smiles). Perhaps they're right.
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SPARROW: It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SPARROW: Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	HIGH SPARROW: I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: (After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. QYBURN’S LAB
s05e03	High Sparrow	Qyburn pulls a rat out of a cage. He brings it over to a desk and holds a knife above it. The camera switches to his face, and blood splatters onto a protective lens. Cersei enters the room with a letter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: Your Grace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter).
s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk).
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: How's your work coming along?
s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: Very well.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: You've made progress?
s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…
s05e03	High Sparrow	CERSEI: Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediately".
s05e03	High Sparrow	Cersei leaves the room. Qyburn begins writing something down. Behind him on a table is a large object, covered by a sheet. After a few moments of writing, the object begins violently jerking around, and then stops.
s05e03	High Sparrow	QYBURN: Shh. Easy, friend.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s05e03	High Sparrow	COURTYARD
s05e03	High Sparrow	Sansa walks through the busy courtyard. Theon is shoveling dirt nearby. He looks up to see her walking in his direction, and looks away, tense. On a platform above, Ramsay and Baelish stand, watching her.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She’s suffered enough.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: (Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
s05e03	High Sparrow	RAMSAY: Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows).
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: He seems pleased.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: Shouldn't he be?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: (They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: The Queen will be enraged.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BAELISH: The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.
s05e03	High Sparrow	ROOSE: I'd like to read the reply.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Roose walks away.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CUT TO: VOLANTIS
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tyrion repeatedly opens and closes a window.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: Volantis is a large city.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: (Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: It's a perfectly good face.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: I'm losing my mind.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tyrion knocks on the front of the carriage. The camera then pans over part of the city. Varys and Tyrion walk through a busy marketplace.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Slaves.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Varys and Tyrion arrive at a clearing in the market and stop. A woman speaks before a large crowd.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) Lord cast your light upon us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CROWD: (Valyrian, in unison) Lord cast your light upon us.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: (Aside) We should keep moving.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Noticing Tyrion is no longer next to him, he frantically looks around.
s05e03	High Sparrow	CROWD: (Valyrian, in unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) I was once as you are now.
s05e03	High Sparrow	The woman points to her cheek. Tyrion watches from some nearby steps, and drinks some wine.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) Bought and sold, (Varys approaches Tyrion), scourged and branded...
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
s05e03	High Sparrow	PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).
s05e03	High Sparrow	PRIESTESS: (Valyrian) He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
s05e03	High Sparrow	The priestess slowly turns her head to lock eyes with Tyrion.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: (Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.
s05e03	High Sparrow	They return to the marketplace and continue walking. They stop at a large door, which a man is guarding. He rubs Tyrion’s head.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MAN: (Valyrian) It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Varys rolls his eyes, exasperated. The man stares at him unamused.
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT. BROTHEL
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Elsewhere in the brothel, Jorah sets his cup down. Tyrion and Varys sit down at a table, and a woman comes to bring them wine.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: Thank you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tyrion clinks his glass against Varys’s. A prostitute dressed as Daenerys walks through the brothel. Tyrion looks at her.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Curious... hair. (She looks at him).
s05e03	High Sparrow	MAN: (Across the room). The mother of dragons!
s05e03	High Sparrow	He gestures for her to come over. She approaches their table.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Jorah watches the prostitute, and then looks away.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
s05e03	High Sparrow	MAN: What makes you worth that much?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLONDE PROSTITUTE: I’m magic. (They laugh).
s05e03	High Sparrow	MAN: I bet you bloody are.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Jorah listens to this, appearing extremely uncomfortable.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tyrion spots another prostitute, with shorter dark hair. He gets up.
s05e03	High Sparrow	VARYS: Where're you going?
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: I need to speak to someone with hair.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tyrion approaches the black haired prostitute.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Hello?
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Hello.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: You've got no drink.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You've got no money.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	The blonde prostitute and the man giggle. Tyrion glances over at them.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: That’s because they’ve never met a queen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You're just saying that.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Why?
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Because you have a skeptical mind.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: (Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. We’re gonna have to wash you first.
s05e03	High Sparrow	She takes his hand, but Tyrion doesn’t get up.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Come on.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: (After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Of course you can. You're shy.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: I'm not.
s05e03	High Sparrow	BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Have another drink.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start.
s05e03	High Sparrow	She looks confused. Tyrion walks away. Varys, noticing that Tyrion is no longer in his view, gets up worriedly.
s05e03	High Sparrow	INT./EXT. WINDOW
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tyrion pisses out of a window, and sips his wine. He throws the cup out into the water below. He notices that someone is behind him.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see it’s not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Jorah looks behind him. As Tyrion pulls up his pants, Jorah puts a rope around him and begins tying it.
s05e03	High Sparrow	TYRION: You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
s05e03	High Sparrow	Jorah puts a rag over Tyrion’s mouth.
s05e03	High Sparrow	JORAH: I'm taking you to the Queen.
s05e03	High Sparrow	Tyrion’s eyes widen. Jorah picks him up and leaves.
s05e03	High Sparrow	END EPISODE
s05e03	High Sparrow	An unofficial script to episode 3 of Season 5 of Game of Thrones, “High Sparrow”.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. BEACH
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A man hops out of his boat at night, and grabs a basket of fish. As he carries it on shore, Jorah knocks him out with a punch to the face. Looking around, he drags the man out of the water, and throws two coins on him. Jorah walks over to where he has Tyrion tied up. Tyrion is grunting, trying to cut the ropes binding him with a knife. Jorah picks up the knife and Tyrion. He throws Tyrion and his supplies into the boat, and then pushes it out to sea. Once it gains momentum, he hops in himself.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CUT TO: EXT. BOAT
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A number of men walk around doing various tasks on deck. Jaime Lannister looks out from the side of the boat. He turns to the captain.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Is that Estermont?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CAPTAIN: Tarth, Ser Jaime. (Shot of an island). The Sapphire Isle.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. BELOW DECK
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A knife hits a sandbag.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: You ever been to Dorne?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: No.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: (Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: (Incredulously) Your niece?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jaime and Bronn have a stare-off. After a moment, Jaime looks away. Bronn drinks some water.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: That's why you're here.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Because I don't want to start a war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: It has to be me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: (Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: It has to be me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: (Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: (Quietly) Varys set him free.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CUT TO: KING’S LANDING
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Cersei sits in her chair, looking angry. At the table is Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, Mace Tyrell, and an empty chair.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: How much can the Crown afford?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: With winter coming, half what they ask. Less.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Mace smiles, as if expecting a laugh. Qyburn and Pycelle both look down. Mace’s smile fades. Cersei smiles.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: Absolutely.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: In person.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: (After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: I will be honored, Your Grace.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Ser Meryn walks into the room. Mace turns to look at him, and then back at Cersei.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: My very own Kingsguard? Please express -
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MACE: (Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Mace laughs. Qyburn looks down, lightly chuckling. Mace exits, followed by Ser Meryn.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	PYCELLE: The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: (Walking out). Not small enough.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Pycelle watches her leave.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A note lies on the desk, stamped with the seal of the High Sparrow. The High Sparrow sits behind his desk, across from Cersei. She pours a glass of wine.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: No. (Smiles).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Cersei looks unsure, presumably having expected him to say yes. After a moment she smiles and pushes the wine away.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: Hmm.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: (After a moment). How may I serve?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: All sinners are equal before the Gods.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: (Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIGH SPARROW: May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. STREET
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A group of Faith Militant, wearing black robes and chains, walk down the street. Many nearby people chatter amongst themselves and look on. They begin breaking open casks of wine, and people begin screaming. One throws some men out of a building. Wine from the broken casks flows down some steps.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. A ROOM
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	We see a man in pain, sweating heavily and biting down on a piece of cloth. Someone begins carving something on his forehead, and his hand scratches and grabs at the table.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. MARKETPLACE
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Outside, the Faith Militant destroy a marketplace, smashing things for sale, flipping over tables, and attacking merchants. One merchant, laying on the ground, looks up at some gold cloaks on a castle wall.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MERCHANT: Help me! Help me!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The gold cloaks turn around, ignoring him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. A ROOM
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The man in the room continues to sweat and bite down on the cloth. His face trembles. The symbol continues being carved.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. BROTHEL
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A prostitute moans while having sex with a client. Some Faith Militant walk in and interrupt. She shrieks as one grabs her by the hair and pulls her off of the man. Another comes in grinning and strikes the man with a stick. The prostitute is forced out of the room. Some more men interrupt an orgy. Two women start screaming. They begin beating some of the participants, and taking others out of the room. Olyvar attempts to confront a member of the Faith Militant as the man drags out a prostitute.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	OLYVAR: (Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The man elbows Olyvar in the face and continues on his way. After most of the Faith’s Militant are gone, Olyvar hears a scream. He walks towards the source of the scream, blood running from his noise, and hears another scream.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MILITANT: Cocksucker! (Man screams). Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Olyvar stands just outside the doorway of a large room. Inside, a group of militants, most of them armed, stand around a male prostitute and his male client. Both are naked and bloody on the floor.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CLIENT: Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MILITANT: (Pulls out a knife). Yes, you will! Seize him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The client begins crying. Olyvar backs out of the doorway and begins running away. The client screams.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. A ROOM
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Someone finishes carving the symbol on the man’s head. The carver walks away and the man, revealed to be Lancel Lannister, sits up, breathing heavily. The symbol on his forehead is the symbol of the Faith Militant.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. STAIRWELL
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A number of Faith’s Militant, all armed, walk down a stairwell. They enter a clearing, where Loras Tyrell is sparring with another man. Some people are spectating. The militants, including Lancel, approach the fight. Loras, having knocked the other man to the ground, removes his helmet. He hands his sword to another man, who hands Loras a drink. He suddenly becomes aware of the presence of the militants.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MILITANT: Seize him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The militants grab Loras.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	LORAS: Get your hands off of me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	LANCEL: Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	LORAS: Who do you think you are?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	LANCEL: Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. HALLWAY
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Margaery walks down a hallway. She pushes a set of doors open, enters Tommen’s chambers, and angrily puts her hands on a table. Tommen is eating, and looks up at her, surprised.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: Why is my brother in a cell?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: (Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: Aren't you and mother getting along?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: (Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: (Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: I'll set him free for you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: Do you promise?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. CERSEI’S CHAMBERS
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Tommen walks into Cersei’s chambers. Cersei is staring out of a window and drinking wine.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: (Turns around). Did I arrest him?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CERSEI: I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. THE GREAT SEPT
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A group of kingsguard lead Tommen to the Great Sept.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	KINGSGUARD: Halt!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The party stops. Tommen gets out and goes to the steps of the Sept on foot, followed by guards. A number of people are seen milling about around the base of the steps. Some Faith Militant stand guarding the steps. They block Tommen and his guards from walking up.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MILITANT: His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	KINGSGUARD: Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	KINGSGUARD: You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The kingsguard and militants both adjust their stances, ready for a fight. A number of other people begin to watch. Some people begin yelling at Tommen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MAN 1: Bastard!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MAN 2: You're an abomination!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MAN 3: You're born of sin!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	WOMAN: Filthy bastard!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: We'll find another way.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Tommen begins walking away, followed by his guards.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MAN 4: Abomination!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Tommen opens the doors to his chambers, finding it empty.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: My Queen?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Margaery enters from outside.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: Are you? When?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: I--I don't know.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: You don't know?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: He was praying just now.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: (Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MARGAERY: I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TOMMEN: Of course.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CUT TO: THE WALL
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. CASTLE BLACK
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Some Night’s Watchmen spar in the courtyard. A number of others look on. Stannis and Selyse watch from some stairs.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SELYSE: You think highly of this boy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: (To some of the men sparring). Good.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SELYSE: A bastard by some tavern slut.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SELYSE: I should have given you a son.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: Not your fault.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SELYSE: Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: (Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SELYSE: My Lady.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Melisandre and Selyse stare at each other. After a moment, Selyse walks away.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: You march on Winterfell soon?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: We must. To beat the snows.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: I won't. I need you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: You only need faith, my King.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: (Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: To serve my Lord.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Stannis turns back. They both watch Jon sparring.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. JON’S CHAMBER
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jon sits at his desk. Sam hands him various letters to sign, one by one.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SAM: Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Caulfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: Never even heard of these people.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SAM: They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SAM: (Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Wibberley.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Sam’s face grows dark after reading the next letter. When Jon finishes signing the letter to Lord Wibberley, Sam hands it to him, saying nothing. Jon begins signing, but hesitates.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: Not him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SAM: I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: He murdered my brother.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SAM: We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jon hesitates another moment, and then relents and signs the letter. He leans his chair back, and Sam gathers up all of the signed letters. He walks away, almost bumping into Melisandre as she enters Jon’s chambers.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SAM: Apologies, my Lady.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Sam and Melisandre both look at Jon. Jon nods at Sam, and he leaves. Melisandre closes the door behind him, and Jon straightens up his posture.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: Lord Commander.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: How can I help you?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: No visions. No magic. Just life.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	She opens up her robes, naked underneath. She leans back, and takes Jon’s hand, slowly leading it up her body to cup her breast.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Melisandre smiles and looks down at Jon’s hand. Jon looks too. Realizing that she is no longer holding it there, he quickly pulls it away. Melisandre caresses Jon’s face and sits on his lap.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: I can't.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: Why?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jon keeps her from unbuttoning his coat any further, breathing heavily.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JON: I know. But I still love her.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Melisandre stands up, closes her robes, and walks away. After opening the door to leave, she turns to Jon.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MELISANDRE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jon’s mouth opens a bit. She smirks and leaves.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. STANNIS’S ROOM
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Stannis sits at his desk, reading something. There’s a knock at the door. After a moment, Shireen enters. Stannis looks up at her and then back down at his reading material. She closes the door. She smiles, but after Stannis doesn’t return her smile, she walks over to a nearby dresser and begins playing with the objects on top of it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: Are you lonely?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SHIREEN: (Turns around, holding something). Just bored.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SHIREEN: (Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SHIREEN: I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: Why do you say that?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SHIREEN: She told me, "I don't want to bring you."
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Shireen fiddles with the objects in her hands. Stannis looks down.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: She shouldn't have said that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Shireen puts down the objects she was playing with, and turns to leave. Before opening the door, she turns back to Stannis.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SHIREEN: Are you ashamed of me, father?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Stannis looks up surprised. He puts down what he was doing. Shireen looks down.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	STANNIS: When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	After a moment, Shireen hugs Stannis. At first hesitant, he hugs her back.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Sansa lights a candle on a tomb. She then walks over to Lyanna’s tomb and places a candle in the hand of Lyanna’s statue. She then leans down to pick a dusty feather off of the ground. As she blows off the dust, a figure is seen approaching in the background.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: Dressed for riding?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: I am.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: Where are you going?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: King's Landing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: King's Landing?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: You can't leave me here!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: How do you know?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: (They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: You don't know that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: And if you're right?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: I don't know how to do that.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: His father frightens me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BAELISH: He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	SANSA: I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Baelish chuckles and pats her shoulder. He turns and leaves as Sansa watches him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CUT TO: DORNE
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. BOAT
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	At night, Bronn and Jaime sit in a boat. Bronn rows to shore alone. Looking across at Jaime, Jaime holds up his fake hand. Bronn begrudgingly goes back to rowing alone. After they get to shore, they carry their boat in, and hide it in some tall grass. They then both walk away.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jaime awakens to find Bronn standing over him with a knife. His eyes widens and he moves to the side as Bronn brings his knife down on a snake that was about to bite Jaime. Jaime looks at the snake and Bronn pulls his knife out of it.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Breakfast.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Bronn and Jaime sit at a fire. Bronn cooks the snake while Jaime puts gloves on.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: That would have been a shit way to die.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Sounds like all the rest.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	While Bronn is distracted eating, Jaime gets rid of his food.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: What about you? What shit way would you choose?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: In the arms of the woman I love.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: She want the same thing?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Let's go.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	They both get up and gather their things. Bronn stomps out the fire. The scene cuts to them walking through some tall grass later.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Pentoshi.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: As I said. Why?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: A bag of gold.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: It was a heavy bag.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A horse neighs in the distance. Jaime looks around. A group of Dornish riders approach. Bronn and Jaime hide in the grass. Jaime watches the riders.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: How many you count?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Four.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: How many you think you can take?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: One, if he's slow.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Bronn turns to look at the riders.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	RIDER: Halt!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	The rider holds up his hand, and the party stops, having spotted Jaime and Bronn’s footsteps.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	RIDER: Who are you?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	RIDER: You're from King's Landing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	RIDER: Why are you here?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	RIDER: There are no sharks in Dorne.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: I could have sworn those were shark fins.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Dolphins maybe.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	RIDER: Throw your swords in the sand.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	RIDER: Swords in the sand! Now!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Bronn and Jaime look at each other. They pull out their swords. Bronn puts his down in the sand, and then flings a knife into the throat of a rider. He then kills another, stabbing him and knocking him off of his horse. A third charges him, and Bronn knocks him off of his horse as well. However, he survives. Bronn turns to Jaime.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: That one should be slow enough.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Bronn approaches the fourth and final rider. Jaime turns to the injured rider, who is revealed to be much larger than Jaime. They begin fighting. In the background, Bronn knocks the fourth rider off of his horse. As Jaime and the man fight, Jaime is slowly pushed back, down a hill. He falls over and begins rolling to escape his attacker. He loses his balance and his sword is knocked away. As the attacker brings his sword down to kill Jaime, Jaime brings his gold hand up to block it. The sword gets stuck in Jaime’s hand. As the attacker is stuck trying to remove the sword, Jaime picks his back up, kills him, and kicks him down the hill.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Luck.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: You had a wonderful teacher.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Bronn turns and walks away. Jaime looks back down the hill, and then to his hand. Failing to shake the sword off, he is forced to dislodge it by kicking it out of his own hand. Bronn is then seen cleaning his sword off on the clothes of one of the dead riders. He sheaths his sword as Jaime approaches.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: First we need to bury these bodies.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Birds have to eat too.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BRONN: Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JAIME: (Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jaime walks away as Bronn’s face drops. He begins dragging a body.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. BEACH
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Elaria, in all black, swiftly rides down a beach on horseback. She approaches a tent. Nearby are some more horses, and in the tent are Nymeria, Obara, and Tyene. Tyene exits the tent to meet her as she dismounts.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYENE: Nama!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Tyene and Elaria embrace.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	ELARIA: Nym, Obara.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	OBARA: Will it be war?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	ELARIA: Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	OBARA: Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	ELARIA: We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	NYMERIA: We may have a problem.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Nymeria uses a whip to knock a bucket away. Underneath is the captain who brought Jaime and Bronn to Dorne, buried neck-deep in sand and covered in scorpions.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	OBARA: A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	ELARIA: He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYENE: (Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	ELARIA: Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	OBARA: When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, "Girl or boy, we fight our battles. But the Gods let us choose our weapons." My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mother's tears.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Obara picks up a spear that was sticking out of the sand. She twirls it around for a moment, and then tosses it through the captain’s head, killing him.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	OBARA: (Smiles). I made my choice long ago.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Elaria and Tyene smile.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	CUT TO: EXT. BOAT AT SEA
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jorah steers the boat as Tyrion, tied up and gagged, tries to speak. He only succeeds in mumbling. Eventually he stops trying to say real words, and instead only tries to be as loud as possible, to annoy Jorah. Jorah comes over and ungags him, and then walks back over to continue steering.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYRION: Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JORAH: Your captor.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYRION: Do you have wine?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JORAH: No.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYRION: I can't sleep without wine.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JORAH: Then stay awake.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYRION: You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JORAH: I'm not taking you to your sister.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYRION: You said you were taking me to the Queen.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JORAH: I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYRION: (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	JORAH: What business would you have with the Queen?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	TYRION: Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Jorah stops steering and approaches Tyrion. Tyrion holds out his hands again, but Jorah strikes him, knocking him unconscious. He then goes back to steering, looking worried.

s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	Daenerys and Ser Barristan stand on the balcony.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: Why?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: He sang to them?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: And what did you do?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: He was good?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: He was very good. Viserys never told you?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: And what did you do with the money?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DARIO: (Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: How many others are there?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DARIO: Fifty a hundred.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DARIO: I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	BARRISTAN: Your Grace. (Leaves).
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	INT. AUDIENCE CHAMBER
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIZDAHR: All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	MISSANDEI: Glory?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIZDAHR: Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIZDAHR: Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	DAENERYS: I do not recognize this tradition.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	HIZDAHR: Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	EXT. MARKETPLACE
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	A prostitute and a soldier laugh with each other. Another soldier talks with some women. Some Sons of the Harpy kill all of the soldiers in the area, causing panic. In a nearby alley, some Unsullied march. Hearing the chaos, they begin running towards the market. They find the prostitute crying over the body of the dead soldier.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	WOMAN: (Speaking another language) Sons of the Harpy.
s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	She gestures in the direction the sons went. The Unsullied run in that direction. When they are out of view, she stops her act and wipes the tears away. The Unsullied enter a corridor, expecting to catch the sons. Instead, they themselves are ambushed from every direction by Sons of the Harpy. After a tense few moments, a fight breaks out. During the fight, one of the Unsullied’s helmet is knocked off, and is revealed to be Grey Worm. Another fight breaks out elsewhere. The two Unsullied there are killed almost immediately. Barristan walks down an alley and, upon noticing the chaos, heads to the fighting. Grey Worm is badly injured, and with his party killed, also badly outnumbered. Unsullied are shown being killed elsewhere. Grey Worm continues holding off the sons, and Barristan arrives to assist him. They are able to kill all of the sons, but are both seriously injured in the process. They fall unconscious, and the camera pans up to show them surrounded by all of the dead sons and Unsullied.

s05e04	Sons of the Harpy	An unofficial script to season 5 episode 4 of Game of Thrones, “Sons of the Harpy”.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. ROOM
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Grey Worm lays in a bed, asleep. Missandei stands over him, crying.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. THRONE ROOM
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The room is dark, except for some candles. Daenerys and Daario stand over the body of Barristan. Hizdahr enters with two men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	HIZDAHR: I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: "Barristan the Bold" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAARIO: We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Daario walks over the Daenerys and looks at Hizdahr. He looks back. Daenerys turns around.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	HIZDAHR: But... I'm the leader of my family.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Daario nods. The two men behind Hizdahr grab and restrain him. He is taken away.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	HIZDAHR: No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. DRAGON CHAMBER
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Daenerys, Daario, some Unsullied, and a number of men stand in the chamber. Daario holds a torch. After a few moments, Daenerys turns around and begins walking. Daario follows her. Then a chain can be heard rattling. Daenerys and Daario turn around.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Walk forward.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The Unsullied lower their spears at the other men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN: (Valyrian) You cannot do this.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The Unsullied begin walking forward, forcing the men to move. After a few moments, they stop. Chains rattle again.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: (Valyrian) Another step.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The Unsullied and the men take another step. Chains rattle and an unseen dragon snarls. Daenerys walks through the Unsullied to the front of the group.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: (Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Daenerys looks at Daario. He walks over and pushes the mumbling man forward, onto his knees.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The man’s eyes widen. A dragon comes out of the shadows and breathes fire on him. He screams and dies. The dragons take his corpse, tear it in two, and eat it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: (Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	HIZDAHR: (Valyrian) All men must die.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The other men besides Hizdahr grovel before Daenerys. The dragons continue eating. After a moment, she takes her hand off of Hizdahr.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Daario and the Unsullied take the men out. Daenerys watches her dragons eat for a moment, and then walks out herself.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. LIBRARY
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Sam sits at a table, reading a letter. Aemon is with him.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: "And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure." She sounds like quite a woman.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	AEMON: And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: Don't say that, Maester Aemon.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	AEMON: A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jon walks in.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Maester Aemon.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	AEMON: Lord Commander.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Sam gets up, grabs his papers, and leaves. Jon walks over and sits at the table.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: How are you feeling?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	AEMON: Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	AEMON: Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: But you don't know what it is.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	AEMON: That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. ROOM
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jon and Tormund sit across from each other at a table.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: What about you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: Hard to lead when you're in chains.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: What if I unchained you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: Why would you do that?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: And now everything is going to change?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: It is.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: Why now?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: (Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: (Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jon unchains Tormund. Tormund’s eyes widen as he feels his hands.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: We'll need ships.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TORMUND: All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. DINING HALL
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The Night’s Watchmen present talk amongst themselves. Stannis and Davos are present. Jon stands at a table in the front of the room with Allister and two others. One of them addresses Jon.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN 1: You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN 1: Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Some of the men in the crowd cheer.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: Fewer.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: What?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: Nothing.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: (Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN 2: And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The man points to Olly, who lowers his head. Sam sits down.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ALLISTER: We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: And we've slaughtered theirs.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	EDD: I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The men in the room return to bickering loudly.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jon walks in, takes off his coat, and puts his hands on his desk. Olly knocks and walks in with a plate of food, and sets it down.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	OLLY: You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: It's not a trick.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	OLLY: They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	OLLY: Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: No.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Olly leaves. Jon sighs.

s05e05	Kill the Boy	Podrick walks carrying some supplies. He enters a building. Inside, Brienne stares out of a window. Podrick sets down the supplies.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	PODRICK: She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: (Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	A man enters with some water and a towel.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN: Aye.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: Did you know Lord Eddard?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN: I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN: Everyone knows. The Boltons.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN: Who are you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: Someone who swore to keep her safe.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN: Swore to who?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: Her mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MAN: Her mother's dead.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	BRIENNE: That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Myranda stands naked in front of a window.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Come back here. Myranda.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: I saw you staring at her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: You said you'd marry me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: Do you think she's pretty?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Of course I do. I'm not blind.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay sighs and gets up. He walks over to Myranda and grabs her waist.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: Perhaps I'll marry, too.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: (Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	After a moment, Myranda kisses him. She then bites down hard on his lower lip, causing it to bleed.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: (Smiles). Never.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay smiles back. They begin having sex.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. SANSA’S CHAMBERS
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Sansa sits alone at a table. There’s a knock on the door. She turns, gets up, and opens it. An old servant woman comes in.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	WOMAN: Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: Oh, I don't need-
s05e05	Kill the Boy	WOMAN: (Closes the door). You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: But who -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	WOMAN: You're not alone.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The woman leaves, and closes the door.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	EXT. OUTSIDE
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Sansa walks through the snow, looking up at the broken tower. Myranda approaches her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: I like your dress. Who made it for you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: I made it myself.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: Really?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: Who, who are you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? (Takes Sansa’s arm and inspects her sleeve). Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: My mother. (Pulls away).
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: I'm sorry for what happened to her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: Thank you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: I'd rather have a mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. DUNGEON ENTRANCE
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Myranda opens the gate and lets Sansa in. Some dogs bark.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: Down there at the end.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: What is it?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MYRANDA: That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The dogs continue barking and growling. Sansa walks down the aisle of cages. Most contain dogs. Sansa looks behind to see Myranda has disappeared. She comes to the last cage, which is open. Inside is Theon, on the floor. He gets up and notices her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: Theon?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: You shouldn't be here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	She looks at him angrily. He backs away from her. She leaves.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon unties Ramsay’s jacket.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon walks over to a table and pours some wine. He then brings it over to Ramsay, who drinks it.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Do you have something to tell me?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: No, my lord.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Reek.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: (Stuttering). She saw me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Who?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: She saw you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Come here.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon walks forward. Ramsay holds his chin.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon gets on his knees. Ramsay sips his wine, and then puts it aside. Theon looks down.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Give me your hand.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon hesitantly holds his hand up. As Ramsay takes it, Theon begins stammering. After a moment, Ramsay cups Theon’s hand with his own hands.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: I forgive you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon looks up. Ramsay smiles.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. DINING HALL
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Sansa, Ramsay, Roose, and Walda sit at a table, eating.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: Yes, thank you, my lord.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Allow me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay pours Sansa some wine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	WALDA: Thank you, Ramsay.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	He pours her some wine as well. She smiles. Ramsay gets up and holds his wine up.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: (Raises his cup). To your wedding.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	WALDA: (Raises her cup). To your wedding.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay takes a large sip of wine. Sansa puts her own glass down. Ramsay sits down.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	WALDA: It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: You're right. Very strange. More wine, please.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon enters the room with some wine. Sansa looks away.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: (Turns around). Yes, master.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: That's his new name, Reek.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: Why are you doing this?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Theon shakes his head "no" when Ramsay looks away
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: (After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: I'm sorry.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Sorry about what?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	THEON: For killing your brothers.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: Yes, yes, very good.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Wonderful. (Sips wine).
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	WALDA: We're going to have a baby.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SANSA: I'm very happy for you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay sips some wine and angrily sets his cup down. Sansa looks at him smugly.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. ROOSE’S WAR ROOM
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay and Roose sit at a war table.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: How can you be sure?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: Sure of what?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay gets up and walks around to the other side of the table, wine in hand.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: So how did you manage it?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: Manage what?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Getting her pregnant.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Of course, but how did you find it?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: And if it's a boy?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: You're worried about your position.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Ramsay finished his wine and goes to get more.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: You've never asked me about your mother.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	ROOSE: She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	RAMSAY: Yes.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. LIBRARY
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Gilly walks through the bookshelves, examining them. Sam sits at the table reading.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: Is this every book there is?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: Every book there is?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: In the world.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: Where you grew up, were there more books?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: Where's that?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: The Citadel? In Oldtown.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: I'm sorry I don't know things.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: Well -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: It's where they train the maesters.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GILLY: Like Maester Aemon?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Stannis enters the library. Sam stands up.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: Ah, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Gilly quickly exits.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: You're Samwell Tarly?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: I am, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: I did, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: How?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: With a dagger made of dragonglass.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: Dragonglass?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: What the maesters call obsidian -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: I've seen it, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: Seen what?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SAM: The army of the dead. And when they come -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: We have to know how to fight them. (After a moment). Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Stannis leaves.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. DINING HALL
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Davos carves away at a piece of wood. Stannis approaches him.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: It's time.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: No need, they're coming with us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	They walk outside.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: As you wish, Your Grace.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Stannis walks away. Davos spots Melisandre.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	EXT. COURTYARD - THE NEXT MORNING
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Stannis’s men prepare to ride out. Sam and Gilly watch. Gilly holds baby Sam. Olly, Edd, and some other watchmen are also shown watching.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SHIREEN: (On horseback). Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: Beg your pardon?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SHIREEN: At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SHIREEN: Is there going to be a battle?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SELYSE: That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: Yes, my queen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SHIREEN: I'm not scared.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAVOS: Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	SHIREEN: (Smiling). I promise.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Shireen looks back at Gilly. Selyse catches her, and she looks down and away. Jon walks through the courtyard. He and Stannis meet on some stairs.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	STANNIS: I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JON: You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jon watches Stannis walk away and get on his horse. He makes eye contact with Melisandre, but she looks away. Stannis and his army begin leaving.

s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. GREY WORM’S ROOM
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Missandei watches over Grey Worm. He suddenly gets up, startling her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MISSANDEI:  You're still too weak. (He lays back down).
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GREY WORM: (Valyrian) How long have I been here?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MISSANDEI: (Valyrian) Three days.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	He looks at her. His face is bruised.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GREY WORM: Ser Barristan?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Missandei shakes her head.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GREY WORM: (Valyrian) I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MISSANDEI: (Valyrian) You failed no one. You fought bravely. You’ll fight again. (In Common Tongue) Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GREY WORM: This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MISSANDEI: All men fear death.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	GREY WORM: No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Missandei looks down, on the verge of tears. She gets up and lies down in the bed with him, caressing his face, and then kissing him.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. DAENERYS’S CHAMBERS
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Missandei and Daenerys stand, talking.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MISSANDEI: Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MISSANDEI: Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: (Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	MISSANDEI: I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	INT. DUNGEONS
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Daenerys is led by Unsullied to a room in a dungeon. The door is opened to reveal Hizdahr. She enters, and he kneels before her.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	HIZDAHR: My, my queen, please do not do this.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: What about "Valar Morghulis"?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	HIZDAHR: I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. (Sniffles).
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	HIZDAHR: Yes, my queen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	DAENERYS: And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Hizdahr looks surprised. Daenerys faintly smiles, and then leaves. Hizdahr is left in the cell, with the door wide open.

s05e05	Kill the Boy	EXT. JORAH’S BOAT
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Tyrion wakes up and feels his head.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: We are.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: No wine.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jorah stands up and looks ahead. Tyrion turns as well. A large bank of fog lies ahead of the boat.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: I am.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: Have you sailed this route before?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: No.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: I think you'll be plenty.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: No. But the pirates are.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: Oh.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	EXT. RIVER SURROUNDED BY WOODS
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: And then they weren't.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: And then they weren't. "They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: "The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: I would clap.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	He holds up his bound hands. Jorah smirks.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	They look at the approaching ruins of the city. Suddenly Tyrion spots Drogon passing overhead. He stands up. Both of them look up and watch as he passes. Behind Tyrion, someone hops in the water. Jorah hears the splash and turns to see the ripples.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: What was that?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	The boat passes into a tunnel. A Stone Man jumps down into the boat from the ceiling.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jorah hits the stone man from behind before he gets to Tyrion. They begin fighting. Another stone man jumps into the water and begins trying to get on the boat. Tyrion tries to keep him off. Jorah manages to push the first man into the water. He then begins fighting the other one.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: Get behind!
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jorah climbs back onto the boat and fights off the stone man. He manages to get his sword and cuts the stone man. The other stone man inches his way towards Tyrion.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: Mormont! Mormont!
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jorah cuts through the stone man he was fighting and pushes him into the water. Tyrion rolls into the water to avoid the other one. He desperately tries to remove the rope around his hands. A stone man grabs his ankle and begins attempting to pull him down. The screen fades to black. After a few moments, we see Tyrion’s perspective. Jorah stands over him as his eyes slowly blink open.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	EXT. SHORE
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: (Faintly). Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Tyrion looks around. Jorah helps him up. He unsheathes his knife and cuts Tyrion’s binds.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: I suppose that's why they send them there.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: Without luck?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	JORAH: We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?
s05e05	Kill the Boy	TYRION: That's the best idea you've had all day.
s05e05	Kill the Boy	Jorah walks away. After looking out for a moment, he stops, and pulls up his sleeve. He examines his wrist, which has the beginnings of greyscale. After a moment, he begins walking again.

s05e07	The Gift	JON: First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.
s05e07	The Gift	ALLISER: Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings.

s05e07	The Gift	JON: As always, thank you for your honesty.
s05e07	The Gift	Jon walks away to Sam.

s05e07	The Gift	SAM: His little brother, Aegon. He became king.
s05e07	The Gift	AEMON: And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one.

s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: Help me.
s05e07	The Gift	THEON: You’re his wife now.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: Theon
s05e07	The Gift	THEON: Do what he says. Do what he says or he’ll hurt you.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: He already hurts me every night. All day I’m locked in this room and every night he comes. It can’t be worse.
s05e07	The Gift	THEON: It can. It can always be worse.
s05e07	The Gift	Sansa stands up.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: What did he do to you?
s05e07	The Gift	THEON: Please…
s05e07	The Gift	Theon goes for the door. Sansa runs to the door and blocks him from leaving.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: You betrayed my family!
s05e07	The Gift	THEON: I’m sorry. I’m sorry!
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: You have to help me!
s05e07	The Gift	THEON: He’ll see us. You don’t know him.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they’ll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon.
s05e07	The Gift	THEON: Reek, my lady, Reek!
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me.

s05e07	The Gift	EXT. CASTLE BLACK
s05e07	The Gift	Close up on Maester Aemon’s funeral pyre.
s05e07	The Gift	SAM: His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King’s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.
s05e07	The Gift	BROTHERS: And now his watch has ended.
s05e07	The Gift	Sam lights the pyre, then hands the torch to Alliser, who lights it then passes it along.

s05e07	The Gift	They start walking down stairs. Sansa grabs a cross in the snow before they leave.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He’s a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He’s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army’s out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I’ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You’ll be my Lady and Wardeness.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: But isn’t your step mother pregnant?
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: What of it?

s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: Then I’ll have a baby brother.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: But he’ll be the heir.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: I’m Lord Bolton’s eldest son.
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: But you’re a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim.
s05e07	The Gift	Ramsay stops walking.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: I’ve been naturalized by a royal decree of--
s05e07	The Gift	SANSA: Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.
s05e07	The Gift	They start walking again.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.
s05e07	The Gift	Sansa looks shocked.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: You didn’t know? Yes, he’s done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady.

s05e07	The Gift	The woman who visited Sansa’s chamber previously is out in the open, flayed to death.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.
s05e07	The Gift	Cut to Theon looking terrified.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.
s05e07	The Gift	Sansa continues to look at the woman, horrified.
s05e07	The Gift	RAMSAY: Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It’s far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.
s05e07	The Gift	He kisses her on the cheek then she is carried away.

s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold.
s05e07	The Gift	DAVOS: We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: And?
s05e07	The Gift	DAVOS: This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: I retreated from King’s Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”
s05e07	The Gift	DAVOS: Your Grace..
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it’s a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last.
s05e07	The Gift	DAVOS: It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we’ve lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,
s05e07	The Gift	Davos looks to Melisandre, lurking in the back of the tent.
s05e07	The Gift	DAVOS: Your Grace. (leaves)
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS (to Melisandre): I’ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years.
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: I don’t know what I saw.
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: You do know. Trust yourself.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: And you, do you trust yourself?
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: I trust in the Lord.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: Are you sure?
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
s05e07	The Gift	She flips the Bolton pieces over on Stannis’ board.
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: We don’t have Robert’s bastard here.
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: Have you lost your mind?
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: Do you doubt me still? After all that you’ve seen?
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: There must be another way. Leeches or something.
s05e07	The Gift	MELISANDRE: There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.
s05e07	The Gift	STANNIS: She’s my daughter.
s05e07	The Gift	Melisandre embraces him.

s05e07	The Gift	BRAND: Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?
s05e07	The Gift	DERRYK: The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she’s the only girl here?
s05e07	The Gift	BRAND: Even in White Harbor, I’d want a kiss.
s05e07	The Gift	DERRYK: Come on love, give us a kiss.

s05e07	The Gift	BRAND: Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?
s05e07	The Gift	DERRYK: Look at his hands shaking.

s05e07	The Gift	Derryk throws her to the floor.
s05e07	The Gift	SAM: I’m warning you.
s05e07	The Gift	DERRYK: Come on! Come on!
s05e07	The Gift	Sam swings the sword. It is deflected and he is subdued. Derryk punches him in the gut then starts kicking him.
s05e07	The Gift	DERRYK: You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. (to Gilly) He’s your hero. He’s a hog!
s05e07	The Gift	GILLY: Leave him alone!
s05e07	The Gift	She charges at Derryk. He subdues her.

s05e07	The Gift	Brand kicks Sam in the face.
s05e07	The Gift	GILLY: Sam! Sam! Sam!
s05e07	The Gift	He punches Sam repeatedly in the face until he seems to lose consciousness.
s05e07	The Gift	BRAND: Alright. Hold still.
s05e07	The Gift	They both hold Gilly down as she screams. Sam gets back up.
s05e07	The Gift	SAM: I said get your hands off her.

s05e07	The Gift	GILLY: I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn’t come.
s05e07	The Gift	SAM: No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
s05e07	The Gift	GILLY: Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter.
s05e07	The Gift	SAM: What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
s05e07	The Gift	GILLY: Just promise me that whatever happens you’ll take care of little Sam.

This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat.

s05e07	The Gift	BUYER: Yes.
s05e07	The Gift	TYRION: My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…

s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: Are you jealous?
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: I do.
s05e07	The Gift	Daario laughs.
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure.
s05e07	The Gift	They start kissing.
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: Doesn’t make me wrong.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice.

s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: No. I can’t
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free.
s05e07	The Gift	Daenerys sits up in bed.
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: Of course
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.
s05e07	The Gift	DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.
s05e07	The Gift	INT. KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got.
s05e07	The Gift	HIGH SPARROW: It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: Don’t spar with me little fellow.
s05e07	The Gift	The High Septon gets up.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: For me, it’s the knees. You?
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: Hips.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Huh.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: The people always do the dirty work.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: A useful talent.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished.
s05e07	The Gift	The High Sparrow heads for the door.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: Don’t you walk away from me.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
s05e07	The Gift	The High Sparrow laughs.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: What then?
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I’m telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA (with contempt): I’ve read the seven pointed star.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…
s05e07	The Gift	He walks out of the room.

s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.
s05e07	The Gift	TOMMEN: She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do!
s05e07	The Gift	Tommen walks to the window. Cersei joins him.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.
s05e07	The Gift	Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had. You cannot blame yourself for fate. Your father, your brother, your grandfather-- I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world. Kissed their heads after they'd gone.
s05e07	The Gift	TOMMEN: I’ll call in the army. I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I’ll start a war if I have to.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
s05e07	The Gift	TOMMEN: I love her. I love her. I can’t help her.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
s05e07	The Gift	TOMMEN: I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Your happiness is all I want in this world
s05e07	The Gift	TOMMEN: I know.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.
s05e07	The Gift	Cersei embraces him and starts crying.
s05e07	The Gift	INT. DORNE
s05e07	The Gift	Jaime is being kept in a closely monitored room.

s05e07	The Gift	Areo brings Myrcella into the room.
s05e07	The Gift	MYRCELLA: You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
s05e07	The Gift	JAIME: And more hands. How’s Trystane?
s05e07	The Gift	MYRCELLA: He’ll be alright.
s05e07	The Gift	JAIME: I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.
s05e07	The Gift	MYRCELLA: Why is it happening at all?
s05e07	The Gift	JAIME: Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.
s05e07	The Gift	MYRCELLA: This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn’t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?
s05e07	The Gift	JAIME: It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
s05e07	The Gift	MYRCELLA: It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here.
s05e07	The Gift	JAIME: I don’t understand.
s05e07	The Gift	MYRCELLA: Of course you don’t! You don’t know me!
s05e07	The Gift	Myrcella leaves the room.
s05e07	The Gift	INT. DORNE - CELL
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN (singing): Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife!
s05e07	The Gift	In the adjacent cell to Bronn, Tyene claps as the other Snakes glare at her.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: He’s got a good voice.
s05e07	The Gift	OBARA: We’re lucky he’s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: It’s against my code to hurt a woman.
s05e07	The Gift	OBARA: It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: I wouldn’t say you beat me.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: How’s your arm?
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: You think you’re leaving Dorne?
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: Thank you.
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: Name one more beautiful than I am.
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...
s05e07	The Gift	Tyene takes one of her breasts out of her tunic.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying.
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: Was I?
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
s05e07	The Gift	Tyene takes both her breasts out.
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: How’s your arm now?
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
s05e07	The Gift	Tyene undoes the rest of her tunic.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: And how about your head?
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in…
s05e07	The Gift	As Bronn scans her naked body, his vision starts to blur and he collapses to the ground.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: Your nose is bleeding.
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN: It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.
s05e07	The Gift	She holds a tiny blue cap up to Bronn from her cell.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: The only antidote. Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?
s05e07	The Gift	Bronn gasps for breath.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: Sorry? Who?
s05e07	The Gift	BRONN (finally): You.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: Don’t drop it.
s05e07	The Gift	Tyene tosses it into his cell and Bronn downs it.
s05e07	The Gift	TYENE: I think you’re very handsome as well.
s05e07	The Gift	INT. KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL
s05e07	The Gift	Littlefinger peers at the Great Sept of Baelor through the window. The brothel is destroyed, with many seven-pointed stars scribbled on the floor, walls, and artwork.
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: I’m sorry about the locale.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: No you’re not.
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: It felt like the safest place.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: Not for your clientele, clearly.
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong.
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: I promise you..
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: And what did she want?
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.
s05e07	The Gift	OLENNA: What kind of gift?
s05e07	The Gift	BAELISH: The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.

s05e07	The Gift	Gladiators prepare their swords and armor.
s05e07	The Gift	SLAVE OWNER: Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something.

s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
s05e07	The Gift	HIZDAHR: For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.
s05e07	The Gift	The fighters enter the pit.
s05e07	The Gift	OWNER: Move yourselves!
s05e07	The Gift	The slave owner sees Daenerys and runs in front of her and Hizdahr.
s05e07	The Gift	OWNER: Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
s05e07	The Gift	The owner gets all his gladiators to face Dany, whispering instructions to them.
s05e07	The Gift	OWNER: “We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”
s05e07	The Gift	MEN: “We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”
s05e07	The Gift	The fight begins
s05e07	The Gift	INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA
s05e07	The Gift	Jorah hears “O glorious queen” and runs to the edge of the pit. He sees Daenerys through the grated entrance to the ring.
s05e07	The Gift	EXT. FIGHTING PIT
s05e07	The Gift	One bald gladiator dominates the pit. He slits one fighter’s throat, and slices another fighter’s leg as he runs away.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: I think I’ve seen enough.
s05e07	The Gift	HIZDAHR: Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
s05e07	The Gift	INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA
s05e07	The Gift	Jorah straps a helmet on.
s05e07	The Gift	TYRION: What are you doing?
s05e07	The Gift	EXT. FIGHTING PIT
s05e07	The Gift	Jorah rushes the pit. His owner tries to stop him but he knocks him out with the butt of his sword. Jorah takes out the bald man as he was smashing a man’s head in with a rock. Daenerys takes notice of the fighter but can’t see his face.
s05e07	The Gift	INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA
s05e07	The Gift	The other gladiators that weren’t chosen to fight follow Jorah’s lead and enter the ring. Tyrion tries but is chained up. He starts sawing at his chain.

s05e07	The Gift	INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA

s05e07	The Gift	EXT. FIGHTING PIT
s05e07	The Gift	Daenerys is watching intently now. Jorah is the last man standing. He walks up to Daenerys and Hizdahr and removes his helmet. She stares at him for a moment.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: Get him out of my sight.
s05e07	The Gift	Her men grab Jorah.
s05e07	The Gift	JORAH: Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift.
s05e07	The Gift	TYRION (O.S.): It’s true. He has.
s05e07	The Gift	Tyrion enters the pit.
s05e07	The Gift	DAENERYS: Who are you?
s05e07	The Gift	TYRION: I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.

s05e07	The Gift	INT. KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL
s05e07	The Gift	Cersei enters Margaery’s cell.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.
s05e07	The Gift	MARGAERY: I know you did this.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
s05e07	The Gift	MARGAERY: Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.
s05e07	The Gift	MARGAERY: I don’t want to see you again.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.
s05e07	The Gift	MARGAERY: Leave.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.
s05e07	The Gift	Margaery throws the medicine at Cersei.
s05e07	The Gift	MARGAERY: Get out you hateful bitch!
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Sleep well, sister.
s05e07	The Gift	Cersei walks out smiling. She is taken to High Septon’s room by a Sparrow.
s05e07	The Gift	INT. GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL
s05e07	The Gift	HIGH SPARROW (to Sparrow): Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Yes.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: And?
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Who will stand judge?
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Will you be one of them?
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: I will.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: I think I may have heard at one point.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
s05e07	The Gift	The High Septon gestures to a stone altar with seven-pointed stars engraved into it.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: Who carved this altar do you know?
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: I’m afraid i don’t.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
s05e07	The Gift	Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains. Something simple, solid, and true. The Tyrell’s finery will be stripped away. Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see. And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike. What will we find when we strip away your finery?
s05e07	The Gift	The High Septon stares intently at Cersei.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird.
s05e07	The Gift	Cersei gives a faint laugh.
s05e07	The Gift	SPARROW: And he has much to say about you.
s05e07	The Gift	Lancell enters the room and stands next to the High Septon. Cersei goes for the door and is blocked.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Move. Let me go immediately.
s05e07	The Gift	Cersei is grabbed and carried away from the room.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI (O.S.): You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
s05e07	The Gift	INT. BLACK CELL
s05e07	The Gift	Cersei is thrown into the cell. She looks up at the people who put her there.
s05e07	The Gift	CERSEI: Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die.
s05e07	The Gift	The door slams closed and is bolted shut.

s05e08	Hardhome	INT. MEEREEN - PYRAMID
s05e08	Hardhome	JORAH: Your Grace, I want to say--
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: If only I were otherwise.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: I have a very large army and very large dragons.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: I know.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.
s05e08	Hardhome	Tyrion approaches Daenerys and Missandei. Her guards raise their spears to her. Daenerys waves them off.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Yes, many opportunities.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: And did he?
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: No. Not until forced to do so.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: So I should kill him?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
s05e08	Hardhome	Daenerys and Jorah hold back tears. Jorah is escorted out of the Pyramid. Jorah checks his Greyscale and walks away.

s05e08	Hardhome	She slaps Cersei with a spoon.
s05e08	Hardhome	SEPTA: Confess. I meant it.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: My face will be the last thing you see before--
s05e08	Hardhome	She slaps her with a spoon again then leaves. Cersei starts screaming.

s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.
s05e08	Hardhome	CUT TO: EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET
s05e08	Hardhome	Arya pushes an oyster cart through a crowded market.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA (V.O.): Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--
s05e08	Hardhome	CUT TO: INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s05e08	Hardhome	Jaqen slaps her.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: How will she serve him?
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: What will she do there?
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: She will see.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: See what?
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: Oysters, clams and cockles!
s05e08	Hardhome	Arya takes a right with the cart.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
s05e08	Hardhome	THIN MAN: Your oysters fresh?
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: Best in the city.
s05e08	Hardhome	THIN MAN: You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?
s05e08	Hardhome	Arya cracks an oyster and hands him one he slurps it.
s05e08	Hardhome	THIN MAN: Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
s05e08	Hardhome	A man throws a bag of money and a map on the Thin Man’s table.
s05e08	Hardhome	MAN: It’s my 18th voyage. I’ve returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
s05e08	Hardhome	THIN MAN: Can’t do it.
s05e08	Hardhome	MAN: Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don’t understand?
s05e08	Hardhome	He is carried away as the Thin Man slurps the oyster
s05e08	Hardhome	CUT TO: INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: A girl tells a man that she has seen.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?
s05e08	Hardhome	Arya looks to see a man praying on the floor.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
s05e08	Hardhome	ARYA: And then what?
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: A gift for the Thin Man.
s05e08	Hardhome	He holds up a clear vile. Arya takes the vile, smiling.
s05e08	Hardhome	WAIF: She is not ready.
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not.
s05e08	Hardhome	WAIF: And if she’s not?
s05e08	Hardhome	JAQEN: It is all the same to the Many Faced God.

s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: The charges?
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: All lies.
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: Tell him I need to speak to him.
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: I implored him to visit you but he would not.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: I can’t stay here.
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: There is a way, Your Grace. A way out.
s05e08	Hardhome	CERSEI: Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.
s05e08	Hardhome	The septa enters the room.
s05e08	Hardhome	QYBURN: Goodbye my queen. The work continues.

s05e08	Hardhome	Theon enters Sansa’s room and sets food down.
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Why. Why Theon.
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Good. If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: They weren’t “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born.
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: They weren’t. They were only--
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Only what?
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: I can’t..
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Tell me!
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: I can’t, not unless the master says...
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Tell me, they weren’t what?!
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: They weren’t...
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren’t your brothers!
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: You didn’t…?
s05e08	Hardhome	Theon shakes his head no.
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: I can’t talk to you anymore.
s05e08	Hardhome	SANSA: Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--
s05e08	Hardhome	THEON: Not Theon, Reek!

s05e08	Hardhome	BOLTON BANNERMAN: Our scouts tells us he’s got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however.
s05e08	Hardhome	ROOSE: And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.
s05e08	Hardhome	Ramsay gives a disagreeing look.
s05e08	Hardhome	ROOSE: You disagree?
s05e08	Hardhome	RAMSAY: Stannis isn’t from the North. You are, father. I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.
s05e08	Hardhome	ROOSE: And what do you recommend?
s05e08	Hardhome	RAMSAY: That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows.
s05e08	Hardhome	ROOSE: A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to.
s05e08	Hardhome	RAMSAY: I don’t need an army. I need 20 good men.

s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: It’s probably my safest option.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: And what would your father do?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Is that why you killed him?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: I’m terrible?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: I’ve heard stories.
s05e08	Hardhome	DANERYS: Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Which kind is that?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION:  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Perhaps it won’t come to that.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: But you trust him?
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: The brother who killed my father.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: That’s the one.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: I’m not going to kill you.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: No? Banish me?
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: No.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished...
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Advise you on what?
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: How to get what I want.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: And when you get back to your home, who supports you?
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: The common people.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAENERYS: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.
s05e08	Hardhome	TYRION: It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.

s05e08	Hardhome	MASTER: You struck me.
s05e08	Hardhome	JORAH: I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I’m the best you’ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?

s05e08	Hardhome	SAM: Yes?
s05e08	Hardhome	OLLY: He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
s05e08	Hardhome	SAM: We’ve been fighting them for years.
s05e08	Hardhome	OLLY: This wasn’t a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why’s he saving them?
s05e08	Hardhome	SAM: Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.
s05e08	Hardhome	OLLY: The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.
s05e08	Hardhome	SAM: Olly...
s05e08	Hardhome	OLLY: How can he trust him?
s05e08	Hardhome	SAM: I’ve seen the army of the dead. I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living. And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find.
s05e08	Hardhome	OLLY: But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
s05e08	Hardhome	SAM: Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to. We don’t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.
s05e08	Hardhome	OLLY: You believe that?
s05e08	Hardhome	SAM: With all my heart.
s05e08	Hardhome	Olly looks conflicted. He walks towards the door.

s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: There are old stories about Dragonglass.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: Come with you where?
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
s05e08	Hardhome	There is hesitation.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: If…?
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: Where is Mance?
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: He died.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: How?
s05e08	Hardhome	JON (after a long pause): I put an arrow through his heart.
s05e08	Hardhome	The wildlings in the cabin start to riot.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
s05e08	Hardhome	Loboda brandishes his axe. Tormund steps forward.
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today: the courage to make peace with men we’ve been fighting for generations.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight.
s05e08	Hardhome	There are small nods of approval throughout the room.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: You vouch for this man, Tormund?
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead.
s05e08	Hardhome	Karsi walks in front of Jon.
s05e08	Hardhome	I’ll never trust a man in black.
s05e08	Hardhome	Karsi walks over to Tormund.
s05e08	Hardhome	But I trust you, Tormund. If you say this is the way, we’re with you.
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: This is the way.
s05e08	Hardhome	WILDLING ELDER: I’m with Tormund. We stay here we’re dead men. At least with King Crow there’s a chance.
s05e08	Hardhome	GIANT: Tormund.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That’s our enemy. That has always been our enemy.
s05e08	Hardhome	Wildlings start leaving the cabin and head towards the boats.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI (to Tormund): I fucking hate Thenns.
s05e08	Hardhome	Tormund nods.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon, Tormund, and Karsi lead the Wildlings to the boats.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: How many are with us? 5000?
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: I’m not good at counting.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: We’re leaving too many behind.
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: And he knew them better than I ever will.
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around.
s05e08	Hardhome	Cut to Karsi loading two children onto a boat.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: Johnna is gonna look after you. She’s in charge, you listen to her.
s05e08	Hardhome	DAUGHTER: I wanna go with you.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: I need to get the old folks on the boats. I’m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on.
s05e08	Hardhome	INT. HARDHOME - CABIN
s05e08	Hardhome	The Giant picks up a piece of Dragonglass and strokes it intently. Edd begins picking up the pieces of glass and looks at the giant with his piece of glass. Wun Wun turns to Edd and stares at him annoyed.
s05e08	Hardhome	WUN WUN: Lokh kif rukh?
s05e08	Hardhome	Edd leaves. Dogs are barking outside.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon loads girls onto a boat then turns to hear the dogs barking. The wind starts whipping from a neighboring cliff and the dogs start whimpering. Every wildling and Crow slowly turns to the source of the noise.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - GATE
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: Shut the gate.
s05e08	Hardhome	Men hurry towards the gate to board it up. More howling from the distance. The Wildlings on the other side of the gate begin charging the gate.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: Shut the gate!!
s05e08	Hardhome	Men rush to put a board in place to hold the gate shut.
s05e08	Hardhome	SHOUTING: Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!
s05e08	Hardhome	Loboda walks to the gate with his axe and peers through a small hole in the wall. There is a faint scream in the distance, then a wight charges at the hole in the wall.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: Ready your arrows!
s05e08	Hardhome	The wights claw at the gate. Arrows are nocked and fired. A wight sticks his hand through the gate and Loboda chops it off.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE
s05e08	Hardhome	There is a mad rush towards the boats with many people jumping in the water to catch one.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Get in line! Get in line!
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - GATE
s05e08	Hardhome	A wight tries to climb the gate.
s05e08	Hardhome	INT. HARDHOME - CABIN
s05e08	Hardhome	Wights crawl to the top of the cabin and jumps through the hole in the roof. The men prepare their weapons and the giant growls.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - GATE
s05e08	Hardhome	One wight tries to climb under the gate. A barrage of arrows flies at the wights trying to get through the wall. Most of them land. The wight crawls even further under the gate. The wights start making holes in the gate. A sword sticks through the gate coming close to Loboda on the gate. Loboda dodges the sword, looks down to see the wight crawling under the gate, and stomps its head in.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE
s05e08	Hardhome	The people continue to rush onto the boats with Jon, Tormund, and Karsi leading them.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Hold the line! Hold the line!
s05e08	Hardhome	NIGHT’S WATCH BROTHER: Lord Commander!
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Get them to the ship and come back for me!
s05e08	Hardhome	BROTHER: But you’ll never make it--
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Now!
s05e08	Hardhome	Karsi approaches Jon.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: You should be on one of those boats.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: You have my word. I’ve given orders.
s05e08	Hardhome	KARSI: Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders !
s05e08	Hardhome	Karsi heads back to helping people onto the boats.
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: If they get through, everyone dies !
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon, Tormund, Karsi, and the Night’s Watch brothers charge from the shore to the gate.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE
s05e08	Hardhome	The wights have knocked a hole into the gate big enough to crawl out of. One breaks through, tears someone apart, and then is taken down. A group of wights storm through the same hole. Cut to an overhead that shows just how many wights are behind the gate.
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon arrives at the gate. He pins a wight to the gate with Longclaw as Tormund and Karsi kill the wights that have already gotten through. The archers take out the wight Jon pinned to the gate, and then the men cover the hole the wights had been escaping from with a sled.
s05e08	Hardhome	Fighting continues. A group of wights tear into a Crow. Loboda and Karsi continue to kill the wights.
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon looks up through the mist and sees 4 White Walkers on horseback on the top of the cliff.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: The Dragonglass!
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: You’re with me, lad! Now!
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon and Loboda charge towards the cabin. Jon cuts a wight in half then kills another. The giant breaks through a wall in the cabin as the cabin starts to go down in flames. He shakes the wights off of his back, snapping some in half and stomping others into pieces. Jon and Loboda storm the cabin.
s05e08	Hardhome	INT. HARDHOME - CABIN
s05e08	Hardhome	The entire cabin is on fire. A White Walker wielding a staff walks towards them through the fire.
s05e08	Hardhome	LOBODA: Get the glass.
s05e08	Hardhome	Loboda walks towards the White Walker as Jon scrambles towards the Dragonglass. Loboda misses with his axe twice, getting it caught in the wall. He pulls it out to parry in time, but the Walker’s spear shatters his axe. The Walker plunges his spear through Loboda's stomach.
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon reaches the glass but is thrown across the room by the Walker before he can pick it up, causing Longclaw to fly out of the cabin. Jon ducks from the Walker’s swings with his spear, and runs out to grab another sword. The Walker swings and shatters the sword. He knocks Jon down again. Jon struggles, then gets up again, running to pick up Longclaw. He stumbles and drops the sword. The White Walker staggers towards him. Jon picks up Longclaw just in time to match the White Walker, and to both of their surprises, Longclaw stops the Walker’s spear. The Walker deflects one blow from Jon, but then he swings and shatters the Walker into pieces.
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon falls to the ground after the struggle. The Night’s King watches him alone from the top of the cliff.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - GATE
s05e08	Hardhome	Tormund and Karsi continue to tear through wights. Karsi looks up, and sees a group of blue-eyed wight children staring at her. They do nothing for a moment, then charge at her, chewing and clawing her to death.
s05e08	Hardhome	Cut to Jon crawling across the snow, coughing up blood. A man grabs him and Jon puts Longclaw to his neck. The man turns out to be Edd and they lower their weapons.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: The Dragonglass!
s05e08	Hardhome	EDD: Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here.
s05e08	Hardhome	A screech comes from the top of the cliff. Hundreds of wights dive from the top of the cliff. They appear to have died for a brief moment after landing, but then wake up and charge at Jon and Edd.
s05e08	Hardhome	Cut to Tormund continuing to hold the gate. The gate starts creaking then comes down. Tormund runs to the boat.
s05e08	Hardhome	The giant starts roaring as the other gate comes down, swinging a fiery log. Jon, Tormund, and Edd sprint towards the boat with the giant clearing a path for them with the log. The Night’s King continues to watch them from the top of the cliff.
s05e08	Hardhome	EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon, Tormund, and the Crow jump off the dock onto the boat.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Go! Go! Go!
s05e08	Hardhome	TORMUND: Wun Wun, to the sea.
s05e08	Hardhome	The giant stays back, continuing to take out loads of wights by swinging his flaming log. He begins to walk towards the boat, ripping the wights hanging onto him off of his back and throwing them into the water to die.
s05e08	Hardhome	JON: Let’s go now! Now!
s05e08	Hardhome	Jon looks back to shore to see the Wights, along with a White Walker, killing the last surviving wildlings.
s05e08	Hardhome	Slowly, a figure walks to the end of the dock. The camera pans up to reveal the Night’s King. He stares at Jon and Jon stares back. The Night’s King turns his head to the carnage at the edge of the shore and then looks back to Jon. He slowly starts raising his arms.The dead wildlings twitch, then open their eyes to reveal blue. Karsii comes back to life, blue-eyed . They all start standing up, joining the army of the dead, and staring at Jon. Jon can do nothing but stare back at the Night’s King back as the boat drifts away.

s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Melisandre stares into the fire. She exits the tent.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP - NIGHT
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Melisandre surveys the camp. In the distance, a tent catches on fire. Men start screaming and rushing out of their tents. A burning horse runs by Melisandre.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Horses?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: We’re not returning to Castle Black.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Stannis looks to Melisandre and Selyse. Davos follows his gaze then looks back.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Stannis walks over to Melisandre.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. THE WALL
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The Hardhome survivors, led by Jon, Tormund, Tollett, and Wun-Wun, approach the wall. Alliser looks down at the group. Jon steps forward, Alliser stares for a moment, then--
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ALLISER: Open the gates.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The lower gate is lifted.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. CASTLE BLACK
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The Hardhome Wildlings are being escorted through Castle Black.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JON: It was a failure.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SAM: It wasn’t.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JON: I went to save them, I failed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SAM: You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JON: I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Cut to many men of the Night’s Watch glaring at Jon, then Olly who exchanges a long look with Jon from the top of the stairs. Alliser walks down the steps to Jon.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ALLISER: You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. STANNIS’ TENT
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Stannis is studying his chessboard. There are 2 Baratheon pieces next to a sword and opposed to 2 Bolton pieces. Davos enters the tent.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: You sent for me, Your Grace.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Yes.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: My family stays with me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: My family stays with me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The men are shivering, waiting in line for food. Davos walks by.

s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Shireen is reading one of her books. Davos enters.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: What’s this one now?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: "The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling" by Grand Maester Munkun.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Well that sounds like a proper story.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: And burnt him to a crisp.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Davos and Shireen share a laugh.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Davos hands her a stag carved out of wood.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Do you like it?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: He’s beautiful.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Shireen kisses him on the cheek.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Thank you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: You’re very welcome.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Of course I will.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: But why am I getting a present?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAVOS: Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: You’ll just have to read it yourself.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Davos kisses Shireen on her forehead then leaves. Shireen looks over the stag.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. DORNE - PALACE
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jaime is escorted by Areo to Doran’s room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Prince Doran. (bows)
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Princess Myrcella.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MYRCELLA: Uncle.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: What a lovely dress.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MYRCELLA: You don’t like it?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: You must be cold.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MYRCELLA: Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TRYSTANE: A fleabite.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: What are you doing in Dorne?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jaime looks at Ellaria.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MYRCELLA (surprised): That necklace was stolen from my room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Doran looks at Ellaria. A servant sets down food and drink before Jaime.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Everyone drinks. Ellaria dumps her cup out on the floor and looks at Doran.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: I’m afraid he does.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: I cannot disobey my King’s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: I accept.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: You have my word.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: The word of a Kingslayer.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Ellaria gets up and walks to Doran.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Ellaria tries to leave the room. Doran grabs her wrist.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Doran lets go. Ellaria leaves the room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: May I inquire into the fate of my man?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jaime looks to Trystane. Trystane considers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TRYSTANE: I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: You’re a good man.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TRYSTANE: On one condition.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. DORNE - CELL
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Bronn is laying on the ground in his cell. Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game where one tries to slap the other’s hand before they pull their hands away. Nymeria slaps Tyene.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	NYMERIA: Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYENE: You’re going to miss.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	NYMERIA: I never miss.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYENE: You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?”
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Nymeria slaps at Tyene and Tyene gets out of the way in time.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	NYMERIA: Luck.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYENE: Now it’s my turn.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	NYMERIA: You’re too slow. You’ve always been too slow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Nymeria sticks her hands out and blows a kiss to Tyene. Tyene slaps her across the face then blows one back. They get in fighting stances as the guards arrive. They take Bronn out of his cell.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BRONN: Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	AREO: You’ll find out very soon.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Bronn starts leaving the prison.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYENE: Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BRONN: The most beautiful woman in the world.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYENE: And that’s the truth!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	NYMERIA: Slut.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Tyene laughs.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. DORNE - PALACE
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Areo escorts Bronn into Doran’s room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: : I didn’t realize there were knights of the Blackwater.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BRONN: Only the one.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BRONN: Prince. Sorry about the other day.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BRONN: I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: There was one condition.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jaime nods to Areo. Areo elbows Bronn in the jaw, knocking him to the ground.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: Perhaps some soup instead?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya pushes her oyster cart through the street.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Two shady looking men approach her.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MAN: How much for your little clam?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	They laugh and walk away. Arya looks down the street and sees the Thin Man, looking over another sailor’s application.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya stops her cart, inspects the vile Jaqen gave to her, and tucks it back in her pouch. She starts pushing the cart again and makes eye contact with the Thin Man.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	THIN MAN (waving): Come on.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya stares off into the distance.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	THIN MAN: Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya looks to the dock, and sees Meryn Trant and Mace Tyrell being helped off the boat. A Iron Banker approaches him and Arya starts walking away from the Thin Man and towards them.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: I’m afraid I don’t partake.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya studies the group, focuses in on Meryn, and begins following them with her cart.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. BRAAVOS - IRON BANK
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Meryn and Arya exchange quick looks at each other.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: Most unfortunate for the glovers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Mace gestures to the Iron Bank and the camera cuts to it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	EXT. IRON BANK - LATER
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya is waiting on the steps of the building opposite the bank, eating her oysters. The men start walking out of the Bank.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BANKER: I don't have that gift.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MACE: It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Meryn Trant and his men walk through the doorway.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MAN: It wasn’t bad, though.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	They arrive at a door.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MAN: You’re buying?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: Oh, I’m buying. But I never was good at sharing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	They enter the brothel. Arya pulls up to the doorway with her cart and sees the men entering.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. BROTHEL
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya walks through the door with a tray of oysters. The brothel keeper stops her.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	BROTHEL KEEPER: Sell your fish somewhere else.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	PROSTITUTE: Oh let her in, Brusco, I’m hungry. Come here, sweetness.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The brothel keeper gestures nods for Arya to go on. She walks to the prostitute and the man she’s with.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	PROSTITUTE: They say oyster’s get the juices flowing. We’ll take half a dozen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ARYA: Three coppers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya begins cutting an oyster open.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JOHN: Here’s a silver because the lady likes you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The man places a silver on her tray in exchange for the oysters. Arya turns and sees Trant’s men being taken to a back room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. BROTHEL - BACK ROOM
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya enters the room and peers through a divider to see a prostitute posing for Meryn.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: Too old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HEAD PROSTITUTE: Brea.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Brea poses for Meryn.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: Too old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HEAD: I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	A younger, 20-something prostitute poses for Meryn.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: Too old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The people in the room share uneasy glances as they realize what he’s asking for.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: Do you have what I want or not?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HEAD: Of course. Of course.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	One of Trant’s men crosses to the other side of the divider and confronts Arya.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MAN: Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The man drags her into the room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MAN: Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MAN 2: I’ll have one.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Meryn stares at Arya.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HEAD: Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The head prostitute brings in a child.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: Good.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The head prostitute hands Meryn an hourglass. He hands it back.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: I’ll tell you when we’re done.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	He leads the girl towards a bedroom.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MERYN: You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HEAD: Of course.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The head prostitute realizes Arya is still standing there.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HEAD: I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya leaves the room, but takes one last glance at where Meryn is taking the girl.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jaqen kneels next to a man at the fountain of the center of the room and offers him a drink from the fountain.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MAN: Valaar morghulis.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The man takes a drink. Arya approaches Jaqen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAQEN: And?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ARYA: The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAQEN: Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The man drops to the ground, creating a thud off-screen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ARYA: Tomorrow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAQEN: Tomorrow.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAQEN: A girl has work to do.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Arya walks towards the man who is now collapsed on the ground.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. DORNE - PALACE
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Doran is addressing Ellaria with Areo standing guard next to the three Sand Snakes.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	She kneels and kisses his ring, crying. Nymeria and Obara look disgusted, Tyene’s face reveals less.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DORAN: I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jaime is writing a letter in his former cell that is now unlocked. Ellaria enters.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: You write like a 7 year old.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: He didn’t try to make you pay?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: She will.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: You love her very much, don’t you?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JAIME: Of course, she’s my niece.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: I wasn’t talking about her.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jaime looks up from his writing at Ellaria.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Ellaria pauses, taking a walks around the room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ELLARIA: I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Ellaria exits the room.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	INT. SHIREEN’S TENT
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Shireen plays with her stag figurine next to a fire and on top of her book. Stannis enters the tent.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Father. Aren’t you cold?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: No. What are you reading?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: The Dance of Dragons.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: What’s it about?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: “The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: That’s just what they call it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Doesn’t make much sense.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: I think it’s poetic.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: It’s alright, father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Yes there is.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	They hug.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: Forgive me.

s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Shireen is flanked by guards as she walks towards a pyre, clutching the stag Davos gave her. When she arrives at the pyre Melisandre steps to the front.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Where’s my father? I want to see my father.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MELISANDRE: It will all be over soon, Princess.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The men drag her to the pyre and tie her up.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Stannis watches on from the crowd.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SELYSE: It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MELISANDRE: The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SELYSE: If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MELISANDRE: Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SELYSE: I can’t.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STANNIS: There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	MELISANDRE: Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	SHIREEN: Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Melisandre lights the pyre. Selyse runs towards the pyre and is stopped by Stannis’ men. Shireen burns as Melisandre, Selyse, and Stannis look on, Melisandre pleased, Selyse horrified, and Stannis conflicted.

s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Daenerys sits next to Missandei at the top of the pit, with an open seat between her and Tyrion at the end, and Daario standing behind them. Hizdahr takes the open seat.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: Where have you been?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: Just making sure everything’s in order.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Camera pans through the fighting pit to reveal it is covered with House Targaryen sigils. An announcer steps to the middle of the pit and waves his arm to silence the crowd.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ANNOUNCER (Valyrian): Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The Announcer raises his hands and the crowd begins to roar. Cut to Daenerys’ box - she and Missandei look disgusted, Daario looks impressed. Two gladiators enter the pit.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ANNOUNCER: My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph: the strong or the quick?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	QUICK: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	STRONG: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	They stand waiting in front of her. The crowd is silent.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Daenerys looks down at the two men. After a moment, and with a look of disgust on her face, she claps her hands. The crowd roars and they start fighting. After some parries, the Quick man slices at the Strong man’s neck.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAARIO: That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: The smaller man it is.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: I’m not putting my money anywhere.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAARIO: People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Hizdahr is silent.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAARIO: Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The Strong man decapitates the Quick man with one quick stroke. Hizdahr smiles and Daario looks turns away angrily. Tyrion says nothing.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: You don’t approve?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Cut to pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit, leaving a trail of blood behind.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: That is greatness?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: My father would have liked you.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ANNOUNCER: We ask again: who will triumph?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: At your command?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: If need be.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ANNOUNCER: A Meereenese champion?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The crowd applauds.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: How many people will die to make this happen?
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR (looks at pit): Those men think they’re dying for a good reason.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: Someone else’s reason.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	ANNOUNCER: ...or a Westerosi Knight?!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Crowd jeers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JORAH (O.S.): I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Daenerys stares at Jorah. They both hold back emotion.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: Your Grace--
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAARIO: Shut your mouth.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Daenerys claps. Jorah nods. They begin fighting, with Daenerys’ eyes following Jorah. He takes a blow to the mouth, is knocked down and starts bleeding. He gets up, has his sword knocked away, and pulls out a dagger. He wrestles with the man trying to choke him, throws him off, then stabs him in the chest. He pulls the dagger out, looking at Daenerys, throws it away, and picks up his longsword.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jorah squares off against a flashy fighter that just brutally stabbed another fighter through the back. He slices Jorah in the cheek. The other two fighters square off, with a heavily armored fighter wielding a spear killing his opponent. The crowd cheers.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jorah’s opponent slices Jorah’s arm then knocks him over, knocking his sword out of his hand. He holds his blade to Jorah’s throat. Both he and Jorah look to Daenerys.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: You can end this.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: She cannot.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: You can!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The fighter holds his blade to Jorah’s throat. He is about to make a move when the other fighter comes over and stabs Jorah’s opponent in the back, killing him. Jorah gets up and faces the final opponent. Jorah matches the spearman, is knocked over, but catches the spear before it reaches his throat. He gets back up and the two face off again. Jorah spins, somersaults, and stabs him through the stomach, killing him. He looks up to Daenerys.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jorah reaches for his opponent’s spear. He picks it up and hurls it towards Daenerys’ seat. Daario rushes to protect Daenerys and everyone else gets out of the way. It connects with a Son of the Harpy.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Cut to the crowd. Many audience members have put on Sons of the Harpy masks.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAARIO: Protect your queen!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	The Sons of the Harpy start slitting the throats of former slaves and Unsullied in the crowd. Unsullied guards and Daario surround Daenerys and Missandei, fighting off the Harpys. Hizdahr starts running towards Daenerys.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	HIZDAHR: Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Two Sons of the Harpy come up on Hizdahr from behind and stab him to death. They run at Daenerys. Daario takes one out, and Jorah comes up from the pit to take Hizdahr’s spot and take out the other. He offers his hand to Daenerys and she takes it. He leads her down to the pit with Daario and the Unsullied, leaving Tyrion and Missandei.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	A Harpy comes towards Missandei. Tyrion comes from behind, pulls him to his knees, and slits his throat. He leads her down to the pit.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	TYRION: Stay close!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Sons of the Harpy have began to rush the pit. Unsullied fight them off as Daenerys, Daario, and Jorah head towards a side exit.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	JORAH: This way!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	They run through the exit, but a door swings shut. A Son of the Harpy steps out and Jorah kills him.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAARIO: The other side, follow me!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	They rush towards the other side and join up with Tyrion and Missandei.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAARIO: Protect your queen!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Jorah, Daario, and the Unsullied form a ring around Missandei, Daenerys, and Tyrion in the center of the pit. Sons of the Harpy begin to rush from the other exit they were heading towards. They surround the ring, testing out the outer ring before they begin rushing. A few make it past the outer ring but are killed by Daario. Missandei and Daenerys join hands and Daenerys closes her eyes.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	A roar is heard in the distance. All of the Harpys look up. Drogon appears, breathing fire and circling the pit. The Sons run away from Daenerys to the edge of the pit. One charges at her and Drogon rips him apart. He breathes fire on 4-5 of them at a time before a spear hits his back. 2 more spears connect and he starts slowing down.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: Drogon!
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	She takes a spear from his neck. He roars at her, but then closes his mouth. She slowly reaches to touch his nose. More spears are thrown at him by Sons of the Harpy and he turns to them and roars. Daario continues to fight off every Harpy that comes near her.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Daenerys climbs onto Drogon’s back slowly.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	DAENERYS: Valahd..
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	Drogon runs towards the Harpys, starts flapping and then takes off from the Pit. He flies past the Pyramid and into the sky as Tyrion, Jorah, Daario, and Missandei stare up at him.
s05e09	The Dance of Dragons	A dragon roars in the distance.

s06e01	The Red Woman	Pan down from the inside of The Wall towards Castle Black. GHOST is howling. Slow zoom to JON SNOW’s body, lying in the snow. A sign with the word “TRAITOR” is posted on a beam behind him. Closeup on JON SNOW. He is staring upwards, lifelessly. GHOST howls louder and pushes against the door to his pen.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - DAVOS’ CHAMBER
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS hears GHOST’s howling and exits, then peers across the courtyard and sees JON SNOW’s body. He immediately runs down the steps. He slows as he approaches JON SNOW’s body. Other brothers of the Night’s Watch approach. DAVOS kneels beside JON SNOW’s body.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN: It’s the Lord Commander!
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD and other Night’s Watchmen rush up behind DAVOS.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: Help me get him inside.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The other Night’s Watch brothers pick up JON SNOW’s body and carry it away. DAVOS remains, staring at the left over pool of blood.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD wipes the table clean. The other Night’s Watch brothers place JON SNOW’s body on the table. DOLOROUS EDD places his hand on JON SNOW’s wounds, then brushes JON SNOW’s eyes closed.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD: Thorne did this.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD: Trust? The men in this room.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: Does the wolf know you?
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD looks at DAVOS over his shoulder and nods.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: We need all the help we can get.
s06e01	The Red Woman	As DOLOROUS EDD moves towards the door, someone knocks on it. The Night’s Watch brothers draw their blades.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MELISANDRE (O.S.): Ser Davos.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD looks over his shoulder at DAVOS. DAVOS nods. The Night’s Watch brothers sheathe their swords. DOLOROUS EDD walks to the door and opens it. MELISANDRE enters. DOLOROUS EDD closes the door behind her. MELISANDRE is distressed at the sight of JON SNOW’s body.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MELISANDRE: I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: I can’t speak for the flames, but he’s gone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MELISANDRE touches JON SNOW’s cheek.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE sits at the high table among the other leaders of the Night’s Watch. The rest of the Night’s Watch brothers are shouting at each other.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MALE VOICE #1: He was our Lord Commander!
s06e01	The Red Woman	MALE VOICE #2: He never should have been!
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE pounds his fist three times on the high table, then stands. The room quiets.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: You all know why you’re here. Jon Snow is dead.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: Who killed him?
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: I did.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The Night’s Watch brothers resume shouting.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMEN #1: Murderers!
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: Traitors!
s06e01	The Red Woman	The shouting resumes. OLLIE walks up beside the high table. ALLISER THORNE pounds the high table again.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: You’re right!
s06e01	The Red Woman	The shouting stops.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The men begin to murmur among themselves.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM
s06e01	The Red Woman	GHOST nudges JON SNOW’s hand and whimpers.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: He’ll have seen we didn’t come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD: I don’t care who’s sitting at the high table. Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him. Now we return the favor.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: We don’t have the numbers.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD: We have a direwolf.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: It’s not enough. I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD: If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: We need to fight, but we don’t need to die. Not if we have help.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN: Who’s gonna help us?
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: You’re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD’s washes over with realization. He turns to the Night’s Watchman at his side.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD: Bolt the door. Don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back as soon as I can.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DOLOROUS EDD leaves through the door.
s06e01	The Red Woman	Two men sit on horses on a hill outside Winterfell. They carry flags bearing the flayed man sigil of House Bolton.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY (V.O.): She was 11 the first time I saw her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - ROOM
s06e01	The Red Woman	MYRANDA’s body lies on a table.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: The kennelmaster’s daughter. She smelled of dog. I wasn’t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. You certainly were.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY turns and looks at MAESTER WOLKAN, then looks back at MYRANDA’s body..
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: Myranda wasn’t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn’t do.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY stands and places his hand on MYRANDA’s forehead.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY looks as though he is going to cry.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MAESTER WOLKAN: Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: Buried, burned?
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY walks past MAESTER WOLKAN as he exits the room.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY is walking with ROOSE.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE: Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: No.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE: A shame.  I’d reward the man.  Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY and ROOSE stop walking. RAMSAY looks back over his shoulder at ROOSE.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE: I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: No.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE walks past RAMSAY into Winterfell’s great hall.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE: A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RAMSAY: I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won’t get far.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE: I’m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well…
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE sits at the dinner table. RAMSAY stares at him, astonished.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ROOSE: ...let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA and THEON are running through the woods frantically. The barking of dogs can be heard in the distance. SANSA tires. THEON runs back to hear and pulls her onward.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: We can’t stop.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The pair resume running. They happen upon a large, snowy river.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: We have to cross here.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA steps on a patch of thin ice and gasps.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA: I can’t.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: It’s the only way to throw off the hounds.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA: But it’s too cold. I can’t. I won’t make it. I’ll die.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: I’ve seen what his hounds do to a person. This way is better.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON guides SANSA into the water. SANSA gasps at the cold. The both wade across.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON and SANSA are walking together. They are blue with cold. Barking can no longer be heard. THEON spots something off camera.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: Over here. Come on.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON leads SANSA to an overturned tree. Its roots provide shelter from the snow. They sit down under the roots, shivering.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: Sansa. Sansa.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON wraps his arms around SANSA. She rests her head on his shoulder and closes her eyes. Dogs barking can suddenly be heard closeby.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: Stay here. I’ll lure them away.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA: No, I won’t make it without you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: You will. Go north, only north. Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black. He’ll help you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON runs into the woods but is immediately confronted by House Bolton soldiers and hounds.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BOLTON OFFICER: Where is Lady Bolton?
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: Dead.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BOLTON OFFICER: Liar.
s06e01	The Red Woman	THEON: She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts. I left her to die in the snow.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The dogs catch SANSA’s scent and begin barking. They lead the soldiers to SANSA under the roots of the tree. SANSA cowers from them.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BOLTON OFFICER: I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.
s06e01	The Red Woman	One of the soldiers grabs SANSA and pulls her to her feet. A horse whinnies in the distance. The soldiers draw their weapons. BRIENNE and PODRICK ride towards the soldiers with their sword drawn.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BOLTON OFFICER: It’s a bloody woman.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BRIENNE cuts down BOLTON OFFICER as she rides past. PODRICK engages one of the soldiers in mounted combat. BRIENNE faces off with another mounted soldier. Their blades clash, but neither is hit. As BRIENNE rides past him, another soldier knocks her from her horse. She drops her blade but scrambles to retrieve it when she sees a soldier advancing towards her on foot. When she reaches the blade, the soldier kicks her. She retrieves the blade again and stands, engaging him in a swordfight. She cuts him down. A mounted soldier charges at BRIENNE. She jumps and strikes him, causing his horse to fall over, trapping him beneath it. While PODRICK continues his mounted sword fight, THEON grabs the blade of a fallen soldier off the ground. PODRICK cuts down the soldier he is fighting and they both fall from their horses. Another soldier advances on PODRICK, and they begin fighting. BRIENNE crawls over to the man trapped beneath his horse and slits his throat with a dagger. The soldier PODRICK is fighting knocks PODRICK’s sword out of his hand. PODRICK falls to the ground. Just before the soldier is about to strike PODRICK, THEON stabs the soldier from behind. PODRICK stands up. BRIENNE walks over to SANSA. SANSA stands up to confront her. BRIENNE places her blade on the ground in front of SANSA and kneels before her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BRIENNE: Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again. I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA turns at looks at THEON for confirmation. THEON nods his head.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA: And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and…
s06e01	The Red Woman	PODRICK: Meat and mead at my table.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SANSA: Meat and mead at my table. And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BRIENNE stands up. SANSA smiles at BRIENNE.
s06e01	The Red Woman	A ship with sails bearing the sun and spear sigil of House Martell approaches the Red Keep.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI is sitting in the dark by a table. The door to her chamber opens and a handmaiden enters.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HANDMAIDEN: Your Grace, I’m sorry to disturb you. A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI smiles.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: Myrcella…
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: RED KEEP - COURTYARD
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI runs through the courtyard and out to the harbor. She descends the steps to the harbor where a small boat is coming to shore. Her smile fades. As the small boat gets closer to shore, it is revealed to be carrying JAIME and a casket. CERSEI begins to tear up.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME is standing on the balcony, looking out. A bell tolls in the background. JAIME turns and looks back into CERSEI’s room, then enters it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: Mother.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI begins to tear up.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI:  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME walks over to CERSEI and kneels in front of her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: Shh, shh. Don’t think about it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: I have to. I have to. It’s not right she has to suffer alone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: She’s not suffering. She’s gone. No one can hurt her anymore.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI (crying): She was good. From her first breath, she was so sweet. I don’t know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness, no jealous, just good.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: I know.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I’m not a monster.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: Listen -- listen to me. She was my daughter and I failed her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they’d die. “And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true. You couldn’t have stopped it. It’s prophecy. It’s fate.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: You don’t believe that.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CERSEI: Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME places his hand on CERSEI’s cheek..
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn’t us. We’re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they’ve taken from us, we’re going to take back and more.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME embraces CERSEI.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JAIME: We’re going to take everything there is.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SEPTA UNELLA is reading scripture  to MARGAERY.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SEPTA UNELLA: “The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men. They scream in agony and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames, for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved.”
s06e01	The Red Woman	MARGAERY: I’d like to see my brother.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SEPTA UNELLA: Confess.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MARGAERY: Please. How is he? At least tell me that.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SEPTA UNELLA: Confess.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MARGAERY: I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SEPTA UNELLA: Sinners don’t make commands. They make confessions.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SEPTA UNELLA slams the scripture book closed and approaches MARGAERY aggressively.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The door opens and HIGH SPARROW enters.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW: Septa Unella.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW sighs.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW: Our other guests need you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	SEPTA UNELLA exits. HIGH SPARROW walks over to MARGAERY and gently pulls her hair away from her face.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW (whispering): There.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MARGAERY looks up at HIGH SPARROW.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW: Septa Unella can be overzealous at times. I’ll speak with her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MARGAERY: My brother, can you tell me how he is?
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW sits on a stool beside MARGAERY.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW: It isn’t Ser Loras that brings me here. Your husband misses you dearly. The love between a man and wife is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for all of us. But sin leads us away from the sacred. And only confession can purge sin.
s06e01	The Red Woman	MARGAERY: I have nothing to confess.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW: So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?
s06e01	The Red Woman	MARGAERY: None of us are.
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW: You have started down the path. But you have many miles to go..
s06e01	The Red Woman	HIGH SPARROW exits. MARGAERY hugs her knees.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ELLARIA is assisting DORAN to his wheelchair. They are accompanied by TYENE, AREO, and several guards.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN: I always envied Oberyn. He lived. He truly lived. Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ELLARIA: And men.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN: And men. He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed. But that is life. We each have our roles.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN sits in his wheelchair. ELLARIA places a pillow behind him.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN: Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. And I was born to rule.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ELLARIA: The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler.
s06e01	The Red Woman	A maester approaches.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN (to TYENE): Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?
s06e01	The Red Woman	MAESTER: Prince Doran.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The maester bows and hands DORAN a scroll. DORAN unravels and reads it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN: The Princess Myrcella…
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYENE produces  a dagger from her boot and stabs AREO in the back, killing him. ELLARIA produces a dagger of her own and stabs DORAN in the chest. The maester tries to run away, but TYENE retrieves her dagger from AREO’s body and throws it into the back of the maester’s neck, killing him. ELLARIA removes her dagger from DORAN’s chest and pushes him to the ground. The remaining guards do nothing.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ELLARIA: When was the last time you left this palace? You don’t know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing. You’re not a Dornishman. You’re not our prince.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN is bleeding out on the ground. He gasps for air.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN: My son Trystane…
s06e01	The Red Woman	ELLARIA scoffs.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ELLARIA: Your son is weak just like you. And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DORAN dies.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER
s06e01	The Red Woman	TRYSTANE is painting an eye on a stone. OBARA and NYMERIA enter. TRYSTANE does not look at them.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TRYSTANE: I told you I’m not hungry.
s06e01	The Red Woman	OBARA: We’re not here to feed you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TRYSTANE stands and turns around to look at them.
s06e01	The Red Woman	OBARA: We’re here to kill you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	OBARA walks to the opposite side of the room. NYMERIA remains by the door. TRYSTANE reaches for his sword.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NYMERIA: You want her to do it or me?
s06e01	The Red Woman	TRYSTANE: We are family. I don’t want to hurt you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NYMERIA: Her or me?
s06e01	The Red Woman	TRYSTANE draws his blade and points it at NYMERIA.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NYMERIA: Good.
s06e01	The Red Woman	OBARA: Smart boy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TRYSTANE steps between the two women, readying himself to fight NYMERIA. OBARA stabs him through the back of his head with her spear.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NYMERIA: You’re a greedy bitch, you know that?
s06e01	The Red Woman	OBARA and NYMERIA exit.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION and VARYS are walking through the streets together.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: We’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS looks over his shoulder at a passing commoner.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: We’ll be fine. We’re dressed like common merchants.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: You walk like a rich person.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.
s06e01	The Red Woman	A woman is lying in the street holding a baby. TYRION and VARYS approach.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION (speaking Valyrian): For your baby. To eat.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The woman cowers away from TYRION.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS (to TYRION): She thinks you want to eat her baby.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS kneels.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS (speaking Valyrian): His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS hands the woman money. She gestures at them to thank them, and they walk on. They walk into a courtyard where “KILL THE MASTERS” is written in red on a wall. Beneath it, “MHYSA IS A MASTER,” is written.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: I know what mhysa means.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: Who wrote it?
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: The Sons of the Harpy?
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION and VARYS enter a chamber where a red priest is preaching to a group of listeners.
s06e01	The Red Woman	LISTENERS (speaking Valyrian): For the night is dark and full of terrors.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RED PRIEST: The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
s06e01	The Red Woman	RED PRIEST: How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you  you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: It’s a problem.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION and VARYS proceed in a much larger courtyard.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know.
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: And have you started looking for that someone?
s06e01	The Red Woman	VARYS: My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.
s06e01	The Red Woman	Men are shouting in the distance. A bell begins to toll. A flood of people run through an archway on the opposite side of the courtyard toward TYRION and VARYS, then run past them. TYRION and VARYS proceed through the archway and into the harbor. Smoke pours from the burning wreckage of all the ships in the harbor.
s06e01	The Red Woman	TYRION: Well, we won’t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH and DAARIO are riding horses across the countryside. Cut to JORAH kneeling. He is lifting the charred skull of a ram. DAARIO remains on his horse.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: Goat?
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: Ram.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: You think our friend got him?
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: Don’t know anything else that can melt a ram’s horn.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: We’re on the right path, then.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH and DAARIO return to their horses. They proceed across the countryside.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: Perhaps she’s tired of being queen. I don’t think she likes it very much.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: She’s too smart to like it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: Maybe she’s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: I’ve been all over the world. There’s no escaping men like us.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: There’s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back. Why?
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: You know why.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back?
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: Of course it is.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: You’re a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think, “So that’s what I’ll be like when I grow old.”
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: If you grow old.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: So do I.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH stops his horse. DAARIO proceeds ahead. JORAH pulls back his sleeve and looks at the growing patch of Greyscale on his forearm. The men resume riding in unison. They pull up on a circular swathe of horse tracks. There is a smaller circle of untouched grass in the center of the swathe.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: Huh, an army?
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: Not an army. A horde.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH dismounts his horse and walks to the circle of untouched grass.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAARIO: Dothraki?
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH looks down and sees something in the grass. He bends down and retrieves a ring.
s06e01	The Red Woman	JORAH: They have her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The Dothraki horde is traveling together in great numbers. DAENERYS is walking beside the horse of two Dothraki bloodriders. DAENERYS trips. BLOODRIDER #1 whips her. Both men laugh. They speak in Dothraki.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #1: Maybe she saw a ghost. My friend’s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #2: Pink people are afraid of the sun. It burns their skin. This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #1: You think she’s got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #2: Only when I was fucking your grandma.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #1 chuckles and makes a kissing sound at DAENERYS.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #1 (to DAENERYS): I’ll ask Khal Moro for a night with you. What do you think?
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #2: Pretty eyes, but she’s an idiot.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #1: She doesn’t have to be smart to get fucked in the ass.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #2: I like to talk when I’m finished. Otherwise, we might as well be dogs.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: ESSOS ARID LANDS - DOTHRAKI SETTLEMENT
s06e01	The Red Woman	The Dothraki folk are tending to their affairs. BLOODRIDER #1 and BLOODRIDER #2 escort DAENERYS to KHAL MORO’s tent. KHAL MORO is sitting with his wives and other bloodriders.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #2: For you, my Khal. The white-haired girl we found in the hills.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #1 pushes DAENERYS towards KHAL MORO. KHAL MORO considers her. The attendants speak in Dothraki.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #3: Look at those lips, blood of my blood.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WIFE #1: Blue-eyed women are witches.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WIFE #2: It is known.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WIFE#1: Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO stands and walks around DAENERYS.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO: Even if I was blind, I’d hear my wives say, “Cut off her head” and I’d know this woman was beautiful. I’m glad I’m not blind. Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #3: Killing another Khal?
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO: Yes, killing another Khal.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #4: Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves, and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.
s06e01	The Red Woman	BLOODRIDER #3: Breaking a wild horse, forcing it to submit to your will.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO (annoyed): Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is among the five best things in life.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO grabs DAENERYS by the chest.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): Do not touch me.
s06e01	The Red Woman	The bloodriders and wives look at each other. KHAL MORO released DAENERYS.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAENERYS: I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO and his bloodriders laugh. He places his hand on the back of DAENERYS’ head
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO: You are nobody, the millionth of your name, Queen of Nothing, slave of Khal Moro. Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son. Do you understand?
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAENERYS: I will not lie with you. And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WIFE #1: I told you she was a witch. Cut off her head.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO: I like her. She has spirit.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAENERYS: I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO takes his hand away from DAENERYS and steps backwards.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO: Khal Drogo is dead.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAENERYS: I know. I burnt his body.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO: Forgive me. I did not know. It is forbidden to lie with a Khal’s widow. No one will touch you. You have my word.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO draws his blade and cuts DAENERYS’ bindings.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAENERYS: If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO: When a Khal dies, there is only one place for his Khaleesi.
s06e01	The Red Woman	KHAL MORO sits down.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WIFE #1: Vaes Dothrak. The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WIFE #2: To live out her days with the widows of dead Khals. It is known.
s06e01	The Red Woman	An older man walks through the street carrying a basket. He walks past a beggar. The beggar is revealed to be ARYA. Another man walks up and places a coin in ARYA’s beggar bowl.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ARYA: Thank you.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ARYA falls silent and listens to the chatter of the common folk. The waif of the House of Black and White appears carrying two staves.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WAIF: Are you listening, blind girl? Do you hear them talking? Do any of them talk to you? No. So sad.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WAIF holds out one of the staves and throws it at ARYA. ARYA catches it clumsily. WAIF hits ARYA with the other staff, knocking her over.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WAIF: Stand and fight, blind girl.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ARYA stands, holding the staff out in front of her.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ARYA: I can’t see.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WAIF: That’s your problem, not mine.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WAIF strikes ARYA on the leg. ARYA cries out and swings her staff. She misses. WAIF jabs ARYA in the stomach with the end of the staff, then knocks her to the ground. ARYA stands back up and swings her staff. She misses again. WAIF strikes ARYA in the face with her staff twice. The second blow knocks ARYA over. ARYA stands up and swings for a third time. She misses again. WAIF strikes ARYA several more times, then knocks her to the ground again. ARYA tries to get up by leaning on her staff, but WAIF knocks the staff out of her hands.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WAIF: See you tomorrow.
s06e01	The Red Woman	WAIF walks away. ARYA remains on her knees, panting.
s06e01	The Red Woman	Several Night’s Watch brothers allied to ALLISER THORNE are pointing crossbows at the room that DAVOS and the other Night’s Watch brothers allied with JON SNOW are holed up. ALLISER THORNE approaches the door to the room with several men and knocks. The Night’s Watch brothers inside draw their sword and GHOST growls. DAVOS stands up and walks to the door. ALLISER THORNE knocks again.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight. We are both anointed knights.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: I will grant amnesty to all brothers who thrown down their arms before nightfall. And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south, a free man with a fresh horse.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: And some mutton. I’d like some mutton.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: What?
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: I’m not much of a hunter. I’ll need some food if I’m gonna make it south without starving.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE: We’ll give you food. You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like. Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose. But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: Thank you, Ser Alliser. We’ll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.
s06e01	The Red Woman	ALLISER THORNE and his men leave.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: Boys, I’ve been running from men like that ll my life. In my learned opinion, we open that door --
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: And they’ll slaughter us all.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: They want to come in, they’re gonna come in.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: Aye, but we don’t need to make it easy for them.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: Edd is our only chance.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: It’s a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: There’s always the Red Woman.
s06e01	The Red Woman	NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: What’s one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?
s06e01	The Red Woman	DAVOS: You haven’t seen her do what I’ve seen her do.
s06e01	The Red Woman	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - MELISANDRE’S CHAMBER
s06e01	The Red Woman	MELISANDRE is sitting at the edge of her bed by a fire. She looks across the room at a small mirror standing on a table, then walks over to it.

s06e02	Home	YOUNG NED helps YOUNG BENJEN to his feet.
s06e02	Home	BRAN (to THREE-EYED RAVEN): That’s my father. And my Uncle Benjen.

s06e02	Home	YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN begin sparring again. BRAN looks around the commons at the citizens of Winterfell going about their business.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: They were all so happy.
s06e02	Home	THREE-EYED RAVEN: So were you once.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG LYANNA rides into the courtyard on a horse. She circles around YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG NED: Stop showing off.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG BENJEN: Lyanna!
s06e02	Home	BRAN: My Aunt Lyanna. I’ve seen her statue in the crypt. My father never talked about her.
s06e02	Home	Closeup on THREE-EYED RAVEN. He turns to look at BRAN, but BRAN has already walked away. BRAN walks closer to the group. YOUNG LYANNA is being helped off her horse by YOUNG HODOR.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG BENJEN: Would you get out of here? We’re sparring.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG LYANNA: Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?
s06e02	Home	YOUNG BENJEN: I don’t know.

s06e02	Home	YOUNG LYANNA: What about him?
s06e02	Home	YOUNG NED: Wylis, come here.
s06e02	Home	BRAN turns to look at YOUNG HODOR. THREE-EYED RAVEN reaches BRAN’s side.

s06e02	Home	YOUNG BENJEN: But he’s got giant’s blood.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG NED: And you’ve got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG LYANNA: Benjen always lifts his chin when he’s about to charge.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG HODOR takes the sword and shield.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG HODOR: And lowers it when he’s going to dodge, my lady.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: Hodor talks?
s06e02	Home	YOUNG HODOR walks over to YOUNG BENJEN. They both ready to commence sparring, but stop when NAN appears.
s06e02	Home	NAN: You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis. Come along, now. It’s no place for you.
s06e02	Home	NAN takes YOUNG HODOR by the ear and leads him away.
s06e02	Home	YOUNG NED: Oh, Nan, look at the size of him. If he ever learned to fight, he’d be unstoppable.
s06e02	Home	NAN: Well, he’s never going to learn to fight because he’s a stable boy. So leave him be.
s06e02	Home	THREE-EYED RAVEN (to BRAN): It is time to go.

s06e02	Home	BRAN is released from the vision. He gasps, then lets go of the root. The white fades from his eyes. A CHILD OF THE FOREST is sitting nearby, staring at him. He props himself up on his wrists and looks at THREE-EYED RAVEN.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.
s06e02	Home	THREE-EYED RAVEN: It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, you’ll drown.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: I wasn’t drowning. I was home.
s06e02	Home	CHILD OF THE FOREST and THREE-EYED RAVEN exchange a glance. BRAN turns to HODOR, who is sitting with his back against a wall.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: Wylis.
s06e02	Home	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: I saw you as a boy. You could talk. What happened?
s06e02	Home	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: Where’s Meera?
s06e02	Home	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e02	Home	HODOR carries BRAN outside and sets him down in the snow. MEERA is sitting in the snow at the base of the great weirwood, staring out at the tundra.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: You shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe outside the cave.
s06e02	Home	MEERA: It’s not safe anywhere.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: I saw that Hodor wasn’t always Hodor.
s06e02	Home	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: His real name is Wylis. And he could talk and fight and -- and then --
s06e02	Home	MEERA turns and looks at BRAN.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: What’s wrong?
s06e02	Home	MEERA casts her eyes down and looks away.
s06e02	Home	BRAN: The Three-Eyed Raven says there’s a war coming.
s06e02	Home	MEERA: And we’re going to fight it in there.
s06e02	Home	MEERA scoffs and turns away. HODOR picks BRAN up and carries him back inside. A side view of MEERA reveals the same CHILD OF THE FOREST who was watching BRAN, sitting among some stones and frozen shrubbery..
s06e02	Home	CHILD OF THE FOREST: Brandon Stark needs you.
s06e02	Home	MEERA: For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.
s06e02	Home	CHILD OF THE FOREST: He isn’t going to stay there forever. And out there he needs you.
s06e02	Home	The Night’s Watch members allied to ALLISER THORNE are poised with crossbows pointed at the room DAVOS and the other Night’s Watch members faithful to JON SNOW are in. ALLISER THORNE is outside the door to the room, accompanied by several others who are loyal to him. Inside the room, JON SNOW’s body remains on the table. DAVOS, the faithfuls, and GHOST are all standing.
s06e02	Home	ALLISER THORNE: It’s time, Ser Davos. Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace. We’ll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs. Nobody needs to die tonight.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS turns to address the Night’s Watch faithfuls.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: I’ve never been much of a fighter.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS walks over to Longclaw, JON SNOW’s sword, and picks it up.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Apologies for what you’re about to see.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS unsheathes Longclaw. The faithfuls follow suit, drawing their own blades.ALLISER THORNE turns to address a Night’s Watchman.
s06e02	Home	ALLISER THORNE: Come on.
s06e02	Home	The Night’s Watchman lifts and large hammer and walks over to the door. He begins slamming the hammer against the door repeatedly. GHOST begins to growl and bark. DAVOS and company ready themselves for battle. After a number of swings, the Night’s Watchman with the hammer breaks a hole in the door. A loud thudding can be heard somewhere behind ALLISER THORNE and company. They turn to see what the noise is. The thudding is coming from one of the courtyard’s main gates. WUN WUN breaks down the gate and the Wildlings led by TORMUND and DOLOROUS EDD rush into the courtyard. The Night’s Watch loyal to ALLISER THORNE have bows drawn at the Wildlings but do not fire. They back up slowly.
s06e02	Home	ALLISER THORNE: Attack!
s06e02	Home	ALLISER THORNE draws his sword. A Night’s Watchman charged TORMUND. TORMUND cuts him down. The other Night’s Watch members do not retaliate.
s06e02	Home	ALLISER THORNE: Fight, you cowards!

She’s never seen anything like it. I mean, she’s used to her brother, and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister’s half an inch shy of an inch. She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips.

s06e02	Home	MISSANDEI: They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.
s06e02	Home	TYRION: Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious.
s06e02	Home	GREY WORM: If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?
s06e02	Home	TYRION: Dragons do not do well in captivity.
s06e02	Home	MISSANDEI: How do you know this?
s06e02	Home	TYRION: That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.
s06e02	Home	TYRION finishes his glass of wine and walks over to the pitcher to pour himself another glass.
s06e02	Home	TYRION: The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?

s06e02	Home	TYRION: When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.”
s06e02	Home	TYRION sets down his torch and gets closer to RHAEGAL.
s06e02	Home	TYRION: Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.

s06e02	Home	YARA: Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day.
s06e02	Home	BALON: And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will.
s06e02	Home	BALON exits the hall.
s06e02	Home	CUT TO: PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE
s06e02	Home	Rain is pouring down. BALON begins to cross the unsteady bridge. He leans on the ropes and looks down at the ocean, then sees a cloaked figure on the other side of the bridge.
s06e02	Home	BALON: Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king.
s06e02	Home	HOODED FIGURE: Haven’t I always, brother?
s06e02	Home	The hooded figure takes off his hood, revealing his identity. He is EURON GREYJOY. BALON walks a few steps closer.
s06e02	Home	BALON: I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
s06e02	Home	EURON: What is dead may never die.
s06e02	Home	BALON does not respond.
s06e02	Home	EURON: Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
s06e02	Home	BALON: You can mock our god without my help.
s06e02	Home	EURON: I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.
s06e02	Home	The wind buffets the bridge back and forth. BALON tries to hold his balance. EURON chuckles.
s06e02	Home	EURON: You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule.
s06e02	Home	BALON walks towards his brother.
s06e02	Home	BALON: I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
s06e02	Home	EURON: They did.
s06e02	Home	BALON: And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.
s06e02	Home	EURON: I needed silence.
s06e02	Home	BALON: What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?
s06e02	Home	EURON: I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way.
s06e02	Home	BALON draws a knife and slashes EURON across the face. EURON throws BALON off the bridge. BALON falls to his death.
s06e02	Home	CUT TO: PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY
s06e02	Home	Many Ironborn are in attendance for BALON's funeral. AERON GREYJOY and several Drowned Men are gathered around BALON's body. They are performing funeral rites, covering it with rocks, seaweed, and wood. YARA approaches. YARA and the Drowned Men walk BALON's body through the shallows.
s06e02	Home	AERON: Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.
s06e02	Home	ALL: What is dead may never die.
s06e02	Home	YARA: I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.
s06e02	Home	AERON: The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
s06e02	Home	YARA: My father would’ve wanted me to rule.
s06e02	Home	AERON: Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE is sitting at the fireplace. Someone knocks on the door.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: Come in.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS enters.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: I'm sorry, my lady. I didn’t mean to interrupt.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: You interrupt nothing.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS looks at the fireplace and then at MELISANDRE.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: I assume you know why I’m here.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: I will after you tell me.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: It’s about the Lord Commander.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: The former Lord Commander.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Does he have to be?
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: What are you asking?
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: If you want to help him, leave him be.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Can it be done?
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: There are some with his power.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: How?
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: I don’t know.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Have you seen it done?
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn’t have been possible.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: But it was. It could be now.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: Not for me.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE stands and walks away from her chair. DAVOS walks towards her.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS comes a step closer to MELISANDRE
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: I never had this gift.
s06e02	Home	DAVOS: Have you ever tried?
s06e02	Home	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM
s06e02	Home	DAVOS, TORMUND, DOLOROUS EDD, and MELISANDRE are gathered around JON SNOW's body. GHOST is sleeping on the floor. MELISANDRE is performing a ritual on JON SNOW's body. She wrings out a wet cloth with which she cleans out the wounds of JON SNOW. She cuts his hair and beard and throws the hairs in a firepit. Then she places her hands on JON SNOW's chest and utters an incantation in Valyrian. She sighs.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE: Please.
s06e02	Home	MELISANDRE lets her hands down slowly. She has tears in her eyes and looks to DAVOS. TORMUND scoffs and exits, followed by MELISANDRE and DOLOROUS EDD. DAVOS lingers and stares at JON SNOW's body, but eventually exits. GHOST suddenly wakes up and looks at JON SNOW. JON SNOW's eyes snap open and he gasps for breath.
s06e02	Home	Far beyond the Wall, Bran hones his visionary abilities with the Three-Eyed Raven.
s06e02	Home	Alliser Thorne and his betrayers begin the assault on Davos and the Night’s Watch faithfuls, but are met with a powerful surprise.
s06e02	Home	At King’s Landing, Tommen bars Cersei from attending Myrcella’s funeral. During the funeral, Jaime counsels Tommen until they are encountered by the High Sparrow. Tommen goes to Cersei’s chamber to reconcile with his mother.
s06e02	Home	In Meereen, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, and Grey Worm hold council. Daenerys' absence has caused her authority to crumble. Tyrion acts upon a dangerous plan.

s06e02	Home	On Pyke, a storm is raging. Balon Greyjoy meets an unlikely foe.
s06e02	Home	At Castle Black, Davos pleads with Melisandre to bring Jon Snow back to life. Though Melisandre has lost her faith, Davos convinces her to try.
s06e02	Home	From HBO:
s06e02	Home	Bran trains with the Three-Eyed Raven. In King’s Landing, Jaime advises Tommen. Tyrion demands good news, but has to make his own. At Castle Black, the Night’s Watch stands behind Thorne. Ramsay Bolton proposes a plan, and Balon Greyjoy entertains other proposals.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS is staring at JON SNOW. JON SNOW slowly sits up on the table, breathing heavily. He turns his head to look at DAVOS. GHOST is standing in front of JON SNOW, also staring at him. JON SNOW looks down at his body and sees his stab wounds. He begins gasping and shaking. DAVOS takes off his cloak and rushes over to JON SNOW. JON SNOW attempts to stand but falters. DAVOS catches JON SNOW and wraps him in his cloak.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS: Easy, easy. Easy.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS ushers JON SNOW back into a sitting position. MELISANDRE enters and stares at JON SNOW.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS: What do you remember?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn’t be here.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS: The lady brought you back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MELISANDRE approaches JON SNOW and kneels in front of him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MELISANDRE: Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: Nothing. There was nothing at all.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MELISANDRE: The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS (to MELISANDRE): Could you give us a moment?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MELISANDRE rises and exits the room. DAVOS closes the door behind her, grabs a stool, and sits down in front of JON SNOW.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS: You were dead. And now you’re not. That’s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS: I don’t know. Maybe we’ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAVOS: Good. Now go fail again.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOLOROUS EDD, TORMUND, the faithful Night’s Watch members, and the Wildlings are all gathered in the courtyard, staring up at the entrance to the room JON SNOW was in. JON SNOW emerges on the balcony, supported by DAVOS. He stares out at the crowd, then walks down the steps with the help of DAVOS and begins walking through the crowd. The men on either side part to let him pass. TORMUND walks up the middle to confront JON SNOW.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TORMUND: They think you’re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: I’m not a god.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TORMUND: I know that.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TORMUND moves closer to JON SNOW and whispers in his ear.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TORMUND: I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW and TORMUND both chuckle and embrace. JON SNOW winces, then spies DOLOROUS EDD and begins walking towards him. They embrace, and JON SNOW winces again.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOLOROUS EDD: Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOLOROUS EDD laughs.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOLOROUS EDD: That’s funny. You sure that’s still you in there?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Both men laugh.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	A storm is raging, causing rough wind and water to buffet the vessel back and forth. GILLY peers out at the storm through a window in the hull of the ship and smiles.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CUT TO: VESSEL - HOLD
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY is sitting on the edge of a cot with LITTLE SAM. Various crewmembers are going about their business. SAMWELL is huddled over a bucket, quivering. He groans and gags. GILLY approaches him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: You all right?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: Yes. Yes, I’m fine.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: I don’t think so.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: Sea, see. They’re spelled different, but they sound the same.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: Yeah, they do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: It was before I learned how to read, obviously.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL scrunches up his face.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: Sam, are you going to be sick?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL shakes his head and then vomits into the bucket. GILLY retrieves a water skin and hands it to SAMWELL. He washes out his mouth with water.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: Won’t be long. We’ll be in the south soon. I’m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it’s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: No. No, no, no. The Citadel doesn’t admit women. There won’t be a place for you there or for Little Sam.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: I stayed at Castle Black. There’s no women allowed there.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: The Citadel isn’t Castle Black. I don’t have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: I’ll stay in Oldtown, then.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: By yourself? With a baby and no money?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY stands.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: So if we’re not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: To my home. Horn Hill. My father’s -- well, my father, but my mother’s a kind woman and my sister’s lovely. They’ll take care of you both.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: “Wherever you go, I go, too.” That’s what you said.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY returns to LITTLE SAM and sits down on the cot. SAMWELL rises and follows her.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: I said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe. That’s all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you’ll be safe
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: Us and everyone else in the world.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: I don’t care about them. Well, no, I do, but I don’t really. I care about you and him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY places her hand on SAMWELL’s back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: If you think it’s for the best, we trust you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL: I’d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GILLY: I’d never do that to the father of my son.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SAMWELL smiles and looks at LITTLE SAM, then vomits into a bucket and coughs.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED STARK rides towards the Tower of Joy with six companions. One of the companions is HOWLAND REED.  Two Kingsguard are sitting at the foot of the tower, one of which is ARTHUR DAYNE.When they see the horses approaching, they retrieve their gear and walk out to meet them. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are standing on an outcropping, watching events unfold. NED dismounts his horse.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: That’s my father.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera’s father.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The Kingsguard walk past BRAN and THREE-EYED RAVEN.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: Ser Arthur Dayne.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: The Sword of the Morning.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED and his companions confront the Kingsguard. ARTHUR stabs his sword into the dirt.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: Lord Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED: I looked for you on the Trident.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: We weren’t there.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	KINGSGUARD: Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED: The Mad King is dead. Rhaegar lies beneath the ground. Why weren’t you there to protect your prince?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: Our prince wanted us here.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED: Where’s my sister?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR and the other Kingsguard put on their helmets.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: And now it begins.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The Kingsguard draw their blades.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED: No. Now it ends.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED and his men draw their blades and attack. ARTHUR cuts down HOWLAND. The other Kingsguard runs one of NED’s men through with his sword. NED engages in single combat with the other Kingsguard and stabs him through the throat. NED and his three remaining men surround ARTHUR. NED and his men attack all at once, but ARTHUR deflects all of their blows repeatedly, then repositions himself. He kills one of NED’s men with a downward strike from both of his blades. NED and the two remaining men advance on ARTHUR. ARTHUR deflects their blows again and slices the throat of another man, then runs another through with his blade. NED engages ARTHUR in single combat.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: He’s better than my father.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: Far better.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: But Father beat him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: Did he?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: I know he did. Heard the story a thousand times.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR traps NED’s blade and wrenches it from his hands. ARTHUR makes a motion to strike NED down, but HOWLAND stabs ARTHUR in the back. ARTHUR falls to his knees.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: He stabbed him in the back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED retrieves a sword and slashes ARTHUR with it, killing him. A woman screams from the Tower and NED storms towards it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: What’s in the tower?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: That’s enough for one day. We’ll visit again another time.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: I want to see where he’s going.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: Time to go.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: Father!
s06e03	Oathbreaker	NED stops on the stairs and turns around in the direction of BRAN’s yelling but sees nothing and proceeds up the stairs. BRAN chases after him but is intercepted by the THREE-EYED RAVEN, who touches him on the shoulder.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The white leaves BRAN’s eyes as the vision fades. The THREE-EYED RAVEN is tangled in his roots. A child of the forest looks on. BRAN crawls towards the THREE-EYED RAVEN.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: Why did you do that? Take me back there. I want to go back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: No.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: He heard me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: He heard me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: The past is already written. The ink is dry.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: What’s in that tower? I want to go back there.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: I’ve told you many times, stay too long where you don’t belong and you will never return.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: So why did you?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: I was waiting for you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: I don’t want to be you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: I don’t blame you. You won’t be here forever. You won’t be an old man in a tree. But before you leave, you must learn.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BRAN: Learn what?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	THREE-EYED RAVEN: Everything.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAENERYS is entering Vaes Dothrak with the horde. A mounted Bloodrider ushers her onward with a nudge of his foot.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BLOODRIDER (speaking Dothraki):  Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAENERYS approaches a domed structure. KHAL MORO and two of his Bloodriders are waiting for atop their horses.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	KHAL MORO: Welcome home, Khaleesi.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Another Bloodrider ushers DAENERYS into the building. Inside, DAENERYS stands in front of a platform atop which a middle-aged Dothraki woman is standing. A group of younger Dothraki women encircle DAENERYS. They speak in Dothraki.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOTHRAKI WOMAN: Go.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The Bloodriders who ushered DAENERYS in exit. The older Dothraki woman nods to the younger women, who swarm DAENERYS and remove all of her clothing.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAENERYS: What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!
s06e03	Oathbreaker	One of the younger woman approaches DAENERYS with a simple brown garment, which DAENERYS takes and wears.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAENERYS: You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOTHRAKI MATRON: We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion’s heart. Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAENERYS: Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOTHRAKI MATRON: You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didn’t. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. You’re young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DAENERYS: Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOTHRAKI MATRON: Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow. With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS is sitting on the steps of the throne, fanning himself. Several Unsullied stand around the perimeters of the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS (to an Unsullied): I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Two Unsullied usher a woman into the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: If we could have the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	All the Unsullied guards exit.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: You look lovely today, my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WOMAN: If you’re going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: I am not a torturer.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS stands.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: Though it so often is what people deserve.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS approaches the woman.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: And it does provide answers. But they’re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I’d like to make you happy, Vala. That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VALA looks away. VARYS chuckles.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: That’s all right. I know who you are and what you’ve done. You’ve done a lot. You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VALA: The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: I understand. Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective. I have a different perspective, of course. I think it’s important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours. Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy. That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I’m afraid I don’t really speak the language. Such a handsome boy. Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VALA: Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VALA: If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me. So either you kill me or they do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS kicks a large brown bag at his feet.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or…

s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting together around a table. TYRION smiles at MISSANDEI, and MISSANDEI smiles back. TYRION smiles at GREY WORM, and GREY WORM remains expressionless.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI and GREY WORM look at each other, then at TYRION.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION (to MISSANDEI): You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI says nothing.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREY WORM: Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: That’s good. That’s very good.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION stands and carries his wine glass over to the decanter to refill it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI: Who said this?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION returns to the table. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI say nothing.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREY WORM: Games are for children.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI: My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: There, that’s a start.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI: Only the girls.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI: We do not drink.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: Until you do.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look interrogatively at TYRION.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: Alright. No drinking. We can play without drinking. It’s a wonderful game. I invented it. Here’s how it works. I make a statement about your past. If I’m wrong, I drink. And if I’m right -- Maybe we can’t play without drinking.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS enters the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: Oh, you took your time.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can’t rush.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI: You found out?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREY WORM: We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREY WORM: If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI: We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION nods.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: You may be right.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREY WORM: So we will fight them?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: Possibly.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MISSANDEI: Possibly?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: It’s a conversation.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION turns to VARYS.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TYRION: Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	VARYS: Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	INT. RED KEEP - VAULTS
s06e03	Oathbreaker	A group of Varys' child spies are gathered together. One LITTLE BIRD picks up a model of a planet. Another child plays with an hourglass.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How’s your mother’s jaw?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: Better.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: And your father?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: No one’s seen him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	LITTLE BIRD: Will Lord Varys ever come back?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: I don’t think so. Do you miss him?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	LITTLE BIRD: He was nice.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARTHUR: He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN stands up and walks to a table.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: It’s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	He nods at the boxes. Eeach child picks one. They nibble at the plums.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The door opens. GREGOR walks in, followed by JAIME and CERSEI.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. He’s friends with all my friends.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREGOR looks at the children. They stare at him, motionless.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: Run along now.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The children run up the stairs.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI: Varys's little birds?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: Your little birds now, your Grace.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME is admiring GREGOR.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME: What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN: Oh, a number of things.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME: Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	GREGOR turns his head to JAIME. JAIME recoils.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURNS: He understands well enough.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME: So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI: The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME: Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI: Not yet.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME: That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI (to QYBURN): Don’t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	QYBURN bows his head to CERSEI.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CUT TO: RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
s06e03	Oathbreaker	KEVAN LANNISTER chairs a meeting of the Small Council. MAESTER PYCELLE, MACE TYRELL and LADY OLENNA have all gathered around him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MAESTER PYCELLE: As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. He’s arrogant, dangerous. You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice, so here we are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR enter the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MAESTER PYCELLE: And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this, this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MAESTER PYCELLE notices the new guests. He farts.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	KEVAN: Can I help you?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI (to LADY OLENNA): Why are you here?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MACE TYRELL: My mother...
s06e03	Oathbreaker	LADY OLENNA: I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI: Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	LADY OLENNA: Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	KEVAN (to CERSEI & company): This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME: I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI: Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	MAESTER PYCELLE: Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME pushes two chairs to the table. JAIME and CERSEI sit down. MAESTER PYCELLE keeps his mouth. The members of the Council look at JAIME and CERSEI.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI (to KEVAN): What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAIME: The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CERSEI: And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	KEVAN: No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	One by one, KEVAN LANNISTER, LADY OLENNA and MACE TYRELL leave the room. MAESTER PYCELLE picks up his paperwork and shuffles slowly. He then runs out of the door when SER GREGOR looks at him threateningly. JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR are left alone in the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The HIGH SPARROW is praying. TOMMEN enters the room with his guards. The HIGH SPARROW stands up.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: Oh, your Grace.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That’s not possible. Not yet.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: When will it be possible?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: When she's fully atoned for her sins.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Several Faith Militant gather behind the HIGH SPARROW.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: I am the king.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: You are.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: And what does that mean to you?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN walks closer to the HIGH SPARROW. He guards tense.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The HIGH SPARROW signs that his guards need to leave. They leave. TOMMEN puts his hand in the air and points to his guards. They leave. HIGH SPARROW closes the book lying on the table behind him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn’t come from this world. But you know that. You’ve felt it. You’ve seen her when she talks to you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: Yes.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: It’s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW points to a bench in the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: Of course.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW sighs and sits down.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: It’s not what I want. It’s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The HIGH SPARROW palms the seat next to him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: Please.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN sits down next to him.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	TOMMEN: My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	HIGH SPARROW: The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There’s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The WAIF and ARYA are standing on a raised platform. The WAIF scrapes her staff on the floor around ARYA, then pushes the end of it against ARYA's head. ARYA turns around. The WAIF nudges her and she flinches. Cut to the WAIF and ARYA sitting on the ground across from each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: Who are you?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: No one.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The WAIF hits ARYA with a stick. ARYA falls on the ground but gets up.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: Who were you before you came here?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: Arya Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut to ARYA and the WAIF on the combat platform.  ARYA tries to fight but the WAIF beats her. ARYA falls to the ground. Her mouth's bleeding. Cut back to the WAIF and ARYA sitting across from each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: Tell me about Arya Stark’s family.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The WAIF corrects her with a whip of the stick. Cut to the fighting platform. The WAIF kicks ARYA's staff back into her grasp. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: Three brothers.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut back to the fighting platform. As ARYA speaks each of her brothers' names, the WAIF strikes her.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA (V.O.): Rob, Bran, Rickon. And a half-brother, Jon.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: And where are they now?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut to ARYA standing in front of a small table. Several bowls are filled with powder. A glass bottle stands behind each bowel.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA (V.O.): They may be dead for all a girl knows.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA sniffs one of the bowls of powder, then recoils. She sniffs another bowl and wafts the scent with her hand. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: Tell me about The Hound.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut back to the fighting platform.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA (V.O.): Also dead.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA deflects several of the WAIF's blows, but is pushed to the edge of the platform and falls when the WAIF smacks her across the face with her staff.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut to the pair sitting across from each other. The WAIF smacks ARYA with the stick.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: Why? Didn’t she want him dead any longer?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut back to the power table.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: She did and she did not.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA lifts a spoon of the powder to the jar behind it. The Faceless Man, taking on the form of JAQEN H'GHAR, looks on. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: She sounds confused.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: Yes, she was.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut back to the powder table. ARYA dumps the spoonful of powder in the bottle. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: Who else was on Arya Stark’s funny little list?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut back to the fighting platform. The WAIF beats down ARYA repeatedly until ARYA can no longer get up.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA (V.O.): Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	The WAIF walks away from ARYA, but stops when ARYA begins to stand up. The WAIF turns back to face ARYA.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: That’s a short list. That can’t be everyone you want to kill.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA stands up and holds her staff out at the WAIF. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	WAIF: Are you sure you’re not forgetting someone?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: Which name would you like a girl to speak?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Cut back to the fighting platform. ARYA and the WAIF exchange blows, but ARYA knocks back the WAIF. JAQN H'GHAR looks on.The WAIF returns with a heavy blow, but ARYA blocks it. The WAIF walks away. ARYA turns to face JAQEN H'GHAR.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	CUT TO: HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA is sitting in front of a fireplace. JAQEN is standing in front of the well in the center of the room.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAQEN: If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA: A girl has no name.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAQEN: Come.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA walks to the well. JAQEN gives ARYA a bowl of water. ARYA hesitates to drink it.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAQEN: If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ARYA drinks the water. She closes her eyes. She slowly opens them to reveal the blindness has left them. She looks to JAQEN.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JAQEN: Who are you?

s06e03	Oathbreaker	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - DINING HALL
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY and LORD KARSTARK are seated at the dining table. A lady serves them drinks. SMALLJON is standing in front of them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	LORD KARSTARK: Famously loyal to the Starks.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: And you, Lord Karstark? Your people share blood with the Starks, don’t they?  But here we are. Times change.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: Your father was a cunt.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: My beloved father, the Warden --
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him.  I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: My father was poisoned by our enemies.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: Mmm.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We’re farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: So now you’ve come seeking help?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: We need to help each other.  The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take them long to get here.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	LORD KARSTARK: You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.  He knows this place better than we ever will.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: Pledge your banners to House Bolton.  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: I’m not kissing your fucking hand.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: I’m not doing that either.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. I've got a gift for you.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Two hooded people are dragged into the hall.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: A girl, aye.  A wild one.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON pulls the hood off one of the people, revealing OSHA. RAMSAY stands up.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: I like them wild.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: And the boy, nice and young. The way Karstark likes them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	LORD KARSTARK stands up. SMALLJON pulls the hood off the other person, revealing RICKON STARK.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: Who’s this?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJON: Rickon Stark.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	RAMSAY: How do I know that’s Rickon Stark?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	SMALLJOY retrieves the severed head of Rickon's direwolf SHAGGYDOG and places it on the table. RAMSAY examines the head, looks at SMALLJON, and then smiles at RICKON.

BOWEN MARSH, OTHELL YARWICK, ALLISER THORNE, and OLLY are standing on a platform with their hands tied and ropes around their necks. JON SNOW looks up at them.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: If you have any last words, now is the time.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	BOWEN MARSH: You shouldn’t be alive. It’s not right.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: Neither was killing me.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	OTHELL YARWICK: My mother's still living at White Harbor. Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ALLISER THRONE: I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	ALLISER THRONE: I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW looks at OLLY. OLLY stares back at him, unwavering. JON SNOW turns his back and unsheathes Longclaw. He breathes heavily. JON SNOW cuts the rope. The platform is pulled out from under the traitors’ feet. They are hung. They choke and die. JON SNOW looks at OLLY again. OLLY's face is blue and swollen. JON SNOW sheathes his sword, then walks up to DOLOROUS EDD.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOLOROUS EDD: We should burn the bodies.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: You should.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW takes off his cape and hands it to DOLOROUS EDD.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	DOLOROUS EDD: What do you want me to do with this?
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW walks down the stairs.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	JON SNOW: My watch is ended.
s06e03	Oathbreaker	Everyone in attendance watches JON SNOW walk away.

s06e04	Book of the Stranger	INT. CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	Longclaw is lying on a table. DOLOROUS EDD lifts and admires it, then turns to JON SNOW who is putting some items in a bag.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOLOROUS EDD: Where you gonna go?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: South.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOLOROUS EDD: What are you gonna do?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: Get warm.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW smiles. DOLOROUS EDD places Longclaw on the table.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOLOROUS EDD: I was with you at Hardhome. We saw what’s out there. We know it’s coming here. How can you leave us now?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: I did everything I could. You know that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOLOROUS EDD: You swore a vow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: Aye, I pledged my life to the Night’s Watch. I gave my life.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOLOROUS EDD: For all nights to come.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	A single horn sounds outside. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD look to the doorway.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN (O.S.): Riders approaching!
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #2 (O.S.): Open the gate!
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The southern gates open. SANSA, BRIENNE, and PODRICK enter the courtyard on horseback. The Night’s Watch and the Wildlings all watfch them. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. The trio dismount from their horses. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD emerge onto a balcony overlooking the courtyard. SANSA slowly spins around until she and JON SNOW lock eyes. JON SNOW descends from the balcony and walks to SANSA. They stare at each other and then embrace.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW and SANSA are sitting by the fire. SANSA lifts a bowl to her lips and drinks from it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: This is good soup. Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: With the peas and onions?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Mmm.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: We never should have left Winterfell.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don’t go, you idiot.”
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: How could we know?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: We were children.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: I was awful, just admit it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW chuckles.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: You were occasionally awful. I’m sure I can’t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Can you forgive me?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: There’s nothing to forgive.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Forgive me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: All right. All right, I forgive you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA laughs, then holds out her hand for JON SNOW’s horn of ale. JON SNOW gives it to her. She sips, then coughs. JON SNOW laughs.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Where will you go?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Where will we go?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: I can’t stay here, not after what happened.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: There’s only one place we can go. Home.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: We’ll take it back from them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: I don’t have an army.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: How many wildlings did you save?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: They didn’t come here to serve me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: They owe you their lives.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA stands and walks to a table. She places her bowl down on it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: Sansa.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Winterfell is our home. It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: I’m tired of fighting.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW stands and turns to face SANSA.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: If we don’t take back the North, we’ll never be safe. I want you to help me. But I’ll do it myself if I have to.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MELISANDRE is looking out over the edge of the balcony. DAVOS approaches her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: My lady.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MELISANDRE: Ser Davos.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: Will you stay here at Castle Black?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MELISANDRE: I will do as Jon Snow commands.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: You serve Jon Snow now?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MELISANDRE: He’s the prince that was promised.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MELISANDRE walks away from DAVOS and down into the courtyard. DAVOS follows her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: What happened down there?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MELISANDRE: There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MELISANDRE continues to walk away, but DAVOS grabs her arm to stop her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: And Shireen? What happened to the princess?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BRIENNE approaches.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BRIENNE:  I saw what happened. I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BRIENNE: We’ve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BRIENNE stares at MELISANDRE.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: That’s in the past now.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BRIENNE: Yes, it’s in the past. It doesn’t mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAVOS: Who did?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BRIENNE: Stannis. Just before I executed him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BRIENNE walks away. MELISANDRE walks in the opposite direction. DAVOS stares at BRIENNE.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN is aiming at a target with a bow and arrow. He shoots, but the arrow falls short. YOHN ROYCE sighs to himself. ROBIN looks to YOHN ROYCE for approval. YOHN ROYCE smiles. A carriage approaches, accompanied by several knights. The knight driving the carriages dismouts and extends the carriage steps. LITTLEFINGER emerges from the carriage.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): The Defender of the Vale!
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN: Uncle Petyr!
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN drops the bow and arrow and runs to LITTLEFINGER. They embrace.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: My lord. Come and see.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER ushers ROBIN to the rear of the carriage.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: I missed your name day. Go on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN and LITTLEFINGER pull a sheet from the back of the carriage, revealing a cage with a falcon inside. The falcon squawks. ROBIN gasps.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN: A falcon!
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE: Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: Indeed I was.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE: And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE: Do you take me for a fool?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The ensuing conversation momentarily distracts ROBIN from admiring the falcon. YOHN ROYCE approaches LITTLEFINGER slowly.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE: Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE looks to ROBIN.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN: Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The surrounding knights begin to approach YOHN ROYCE. YOHN ROYCE walks closer to ROBIN.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE: My lord. My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father, to your mother, and now to you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN: Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE turns back to look at LITTLEFINGER.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE turns back to ROBIN.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE: You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN: Fine.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YOHN ROYCE bows and walks a few feet away from the engagement.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	ROBIN: She’s my cousin. We should help her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: That was my instinct as well.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER turns and walks towards YOHN ROYCE.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LITTLEFINGER: Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	A ship is entering the harbor. TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are standing on the shore watching its approach.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: You invite the enemy into our city?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION begins walking away. The others follow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies. I kill the queen’s enemies.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION and VARYS begin ascending the stairs to the Great Pyramid.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI: Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION and VARYS turn back to face MISSANDEI and GREY WORM.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes. Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI: How many days were you a slave?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION stammers.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Long enough to know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI: Not long enough to understand.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION and VARYS proceed up the steps. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting in attendance to three masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YEZZAN: I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It’s most impressive.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAZDAL: We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	BELICHO: We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAZDAL: When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI: She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAZDAL: As they have since the dawn of time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: Not anymore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YEZZAN: You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Friends, friends, friends, please.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM stares intently at YEZZAN.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YEZZAN: Slavery is the way of our world.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YEZZAN: What does that mean?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The masters look at each others.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YEZZAN: We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION picks up a bell from the table beside him and rings it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	Three women enter. Each one sits in the lap of one of the masters.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION exits. VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM follow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	A group of commoner representatives are gathered together at the foot of the throne, whispering in Valyrian. TYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM enter on the throne platform.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION (speaking Valyrian): My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI (to TYRION): Perhaps I should translate for you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #1: We speak the Common Tongue.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Excellent.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #2: You met with the slavers today.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: I did.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #1: Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION begins to descend the steps towards the men. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #1: You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #2: When does she return?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Soon. You have my word.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #1: We don’t know you. We don’t trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #2: You have made peace with the slavers?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: We offered terms.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #1 (speaking Valyrian): And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): I am a soldier, not a politician. But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN #2 (speaking Valyrian): Missandei, you know what these men are. How can you trust them?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): I do not trust them. I will never trust them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI pauses and looks at TYRION.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION smiles.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI are walking together.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: Do not use me for your lies.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: Those men respect you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: As do I.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI: You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: For a short time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MISSANDEI: Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: You are wrong to trust these men.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: You don’t know them. You don’t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TYRION: They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	GREY WORM: You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	EXT. ESSOS MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH and DAARIO are walking to the top of a mountain crag. JORAH lags behind and stops to catch his breath. DAARIO turns back to him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: I’m fine.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO chuckles.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: I don’t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: What?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: Our queen. She’s wild, you know. Don’t let her size fool you. It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man. You, I don’t think your heart could take it.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH stares at DAARIO for a few moments and then continues along the path.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: Must make you angry that our queen chose me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: Makes me sad. You’ll disappoint her before long. She’ll move on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: We’ll all disappoint her before long.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH turns back to face DAARIO.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: We need each other right now. After we’re done needing each other --
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: You didn’t get much discipline as a child, did you?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: None.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH and DAARIO crawl to the edge of the ridge and look below. Vaes Dothrak sprawls across the valley floor.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH points to the eastern division of Vaes Dothrak, and then to the western division.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: Eastern Market, Western Market. When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals. That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH stands and walks off to the side. He begins undoing his sword belt.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: What are you doing?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: If they spot us and we’re unarmed, we’ll say we’re traders heading for the Western Market. But if they see weapons…
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: There’s 100,000 of them down there. We can’t fight our way out. We wait till dark, and then we’ll find her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO hands over his weapons, except for his dagger. JORAH holds his hand out for the dagger.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DARRIO: Uh…
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO flips the knife around in his hand.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: I’m very attached to this knife.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO kisses and strokes the knife, then motions to hand it to JORAH. He spots the patch of greyscale on JORAH’s arm through a hole in his sleeve. JORAH pinches the fabric of his sleeve together to cover up the greyscale.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: Don’t worry. it didn’t touch you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: You know what happens?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: I know what happens.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO gestures with the dagger.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: I’ll do it myself.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH walks to the side and stares into space.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	Dothraki men and women are celebrating in the streets. JORAH and DAARIO are sneaking through the stables. They crouch down in front of a railing and see a Dothraki man and woman fornicating.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: I should have been born a Dothraki.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH and DAARIO sneak into an alleyway. They move through the alley, but spot two Dothraki men coming their way. JORAH grabs DAARIO.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: Come on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAN and DAARIO walk out to greet the Dothraki men. They proceed to speak in Dothraki.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOTHRAKI #1: What do you sell?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOTHRAKI #1: You’re not merchants.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The Dothraki man inclines his head towards his fellow man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOTHRAKI #1: Get the others.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The second Dothraki man runs down the alleyway. DAARIO darts after him. JORAH swings at the first Dothraki man, but misses. The Dothraki man knees him in the face, knocking him to the ground. DAARIO continues to pursue the other Dothraki man. JORAH strikes his foe twice, but both are blocked. The Dothraki man strikes back with a punch to the face that sends JORAH sprawling. In the alley, just before the other Dothraki man reaches the common area, DAARIO grabs him from behind, places his hand over his mouth, and then snaps his neck. JORAH is rebuffed by his foe a third time. He attempts to throw sand in the Dothraki man’s face, but he dodges out of the way. JORAH climbs to his knees, but the Dothraki man grabs him by the throat and begins choking him. DAARIO stabs the Dothraki man from behind, killing him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: Told you, I’m very attached to this knife.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO tucks the dagger away in his shirt. JORAH climbs to his feet.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: You all right?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO grabs a large rock and smashes the dead Dothraki man with it several times.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: Huh.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS is sitting among the Dosh Khaleen. The women whisper among themselves, but the leader sits beside DAENERYS. They begin to speak in Dothraki.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LEADER: Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They are stupid old women. They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood. This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Twelve.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LEADER: A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter. How did he show his happiness?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: He broke my ribs.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LEADER: We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: That is more than most have.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LEADER: When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: I need to make water.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LEADER: You can’t run from Dothraki. You know this.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: I will never run from Dothraki.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LEADER (to LHAZAREEN WOMAN): Go, show her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The Lhazareen woman takes DAENERYS outside the temple. They walk together.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: I needed fresh air. The old women stink.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: They do stink.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: You must have been very young when your Khal died.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Sixteen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: Too bad he didn’t die sooner.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS and the Lhazareen woman smile at each other.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Yes, too bad.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The pair round a bend to a secluded desert outcropping.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Is it true you have three dragons?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: Mm-hmm.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: And they breathe fire?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: They do. Would you like to see them one day?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LHAZAREEN WOMAN: I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO grabs the Lhazareen woman from behind, covers her mouth, and places his dagger against her neck. JORAH is standing behind DAARIO.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: No, don’t hurt her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAARIO: She’ll give us away.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: We have to go now.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS grabs DAARIO’s dagger-carrying hand, and he drops it away from the Lhazareen woman’s neck.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JORAH: All we can do is try.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: No. We can do more than that. And you’re going to help me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS looks at the Lhazareen woman.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi. Do not betray me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The Lhazareen woman nods. DAENERYS looks at DAARIO. DAARIO slowly removes his hand from her mouth.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY is sitting in the corner of her cell. SEPTA UNELLA enters, then guides MARGAERY out into the prayer room where the HIGH SPARROW waits. MARGAERY walks into the room and shields her eyes from the sunlight. SEPTA UNELLA pushes MARGAERY to her knees, then exits.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power. Seeking out your family means seeking out sin. I’m not maligning you. I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else. My father was a cobbler. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: Quality takes time.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: Yes. I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger, verse 25.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: You know The Seven-Pointed Star.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people. You’re close. But it wasn’t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: So what did you do?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: I left to go and find them. I didn’t even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The HIGH SPARROW stands and extends his hand out to MARGAERY.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: Come, let’s go and see him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: Who?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	HIGH SPARROW: Your brother.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY enters her brother’s cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: Loras. Loras.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LORAS: I can’t stay strong. I never was strong.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LORAS: I don’t care about that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don’t care?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LORAS: I just want it to stop. Help me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That’s why he’s letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LORAS: Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LORAS begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MARGAERY: All right.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI is walking down the hall to TOMMEN’s chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAESTER PYCELLE: And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that’s the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI enters the room
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: What are you doing here?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAESTER PYCELLE: I am advising the king on our current predicament.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEi: Leave.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAESTER PYCELL: I am a member of the Small Council. The king’s small --
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: Is this a Small Council meeting?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAESTER PYCELL: Obviously not. I’m here to lend my wisdom and my support.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TOMMEN: Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAESTER PYCELL: Your Grace.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAESTER PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TOMMEN: I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: As have we all, unfortunately.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TOMMEN: We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can’t put her at risk. He’s dangerous.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI takes TOMMEN by the chin.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TOMMEN looks down.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: It’s all right. It's done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TOMMEN: You don’t like Margaery, do you?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TOMMEN: Mother...there’s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: You’ve spoken with him?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TOMMEN: I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone. If he found out I told --
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KEVAN and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KEVIN and LADY OLENNA stand up.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LADY OLENNA: I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You’re not welcome.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LADY OLENNA: My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JAIME: Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LADY OLENNA: Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEi: I agree.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JAIME (to KEVAN): You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KEVAN:  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JAIME:  You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KEVAN: No, but if the king should call on me --
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JAIME:  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KEVAN: Of course I want him back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CERSEI: Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KEVAN: If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We’ll have civil war. Many will die.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	LADY OLENNA: Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	CUT TO: PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON enters. YARA is sitting by the fire.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: They told me you were home and I didn’t believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He’s dead. He’s been dead a long time." He let you go?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: I escaped.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA turns and looks at THEON.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: I can’t hear you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: I escaped.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA stands up and then walks towards THEON.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: I’m sorry.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: You were my brother. You’re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: I know. I know and I’m sorry.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: Stop saying that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: I know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: You don’t know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: He send us one of those pieces. That’s why I came for you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON sobs.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: Why did you come here?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: Where else could I go?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: I didn’t know.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: I don’t want to be king.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: What do you want?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: I should’ve listened to you. You’re the only one --
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	YARA: That doesn’t matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me. Tell me what you want.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	THEON: You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	INT. WINTERFELL – ROOM
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA: A lord?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: Yes. A lord. You’ve seen my banners?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA: The flayed man.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: Does that worry you at all?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA: You eat them after?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: No.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA: Then I’ve seen worse.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife.  RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: You served the Starks?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA: Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I’ve served them.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA:  He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn’t get no wages. Way I see it, I’m owed.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He’s mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA: I can give you what you want.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: Are you sure you know what that is?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA: Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA slowly begins to reach for the knife on the table.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: You’re a good talker.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY grabs OSHA by her hair and yanks her head back.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: I like that.

s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	OSHA's hand inches closer to the knife.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	RAMSAY: He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it.

s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DOLOROUS EDD (to SANSA): Sorry about the food. It’s not what we’re known for.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: That’s all right. There are more important things.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	A Night's Watchman enters the room and holds out a scroll to JON SNOW.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	MAN: A letter for you, Lord Commander.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: I’m not Lord Commander anymore.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: "To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW looks at SANSA.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Go on.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: It's just more of the same.

s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: "You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW: We don’t know that.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: Yes, we do.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TORMUND: How many men does he have in his army?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis’s attack.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	JON SNOW (to TORMUND): How many do you have?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	TORMUND: That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA (to JON SNOW): You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They’ll fight for you if you ask.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA takes JON SNOW's hand.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	SANSA: A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.

s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #1: So we don’t spill blood.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: Well… there’s always a little blood.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #1: Someone crushed his head with a rock.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.

s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #2: Who cares about her? She’s a midget.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #1: I like her.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #2: She’s paler than milk.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #3: I’d like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #1: Good. You can suck my dick.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The Khals laugh.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL #4: The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They’re offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I’ll take their horses for myself.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: Don’t you want to know what I think?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	All the khals raise their heads and stare at DAENERYS
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: You’d rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you’d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: No. I don’t want either of those things.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: We don’t care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: And you were dumb enough to believe him?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	The khals laugh.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we’ll take turns fucking you. And then we’ll let our bloodriders fuck you.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO stands.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	KHAL MORO: And If there’s anything left of you, we’ll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS lays her hand on a fire pit.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS: You’re not going to serve. You’re going to die.
s06e04	Book of the Stranger	DAENERYS knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple.

s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Yes?
s06e05	The Door	A man of the Night’s Watch enters.
s06e05	The Door	MAN: For you, my lady.

s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER is standing in the center of the room. SANSA and BRIENNE enter. LITTLEFINGER turns to greet them.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Unharmed? What are you doing here?
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn’t know, you’re an idiot. If you did know, you’re my enemy.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA steps closer to LITTLEFINGER.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark’s daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: I can’t begin to contemplate --
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: What do you think he did to me?
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE: Lady Sansa asked you a question.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: He beat you.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I --
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: What else?
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: Did he cut you?
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: I didn’t know.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: I thought you knew everyone’s secrets.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: I’m so sorry.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: You said you would protect me.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: I don’t believe you anymore. I don’t need you anymore. You can’t protect me. You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn’t I?
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: What if I want you to die here and now?
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: Then I will die.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: I have an army.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: Your brother’s army.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER walks beside SANSA.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER: Half-brother.
s06e05	The Door	LITTLEFINGER exits.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA and the WAIF are dueling with staves atop the sparring platform. They both strike many blows, all of them deflected by the other. The WAIF feigns and trips ARYA with a blow to the back of the legs. ARYA falls to the ground. The WAIF points her staff in ARYA’s face.
s06e05	The Door	WAIF: You’re not ready. You should go home before it’s too late.
s06e05	The Door	The WAIF begins to walk away. ARYA jumps to her feet. The WAIF turns around and drops her staff, then approaches ARYA. ARYA swings at the WAIF several times, but the WAIF dodges and redirects the blows. The WAIF kicks ARYA in her midsection, sending her off the platform. ARYA hops back on the platform and advances. The WAIF disarms ARYA and punches her multiple times, knocking her off the platform and onto the ground.
s06e05	The Door	WAIF: You’ll never be one of us, Lady Stark.

s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: She has a point.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN walks away. ARYA follows. They enter the Hall of Faces.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: Who was the first?
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: Where did they go?
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: A girl has no desires.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN holds up a small bottle.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: Who?
s06e05	The Door	ARYA takes the bottle.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE
s06e05	The Door	Actors are performing a play. An audience has gathered to watch. ARYA is among them. On stage, an actor named IZEMBARO dressed as ROBERT BARATHEON walks back and forth. Two prop men mirror his movements, carrying a tarp that displays a forest landscape. Another prop man carries a cut-out of a boar and rams it into the actor’s rear end. The sound man makes a farting noise.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO: Ahh!
s06e05	The Door	ARYA laughs along with the crowd. The prop man strikes IZEMBARO with the boar prop again, this time in front. The actor recoils and the prop men replace the forest background with a black background.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO: Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO produces an intestine prop from his garb. He staggers, but is supported by another actor, CLARENZO, portraying JOFFREY.
s06e05	The Door	CLARENZO: Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don’t die.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO prop slaps CLARENZO. ARYA laughs with the crowd.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO: Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.
s06e05	The Door	The actor portraying Joffrey falls to his knees in the front of the stage. LADY CRANE, portraying CERSEI, appears on the stage and walks to him.
s06e05	The Door	LADYC RANE: I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO: Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO, portraying TYRION, appears and fills his glass. CAMELLO, portraying NED, appears and adjusts his crotch.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO: He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you’re the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO gestures to IZEMBARO.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.
s06e05	The Door	The crowd laughs. ARYA looks around at them. She does not laugh.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO: I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go.
s06e05	The Door	The sound man makes a farting noise.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: The Iron Throne’s what I demand.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: You cannot.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: I can.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: You will not.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: I will.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: You dare not.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: I dare yes.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: The line of succession.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: What’s that mean?
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: The proper progression.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: What’s that mean?
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: The lawful ascension.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: What’s that mean?
s06e05	The Door	The crowd laughs. Music plays. The crowd claps and cheers. The actors change scenes. CLARENZO is sitting on a cut-out of the Iron Throne. LADY CRANE and CAMELLO are standing next to him. BOBONO stands off to the side on a step stool.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: So move along, give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble.
s06e05	The Door	CLARENZO prop slaps CAMELLO. CAMELLO stumbles into the grasp of BOBONO, who sends him to his knees.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: But we had a deal all done and dusted.
s06e05	The Door	Two prop men carrying spears lift CAMELLO to his feet.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted.
s06e05	The Door	The prop men usher CAMELLO offstage. As they change the scene, CLARENZO and LADY CRANE take center stage. LADY CRANE dons CLARENZO with a crown. In a new scene, CAMELLO is on a cut-out chopping block. CLARENZO and LADY CRANE stand to one side, and a prop man dressed as an executioner stands on the other. BIANCA, portraying Sansa, appears.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA: Save my father.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA: Save him, please.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
s06e05	The Door	CLARENZO: Good people, you may all relax. My father’s friend shall be spared the —
s06e05	The Door	The prop man portraying the executioner swings his axe. CAMELLO ducks behind the chopping block and tosses out a prop head.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA: Father! No! Oh, father.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA takes the prop head. The executioner prop man wrenches the head from her grasp and tosses it to the other prop men.
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO: Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position’s mine for life. And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife.
s06e05	The Door	He prop slaps CLARENZO in the face.
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO: You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
s06e05	The Door	He rips open her shirt, exposing her breasts.
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO: So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: BACKSTAGE
s06e05	The Door	All the actors from the play are gathered together, taking a break and attending to their costumes. The director, IZEMBARO, joins them. CLARENZO is examining his penis.

s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: Well, don’t worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO approaches ARYA and tosses her his costume cloak.
s06e05	The Door	CAMELLO: Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO (to BIANCA): You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA: I had two lines.
s06e05	The Door	IZEMBARO: There are no small parts. You rang very false.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA: I rang very false?
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO: What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA slaps BOBONO upside the head.
s06e05	The Door	BIANCA (to IZEMBARO): You weren’t complaining about me last night.
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO approaches LADY CRANE.
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO: May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: I’m a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we’re going to be intimate.
s06e05	The Door	BOBONO: Of course we’re going to be intimate.
s06e05	The Door	LADY CRANE: It’s only a matter of time.

s06e05	The Door	JAQEN looks at ARYA and nods.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: A girl is not ready.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: She’s a good actress.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: So a man has heard.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: Seems like a decent woman.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: No. Who wants her dead?
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: That does not matter. The price was paid.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
s06e05	The Door	ARYA: A girl has decided.
s06e05	The Door	JAQEN: A servant does not ask questions.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN is clinging to the roots of the tree. His eyes are glazed white.

s06e05	The Door	BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are walking together. They approach a weirwood tree encircled by many stones. The stones form a spiral. A Child of the Forest runs between the stones. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN follow her. They find a group of the Children crouching in a circle, whispering to each other. LEAF stands, carrying a shard of dragonglass. She approaches a man who is bound to the weirwood tree.
s06e05	The Door	MAN: No! No! No!
s06e05	The Door	LEAF slowly drives the shard into the man’s heart until it disappears inside his chest. The man’s eyes turn blue.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE
s06e05	The Door	LEAF is watching BRAN. BRAN releases the root of the tree and wakes up from his vision.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: It was you. You made the White Walkers.
s06e05	The Door	LEAF: We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: From whom?
s06e05	The Door	LEAF: From you. From men.
s06e05	The Door	LEAF exits. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN stare at each other.
s06e05	The Door	All the Ironborn are gathered together. YARA, THEON, and AERON stand among them.
s06e05	The Door	AERON: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
s06e05	The Door	YARA walks out into the open.
s06e05	The Door	YARA: I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne.
s06e05	The Door	MAN #1: We’ve never had a queen. Not once.
s06e05	The Door	YARA: There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.
s06e05	The Door	ALL: Aye!
s06e05	The Door	YARA: We are a sea people.
s06e05	The Door	ALL: Aye!
s06e05	The Door	YARA: Our god is a sea god.
s06e05	The Door	ALL: Aye!
s06e05	The Door	YARA: When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —
s06e05	The Door	MAN #2: You shall not be queen!
s06e05	The Door	YARA: I am not finished!
s06e05	The Door	MAN #2: Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon’s own male heir has returned.
s06e05	The Door	The man looks at THEON. THEON emerges from the crowd and turns to face them.
s06e05	The Door	THEON: I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
s06e05	The Door	THEON points at YARA.
s06e05	The Door	THEON: And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is.
s06e05	The Door	ALL: Aye!
s06e05	The Door	THEON: She is a reaver!
s06e05	The Door	ALL: Aye!
s06e05	The Door	THEON: She is a warrior!
s06e05	The Door	ALL: Aye!
s06e05	The Door	THEON: She is ironborn!
s06e05	The Door	ALL: Aye!
s06e05	The Door	THEON: We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
s06e05	The Door	THEON and YARA stare at each other. The men cheer and chant YARA’s name.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: I’m Euron Greyjoy.
s06e05	The Door	The men fall silent. EURON appears and walks through the crowd towards YARA and THEON.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: I claim the Salt Throne.
s06e05	The Door	EURON emerges from the crowd and stands before YARA and THEON. He looks at YARA.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Niece.
s06e05	The Door	EURON looks at THEON and then walks up to him.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Nephew. Little Theon.
s06e05	The Door	EURON pats THEON on the cheek, then turns to face the crowd.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
s06e05	The Door	The Ironborn laugh. EURON points at YARA.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Explains why you think a woman can be king.
s06e05	The Door	YARA: When did you return, Uncle?
s06e05	The Door	EURON: A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
s06e05	The Door	YARA: I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
s06e05	The Door	The men murmur to each other.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
s06e05	The Door	THEON: That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
s06e05	The Door	The Ironborn laugh.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
s06e05	The Door	THEON: You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: And how will she do that?
s06e05	The Door	YARA: I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.
s06e05	The Door	The Ironborn laugh.
s06e05	The Door	YARA: You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
s06e05	The Door	EURON: I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
s06e05	The Door	The Ironborn cheer and chant EURON’s name. THEON and YARA exchange a glance.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: PYKE - BEACH
s06e05	The Door	Several Ironborn carrying flags stand on the shore. EURON is kneeling in the water. AERON pushes him underwater. Meanwhile, YARA, THEON, and some Ironborn run through a cave tunnel.
s06e05	The Door	AERON: May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.
s06e05	The Door	THEON, YARA, and the men with them run out onto a beach and into awaiting rowboats.
s06e05	The Door	AERSON: Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
s06e05	The Door	EURON drowns.
s06e05	The Door	AERON: Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
s06e05	The Door	YARA, THEON, and the men board a large ship.
s06e05	The Door	AERON: What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.
s06e05	The Door	AERON releases his grip on EURON. Two Ironborn carrying EURON onto shore. AERON and the other Ironborn gathered in attendance all stare at EURON. EURON does not move.One man begins to walk closer to him. EURON gags and coughs. He props himself up on his arms and legs, then spits up water and gasps for air. AERON retrieves a crown made of driftwood and places it on EURON’s head.
s06e05	The Door	AERON: What is dead may never die.
s06e05	The Door	ALL: What is dead may never die.
s06e05	The Door	The Ironborn cheer. EURON rises to his feet and looks around at the crowd.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them.
s06e05	The Door	EURON leads AERON and the Ironborn up to a seaside cliff. They stare out at the ocean. A fleet of ships is sailing away from Pyke.
s06e05	The Door	AERON: They stole our best ships.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Won’t be enough to save them.
s06e05	The Door	EURON turns to face the Ironborn.
s06e05	The Door	EURON: Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS stands at the edge of the cliff, looking out at Vaes Dothrak. She turns to face JORAH and DAARIO, who are standing behind her.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS (to JORAH): I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS approaches JORAH, but he recoils.
s06e05	The Door	JORAH: You must send me away.
s06e05	The Door	JORAH rolls up his sleeve to reveal the greyscale covering his forearm.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS: Is there a cure?
s06e05	The Door	JORAH: I don’t know.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS: How long does it take?
s06e05	The Door	JORAH: I don’t know that either. But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I’ll end things before that.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS begins to cry.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
s06e05	The Door	JORAH: Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi.
s06e05	The Door	JORAH begins to walk away.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS: Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal.
s06e05	The Door	JORAH turns back to face DAENERYS. She approaches him.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS: You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
s06e05	The Door	JORAH nods.
s06e05	The Door	DAENERYS: Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE
s06e05	The Door	JORAH sits on a horse, watching DAENERYS and DAARIO lead the Dothraki horde out of Vaes Dothrak. He turns his horse around and starts off into the wilderness.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are gathered together. TYRION pours himself a glass of wine and joins them.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?
s06e05	The Door	GREY WORM: None.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
s06e05	The Door	GREY WORM: Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
s06e05	The Door	GREY WORM: For now.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: For now is the best we get in our profession.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: It’s not enough.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.
s06e05	The Door	MISSANDEI: The people know who brought them freedom.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: Who said anything about “him”?
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER
s06e05	The Door	TYRION and VARYS stand on the plateau above the audience chamber. A woman stans  at the bottom of the steps, and a man stand a few steps in front of her.
s06e05	The Door	MAN (speaking Valyrian): You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light.
s06e05	The Door	The man steps aside. KINVARA walks up a few steps.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION (speaking Valyrian): Welcome to Meereen.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA stops on the middle plateau.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: That’s about the extent of my Valyrian.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA says nothing.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION looks at VARYS. KINVARA says nothing.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA continues up the steps.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: Yes.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: She did indeed.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: I’d settle for obeyed.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: That sounds most excellent --
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS: And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?
s06e05	The Door	TYRION: My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.
s06e05	The Door	VARYS nods. KINVARA takes two more steps. She is one step away from TYRION and VARYS.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA approaches VARYS and places her hand on his arm.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
s06e05	The Door	VARYS scrunches up his face and stares at KINVARA. KINVARA smiles.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA: We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.
s06e05	The Door	KINVARA turns and walks back down the steps.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN lets a handful of sand run through his fingers. He lays back and then looks SUMMER, HODOR, and the THREE-EYED RAVEN. SUMMER and HODOR are sleeping, but the THREE-EYED RAVEN has his eyes open. BRAN picks up a wood chip and throws it at the THREE-EYED RAVEN. The THREE-EYED RAVEN does not stir. BRAN drags himself over to the roots of the tree and takes hold of them. His eyes turn white.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND
s06e05	The Door	BRAN walks among the spiraling stones surrounding the weirwood tree from before, only now everything is covered in snow. He stares at the tree, then turns around. The army of the undead stands in attendance.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: What?
s06e05	The Door	BRAN walks towards them, and then among their ranks. They do not react. He inspects several of them as he walks by. On the other side of the army, he finds the Night King and four White Walkers on horseback. The Night King stares at him. BRAN turns around to find the entire army of the undead staring at him. When he turns back around, the Night King is standing right behind him. He recoils, but the Night King grabs his forearm. He screams.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE
s06e05	The Door	BRAN screams as he releases the tree root and the vision ends. MEERA jumps to her feet.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.
s06e05	The Door	LEAF and another Child of the Forest enter.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: I don’t know. He was close, but --
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN pulls back his sleeve. There is a handprint on his forearm.
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: But he can’t get in.
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: The time for what?
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: For you to become me.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN: But am I ready?
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: No.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN’s eyes turn white.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW, SANSA, BRIENNE, DOLOROUS EDD, DAVOS, TORMUND, and MELISANDRE are gathered around a table. A map is spread out on the table with tokens indicating houses laid on its surface.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW: We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS stands and moves some of the tokens to Winterfell.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: Precious little, my lady.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW: There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: No, but I do.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW stares at SANSA.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW: How do you know that?
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
s06e05	The Door	DAVOS: That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA smiles.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE follows SANSA down the stairs and along a walkway.
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE: I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE: We can send the Blackfish a raven.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE and SANSA enter SANSA’s chamber. BRIENNE closes the door behind them.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA sits down on her bed.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: What is it?
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE: I don’t like leaving you here alone.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: With Jon?
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE: Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him.
s06e05	The Door	BRIENNE: Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD
s06e05	The Door	Several men of the Night’s Watch are readying horses. JON SNOW stands beside them. MELISANDRE sits on her horse behind them. BRIENNE walks past. SANSA approaches JON SNOW, carrying a bundled cloak.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW: New dress?
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: I made it myself. Do you like it?
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW: Year, it’s -- I like the wolf bit.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: Good, because I made this for you.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA hands JON SNOW the cloak. JON SNOW looks at it. The direwolf sigil of House Stark is pressed into the leather straps.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW: Thank you, Sansa.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA: You’re welcome.
s06e05	The Door	SANSA walks away. BRIENNE is sitting on horseback beside TORMUND. TORMUND stares at her. She catches him staring and looks away. He grins. DOLOROUS EDD approaches JON SNOW, who is donning his new cloak.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW: Don’t knock it down while I’m gone.
s06e05	The Door	DOLOROUS EDD: I’ll do my best.
s06e05	The Door	They embrace.
s06e05	The Door	DOLOROUS EDD: Good luck.
s06e05	The Door	JON SNOW walks to his horse and climbs atop it. He leads SANSA, MELISANDRE, PODRICK, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and the rest of the party out through the southern gates. A man of the Night’s Watch approaches DOLOROUS EDD, who is watching them leave.
s06e05	The Door	MAN: Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?
s06e05	The Door	DOLOROUS EDD: I’m not the Lord Comman --
s06e05	The Door	The men of the Night’s Watch gather around DOLOROUS EDD.
s06e05	The Door	DOLOROUS EDD: Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.
s06e05	The Door	BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are both having a vision. MEERA and HODOR are preparing for travel.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn’t a cave.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR chuckles.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Eat something that isn’t moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
s06e05	The Door	HODOR laughs.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA notices she can see her breath. She looks at BRAN and then runs to the entrance of the cave. LEAF and the other Children of the Forest are gathered outside. Across the field, the Night King, three White Walkers, and the army of the dead are gathered. The Night King steps forward, kneels, and places his hand on the ground. A rift cracks through the ice all across the field and into the Great Weirwood Tree.
s06e05	The Door	LEAF: Get Bran and run!
s06e05	The Door	MEERA runs back into the cave, retrieving a sword on the way back. The Night King unsheathes his blade and leads the White Walkers and the army of the dead towards the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA runs to BRAN and shakes him.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR sits in the corner, rocking back and forth.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Bran, wake up.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL
s06e05	The Door	BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN watch YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN embrace. BRAN smiles.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE
s06e05	The Door	MEERA hauls the sledge over to BRAN and tries to drag him onto it.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Help me!
s06e05	The Door	Outside, LEAF and the Children of the Forest throw magic spheres at the army of the undead. The spheres explode upon contact, killing some of the wights. With one of the last bombs, LEAF lights a half-circle of flame in front of the entrance to the cave. She and the Children of the Forest run inside. The Night King and the White Walkers approach the flame. The flame parts to let them pass, then reforms. The army of the dead cannot pass through the flame. They go around it and climb the crag to the top of the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA places BRAN on the sledge.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL
s06e05	The Door	BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN continue to watch.
s06e05	The Door	RICKARD (to YOUNG NED): Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.
s06e05	The Door	NAN walks over to YOUNG HODOR and takes his arm.
s06e05	The Door	YOUNG NED: Yes, Father.
s06e05	The Door	RICKARD takes YOUNG NED by the chin.
s06e05	The Door	RICKARD: But if you have to fight, win.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE
s06e05	The Door	MEERA continues shaking BRAN.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Bran! Bran, wake up!
s06e05	The Door	A wight falls through the ceiling. It advances on MEERA. MEERA grabs her sword and cuts it down. Another wight falls from the ceiling. MEERA recoils. SUMMER tackles it. MEERA drops her blade and returns to BRAN.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	LEAF enters and runs up to BRAN and MEERA. A third wight falls from the ceiling, suspended upside down by its feet. LEAF rushes over to it and beheads it with her knife.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: You have to wake up. We need Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	Another wight rushes, but LEAF shoots it with an arrow. A Child of the Forest enters to combat another wight, but the wight knocks her down and kills her. LEAF shoots it with an arrow.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	A number of wights begin piling in. LEAF and the Children of the Forest try to fight them off. One wight kills another Child of the Forest.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Bran, we’re all going to die!
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL
s06e05	The Door	BRAN hears MEERA shouting at him from the other side.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up! We’re all going to die! Bran! Bran!
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!
s06e05	The Door	HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Warg into Hodor now!
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL
s06e05	The Door	BRAN looks at YOUNG HODOR and NAN.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: Listen to your friend, Brandon.
s06e05	The Door	HODOR (V.O.): Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE
s06e05	The Door	HODOR’s eyes flash white. More wights enter the cave. One of them kills another Child of the Forest. MEERA cuts it down. Another Child of the Forest  jumps forward and stabs another wight with a spear. HODOR stands and walks over to BRAN.  A White Walker enters. The spear-bearing Child of the Forest lunges at it and stabs it in the chest, but the blow has no effect. The White Walker pushes the spear aside and stabs the Child of the Forest, killing her. HODOR lifts the sledge with BRAN atop it. MEERA grabs a dragonglass spear and launches it into the White Walker’s neck. The White Walker shatters and dies. MEERA and LEAF follow HODOR towards the back entrance. SUMMER growls and bares his teeth at the wights entering the cave.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Summer!
s06e05	The Door	LEAF: Go. Go!
s06e05	The Door	LEAF and MEERA run into the back tunnel. SUMMER attacks the wights. The wights encircle him and stab him to death. LEAF, MEERA, and HODOR hurry down the back tunnel. BRAN is still engaged in a vision on the sledge. A slew of wights pursues them. Back in the cave, the Night King enters and approaches the THREE-EYED RAVEN.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL
s06e05	The Door	THREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come. Leave me.
s06e05	The Door	Back in the Great Weirwood tree, the Night King slashes the THREE-EYED RAVEN. The THREE-EYED RAVEN dissolves into a black mist in front of BRAN.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - BACK TUNNEL
s06e05	The Door	The undead army is advancing. LEAF stops running.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: What are you doing?
s06e05	The Door	LEAF: Go!
s06e05	The Door	LEAF turns to face the undead. She brandishes a magic bomb and primes it. The wights overtake her and knock her to the ground, stabbing her repeatedly. LEAF detonates the bomb, killing herself and the wights surrounding her. HODOR reaches the rear door. He puts down the sledge and begins ramming the door. More wights appear and begin advancing.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Hodor, hurry!
s06e05	The Door	HODOR heaves the door open and drags the sledge outside. He drops the sledge and returns to the door, holding it closed. MEERA lifts the sledge and begins dragging it away.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Hold the door!
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL
s06e05	The Door	BRAN turns and stares at YOUNG HODOR, who stares back at him.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA (V.O.): Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
s06e05	The Door	YOUNG HODOR’s eyes turn white. He falls to the ground and convulses.
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - BACK ENTRANCE
s06e05	The Door	HODOR puts his weight against the door.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA: Hold the door!
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL
s06e05	The Door	YOUNG HODOR continues convulsing.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA (V.O.): Hold the door!
s06e05	The Door	NAN: Wylis! What’s the matter?
s06e05	The Door	NAN kneels down beside YOUNG HODOR. BRAN walks over to them.
s06e05	The Door	MEERA (V.O.): Hold the door!
s06e05	The Door	YOUNG HODOR: Hold the door!
s06e05	The Door	In the present day, HODOR struggles against the door.
s06e05	The Door	YOUNG HODOR: Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
s06e05	The Door	CUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - BACK ENTRANCE
s06e05	The Door	The wights begin to break through the door. They clutch HODOR’s clothing and begin tearing at his flesh.

s06e05	The Door	From HBO:
s06e05	The Door	Tyrion seeks a strange ally. Bran learns a great deal. Brienne goes on a mission. Arya is given a chance to prove herself.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	Heavy snow is falling. MEERA is dragging BRAN’s sledge through the forest. BRAN’s eyes are glazed white. He experiences many visions of the past all at once. MEERA staggers and falls against the base of a tree. She puts all her weight into pulling the sledge, but it does not budge. She begins crying and goes to BRAN, cradling his head. BRAN continues to have rapid fire visions, then sees a group of wights running through the woods. He wakes up from the visions and looks at MEERA.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN: Meera. They found us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MEERA looks out into the woods and sees the group of wights. She begins crying and embraces BRAN.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MEERA: I’m so sorry.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The wights converge on MEERA and BRAN. Moments before they reach them, a cloaked rider appears. The rider’s horse kicks one of the wights out of the way, then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge, and the rider hits them both with the chain, setting them on fire. A third wight tries to attack his horse, but the horse’s bulk rebuffs it into a tree and it crumbles. The rider plunges a chain-sickle into the chest of another wight, then rides forward, dragging the wight behind his horse. He sets another wight on fire with the chain, launching it into the air, and then approaches BRAN and MEERA.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RIDER: Come with me, now.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	A large group of wights approaches.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RIDER: The dead don’t rest.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The rider leans down and hoists BRAN up onto his horse. MEERA takes the rider’s hand and joins them on the horse’s back. The three of them ride off into the forest with wights in pursuit.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM, GILLY, and LITTLE SAMare riding in a carriage escorted by several soldiers. GILLY looks out the window. SAM is holding LITTLE SAM.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: It’s so green.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM looks away.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: That’s not any better being a nervous mute.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY looks at LITTLE SAM.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: That Little Sam is your baby.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: What did you tell your family about me?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: I told them I met you in the North.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: Did you tell them how far north?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY looks out the window.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: I think we’re here.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM looks out the window. The carriage is approaching the castle on Horn Hill.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: HORN HILL - COURTYARD
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	A party of guests is lined up at the entrance to the castle courtyard. GILLY and SAM enter. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. SAM’s mother, MELESS, and his sister, TALLA, descend a set of stairs and approach them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: Sam. Oh, Sam.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM and MELESSA embrace.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, hello, Mother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: I never thought I’d see you again. You look wonderful.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TALLA embraces SAM and he grunts.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Talla? Gods, you’re a woman now.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TALLA: Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: That’s enough, Talla.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY bows her head and curtsies.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: Oh, my. You are lovely.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA and TALLA smile at each other. MELESSA approaches the baby and smiles.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: Hello, little one. It’s me, your grandmother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LITTLE SAM smiles and touches MELESSA’s face.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: May I hold him?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: Yes, of course.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY passes LITTLE SAM to MELESSA.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA (to LITTLE SAM): You have a curious mind, I can tell. You’ll be a scholar like your father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Where is Father? And Dickon?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: They’re on a hunt. They’ll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA passes LITTLE SAM back to GILLY. SAM and MELESSA proceed up the steps. TALLA takes GILLY’s arm and they follow.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TALLA: Come, you’ll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What’s your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are standing in the central chamber. TOMMEN lights a candle.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: Is there no other way?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: You’re afraid for her?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY is sitting on a bench reading a book. The door opens. TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are visible outside. TOMMEN enters and stares at MARGAERY. The HIGH SPARROW closes the door behind TOMMEN. MARGAERY sets down her book and stands. They embrace.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: No, Your Grace.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: I’ve missed you. More than you could know.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: We’ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there’s no other way.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: Yes, a few times. Have you?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN scrunches up his face. MARGAERY chuckles and turns away.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: You think I’m mad. I sound mad.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: No. No, you don’t. You- - you could never. You’re right, he’s not. He’s a lot more- -
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: I don’t understand.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY rushes to TOMMEN and takes his hand.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY leads him to the bench and they sit down on it together.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: What about Loras?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MARGAERY: I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM paces. GILLY enters on the far end of the hall. She is wearing a dress and her hair is done up.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: It’s hard to walk in this.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY takes SAM’s arm and they walk down the hall together.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: HORN HILL - DINING HALL
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM, GILLY, MELESSA, TALLA, DICKON, and RANDYLL are sitting around the dinner table eating. RANDYLL takes a bite and stares at SAM. GILLY looks around at others using their utensils and mimics them. SAM looks at DICKON.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DICKON: Well, no. We haven’t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week’s.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DICKON: Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, that’s a fair distance.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DICKON: So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DICKON: Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it’s my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She’s- - she’s quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA (to GILLY): I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TALLA: Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: That’s enough of that.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: Samwell, would you care for more bread?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	A servant girl retrieves the basket of bread. She holds out the basket to SAM. SAM reaches for the bread.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: Not fat enough already?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM waves the servant away.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM puts down his utensils.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DICKON laughs.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DICKON: There’s no such thing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: The Night’s Watch came to our keep.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: Where?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Gilly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: North of the Wall.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL points to a blade mounted on a mantle beside the table.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA throws down her utensils and stands. She walks to GILLY.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: Come, my dear. Talla.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TALLA and GILLY stand and begin to follow MELESSA out of the hall.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: I’ve lost my appetite.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL: He dishonors us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MELESSA: You dishonor yourself.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RANDYLL (to SAM): Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY is sitting at the foot of the bed. LITTLE SAM is in a crib beside her. SAM stands before them both. He hangs his head.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: I’m not angry at you. I’m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: First light.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LITTLE SAM fusses and reaches for SAM. SAM takes his hand.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Say good-bye to him for me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM starts off but GILLY stands and gets in his way. She places her hands on his chest and kisses him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: You’re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn’t know what you are.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Good-bye, Gilly.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM walks to the door. He turns back and stares at GILLY before closing the doors. GILLY looks around the guest chamber and then goes to LITTLE SAM. She pulls his blanket up higher and comforts him. SAM bursts back into the room.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: Sam?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: We’re leaving.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: What?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Get your things.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: I don’t have any things.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM picks up LITTLE SAM.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: What are you doing?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: We belong together. All of us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM and GILLY walk briskly through the hall. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: What about your mother and sister?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: Oh, they’ll understand.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: Your sister’s dress.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM grabs a stool and carries it in front of the mantle hosting Heartsbane.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: She won’t mind. Looks better on you anyway.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM climbs on top of the stool.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: Sam. That’s your father’s sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM lifts Heartsbane off the mantle. He groans and slides it into its scabbard.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: It’s my family’s sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	GILLY: Sam. Won’t he come for it?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM: He can bloody well try.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	SAM hops down off the stool.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The acting troupe is putting on a repeat performance of The Bloody Hand,  their play about the happenings of Westerosi royalty. AYRA is standing in the crowd in the front row. On stage is CLORENZO portraying JOFFREY, an actress portraying MARGAERY, BIANCA portraying SANSA, BOBONO portraying TYRION, and LADY CRANE portraying CERSEI. CLORENZO is at center stage, brandishing a prop sword.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARENZO: The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The actress portraying MARGAERY runs to CLARENZO.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARENZO: And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ALL: Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARENZO: I’ll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO approaches CLARENZO and hands him a prop cup.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO: Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARNEZO takes the prop cup and BOBONO walks to center stage, addressing the audience.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO: The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO laughs and the audience boos. CLARENZO takes a sip from the prop cup, then gags and sputters. The audience gasps. He moves to center stage.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARENZO: Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA smiles and laughs in the crowd.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARENZO: I limp. And it was he…
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARENZO points at BOBONO. BOBONO holds up a prop vial of poison. The audience gasps and boos.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CLARENZO: ...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO laughs and exits with BIANCA. The audience boos. CLARENZO collapses and LADY CRANE kneels down beside him. ARYA laughs. LADY CRANE cradles the head of the actor portraying JOFFREY.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA’s smile fades.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA notices BIANCA standing offstage. BIANCA is watching LADY CRANE’s performance and mouths her lines as she utters them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE kisses CLARENZO’s cheek and lays his head down. The audience claps. The actors clear out the stage and the prop men change the scene. BOBONO enters carrying a prop crossbow. IZEMBARO, portraying TYWIN, is sitting on a prop toilet.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO: What is that I hear and smell? Someone I’ll soon send to hell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA leaves the front row and moves through the crowd.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO: It’s time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO pretends to shoot IZEMBARO with the crossbow. IZEMBARO cries out.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you’ve taken your father’s life.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA enters and walks further inward. On her way through the entrance hall, she sees the prop head the performers use for NED’s execution scene.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO (O.S.): No worse child ever stained this land.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: Curse the day I named you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO groans as though dying and turns to the side. The sound guy makes a farting noise.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO: My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA walks into the actor’s break room.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO (O.S.): Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA draws the curtain and stares at LADY CRANE’s bottle of rum.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO (O.S.): Don’t fear the winter.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO: Fear me!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO shoots a prop arrow into the audience and laughs. The audience gasps and boos him offstage.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO (O.S.): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA retrieves a vial of from her satchel. She uncorks LADY CRANE’s bottle of rum.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO, BIANCA, and CLARENZO stand center stage.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: I give you Bobono.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BOBONO enters the stage and the audience boos.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: I give you Camello.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA pours the contents of the vial into LADY CRANE’s rum bottle and corks it.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO (O.S.): And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	On stage, LADY CRANE enters and bows. The crowd cheers wildly. AYRA hears the cheering. She tucks the away the vial, draws back the curtain, and exits the break room. The actors are all piling into the area. CAMELLO approaches ARYA in the entrance hallway and hands her his costume cloak.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CAMELLO: Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That’s a dear.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO and BIANCA enter.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO (to BIANCA): That crowd was shit.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA walks past them and puts down the cloak. She moves to leave. LADY CRANE enters and sees her.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: Girl.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA stops on the steps and looks at LADY CRANE.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: What are you doing back here?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: Nothing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: Three times.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: Did you pay?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA smiles.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: No.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA walks off the steps to get out of the way of the prop men.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: I remember when the players came to my village. I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: You’re very good.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: My final speech is shit.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE takes ARYA by the waist and ushers her towards the break room.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	They stop in a side corridor.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: How would you change it?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: What’s your name?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: Mercy.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA smiles.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: I have to go. My father’s waiting for me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA exits. LADY CRANE enter the break room. BIANCA takes off her wig and notices LADY CRANE.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BIANCA: Lady Crane, they loved you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE removes her wig.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: No laugh for Ned’s death. These people are worse than animals.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO sips from a mug and gestures to LADY CRANE.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: But they loved her. They all love her.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CAMELLO removes his wig and approaches LADY CRANE.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CAMELLO: Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: I do what I can with what I’m given.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: With what you’re given?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: Well, I was thinking- -
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: Oh, we’re all thinkers now, are we?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO stands, slaps his chest, and walks closer to LADY CRANE.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: Full to the tits with ideas.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE: I didn’t mean- -
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I’m doing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO removes his wig.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	IZEMBARO: You have no right to an opinion.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LADY CRANE brings a glass of rum to her lips. Just before she drinks, ARYA appears and slaps the glass out of her hands. Everyone in the room stares at ARYA. ARYA points at BIANCA.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA: Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA exits. The WAIF is revealed to have been watching.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - OUTSIDE
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA pulls the stones away from where she hid Needle. She pulls Needle from inside the rocks and stares at it.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAQEN is cutting the face of a corpse. The WAIF enters.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAQEN: And?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WAIF: As I expected.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAQEN: A shame. A girl had many gifts.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAQEN begins lifting the face off of the corpse.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WAIF: You promised me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAQEN: Don’t let her suffer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The WAIF nods and exits. JAQEN pulls the face from the corpse.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: UNKNOWN ALLEY
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	ARYA sets down a lit candle and brandishes Needle. She places Needle on the ground, sits down beside it, and blows out the candle.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME is wearing armor and sitting atop a horse. He watches as MACE TYRELL, also wearing armor, leads a force of many soldiers down the street. MACE stops in front of JAIME and the soldiers halt.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MACE: My lord.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: My lord.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MACE turns his horse to face the soldiers.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MACE: My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MACE turns his horse back the other way and nods at JAIME. JAIME nods back.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CAPTAIN: Forward, march!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The HIGH SPARROW is standing on the steps beside MARGAERY and SEPTA UNELLA.. They are surrounded by Faith Militant, including LANCEL. The HIGH SPARROW is addressing a large gathering of commoners who stand at the foot of the steps.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The crowd murmurs and parts. JAIME and MACE enter, leading the soldiers. MARGAERY gasps to herself. On the side, a smaller group of soldiers sets down a carriage. OLENNA steps out of the carriage.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CAPTAIN: Company, halt! Face front! Turn!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The soldiers form up and turn to face the steps.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: Lord Tyrell.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MACE nods at the HIGH SPARROW.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: Ser Jaime.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: Sorry to interrupt. We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we’ll be on our way.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: I don’t have the authority to give them to you. And you don’t have the authority to take them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The crowd murmurs. JAIME ushers his horse forward and rides it up the steps. He halts in front of the Faith Militant.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CAPTAIN: Lock spears!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The soldiers grunt and point their spears towards the Faith Militant.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: The gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The crowd murmurs. OLENNA motions to MACE with her fan. MACE motions to one of the high ranking soldiers, who nods to the Captain.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CAPTAIN: Order up!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The soldiers return to a relaxed position.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The doors to the Great Sept of Baelor open. TOMMEN emerges, accompanied by the Kingsguard. The crowd murmurs. JAIME looks back at OLENNA, who looks down. TOMMEN and the Kingsguard walk down the steps until TOMMEN stands beside MARGAERY. TOMMEN takes MARGAERY’s hand.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	HIGH SPARROW: Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The crowd cheers.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WOMAN: Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN looks at JAIME. JAIME shakes his head. TOMMEN looks at the crowd.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The crowd cheers.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MACE (to OLENNA): What’s happening?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	OLENNA: He’s beaten us. That’s what’s happening.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The HIGH SPARROW smiles at JAIME.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CUT TO: RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The room is lined with soldiers on either side. TOMMEN is sitting on the throne. KEVAN stands beside him. JAIME stands at the foot of the throne and removes his armor, letting it drop to the floor.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do anything.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: I have to answer to the gods.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: Not when you’re sitting in that chair.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: The Crown’s decision on this matter is final.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN and KEVAN look at each other.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	TOMMEN: You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER FREY is sitting in a high chair addressing two of his sons, BLACK WALDER and LOTHAR. One of his young daughter stands beside him. Many other family members sit at the tables, eating.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: You’ve lost it?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BLACK WALDER: Yes, father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LOTHAR: He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BLACK WALDER: I don’t think it’s fair to blame us- -
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BLACK WALDER: We don’t have the men.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BLACK WALDER: The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LOTHAR: The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BLACK WALDER: Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER slaps his daughter on on the buttocks.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: If I want excuses, I’ll put her in charge. They’re laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King’s Landing, they’re laughing at us.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER stands. Many family members stare at him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	LOTHAR: He’ll never yield, Father.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: Oh, he’ll yield.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER nods at some servants at the rear of the hall. LOTHAR looks back at the servants. The servants exit. WALDER points first at LOTHAR and then at BLACK WALDER.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat. And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER pulls his daughter into his lap. The servants return, ushering in a man bound in chains. They undo his chains. The man is EDMURE TULLY. EDMURE stares at WALDER.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	WALDER: Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You’re going home.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME and CERSEI are sitting in chairs across the room from each other.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME stands and paces.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI: BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: I’m not going to the Riverlands.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME pours himself a cup of wine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI: What, then?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI: You can’t.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI: We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME: You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI: It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI stands and approaches JAIME.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI: They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	JAIME and CERSEI embrace and kiss. CERSEI whispers into JAIME’s ear.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	CERSEI: We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	They resume kissing.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MEERA, BRAN, and the rider are gathered around a campfire. The rider beheads a rabbit and begins draining its blood. MEERA watches him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MEERA: Why did you help us?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The rider looks at MEERA from behind his face mask.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RIDER: The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	MEERA: The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RIDER: Now he lives again.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN startles as he comes out of a vision. MEERA goes to him.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	RIDER (to BRAN): When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN: Who are you?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The rider removes his hood and face mask. He is BENJEN STARK. His skin is gray and he has blemishes on his face.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN: Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN: I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN: How?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN: The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN: Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN: You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN: I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN stands and walks over to BRAN and MEERA.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN: You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN kneels beside BRAN and offers him a cup.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN: Drink.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BRAN takes the cup and drinks.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	BENJEN: One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS and DAARIO are leading the Dothraki horde on horseback. DAARIO shouts in Dothraki and raises his hand, halting the horde. DAENERYS stares at the face of a mountain crag in the distance.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO: Everything all right?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: How many days’ ride to Meereen?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO: A week at best.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO: Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: And who has that many?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO: Nobody.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: Nobody yet.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO: So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: I take what is mine.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO: You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: What was I made for?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO: You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The wind howls. DAENERYS stares beyond the mountain crag
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: Wait here.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS rides away from the horde and around the bend. Time passes. The Dothraki are growing antsy.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO (speaking Dothraki): I’m going after her. Wait for me here.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAARIO starts off, but stops when a dragon’s roar erupts from the sky. The Dothraki look around. The shadow of a dragon appears on the mountainside. DROGON flies over the Dothraki horde with DAENERYS on its back. DROGON circles around and lands in front of the horde. He roars.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki):  Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The Dothraki cheer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The Dothraki cheer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The Dothraki cheer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The Dothraki cheer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: Are you with me?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	The Dothraki continue to cheer.
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DAENERYS: Now and always?
s06e06	Blood of My Blood	DROGON spreads his wings and roars.
s06e07	The Broken Man	Many men are performing various tasks pertaining to the construction of a church. Many women are preparing food.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: That’s it. Get it to the top.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN #2: Steady. Steady.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BROTHER RAY is standing beneath the framing, addressing two men who are hoisting up a log.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Up she goes.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY turns to another man and slaps him on the back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY walks a few paces away, grabs an ax, and lifts it up to a man standing on the church framing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Here you are, son.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The man standing on the framing takes the ax. RAY turns to see two men carrying a log into the opening beneath the framing. He waves them in.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Oh, gentlemen, please.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY walks out from beneath the framing and addresses more men carrying logs.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY. And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY hurries beneath one of the logs and laughs. He turns and looks up at the church framing, smiles, and nods. In a field a little ways off, more men are carrying larger logs towards the church framing. Four men carry each log. A man carrying one of these heavy logs by himself comes into view. He drops the log in front of the church framing and pants, then turns to look out over the landscape. The man is SANDOR CLEGANE, The Hound.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR repeatedly swings an ax into a horizontal log. Woods chips fly everywhere. RAY walks up behind SANDOR.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: Just one.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR sinks the ax into the log.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: He was a woman.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY laughs. SANDOR continues chopping. RAY walks away.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT
s06e07	The Broken Man	A man standing beneath the church framing rings a bell. All of  the men rush down off the church framing and father at the food stations. The women divvy out food. RAY pours a cup of water and walks among the people. They are all sitting down on the ground and eating. SANDOR is sitting on a rock away from everyone else, eating. RAY approaches him from behind and hands him the cup of water. SANDOR takes it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: I’m used to it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR drinks the entire cup of water.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY sits down next to SANDOR and points at SANDOR’s right knee.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going?
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR pauses and stares ahead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: Hate.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR continues eating.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: No, there’s a reason you’re still here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR smiles. RAY stands and walks a few paces away from SANDOR, then turns to face him.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: You’re in the wrong line of work.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR stops eating and stares up at RAY. RAY nods at him.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I’ve heard stories.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: They have.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY walks away. SANDOR stares out across the fields.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY is reading from the Book of the Seven. She is wearing a crown. The HIGH SPARROW enters.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: Your Grace. What are we reading today?
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: “Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: They are hard to love.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The HIGH SPARROW sits down on a bench.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The HIGH SPARROW sighs.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: Can I ask you about a personal matter?
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Of course.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY sits on the bench beside the HIGH SPARROW.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: No.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The HIGH SPARROW stands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: My grandmother?
s06e07	The Broken Man	HIGH SPARROW: Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY and OLENNA are sitting at a table. SEPTA UNELLA stands several feet away, watching them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA stands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: Oh, this is madness!
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA takes MARGAERY’s hand and leads her out onto the balcony to a different table. SEPTA UNELLA follows them out. MARGAERY sits at the table.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA (to SEPTA UNELLA): You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Grandmother.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Grandmother, please.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA sits across from MARGAERY.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: What have they done to you?
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: We marched for you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title...
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: Have you lost your mind?
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: ...and live his life as a penitent.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: He can begin again.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: As a mindless fanatic.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: As a free man.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY stands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY walks around the table and kneels before OLENNA. Her back is to SEPTA UNELLA.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: I will never leave you. Never.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: You must.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY slips a piece of paper into OLENNA’s hand. MARGAERY’s eyes widen.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY stands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: The Mother watches over us all.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA stands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: I’ll see you soon, my dear.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY and OLENNA embrace. MARGAERY closes her eyes and then steps back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA nods and walks back into her chamber. MARGAERY stifles tears. She regains her composure and turns to face SEPTA UNELLA.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MARGAERY: Shall we pray?
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA walks out onto the balcony and shuts the door behind her. She looks around and then unfolds the piece of paper MARGAERY placed in her hand and looks at it. There is a drawing of a rose on it. OLENNA looks up and smiles.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW, SANSA, DAVOS, TORMUND, and WUN WUN are meeting with DIM DALBA and the other Wildling leaders. They are all gathered around a fire pit.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DIM DALBA: We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find.
s06e07	The Broken Man	TORMUND: If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DIM DALBA: Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive.
s06e07	The Broken Man	TORMUND gestures to JON SNOW.
s06e07	The Broken Man	TORMUND: The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.
s06e07	The Broken Man	WUN WUN stands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	WUN WUN: Snow.
s06e07	The Broken Man	WUN WUN walks away. DIM DALBA looks at the men around him. One of them nods. DIM DALBA walks up to JON SNOW and holds out his hand. JON takes it. DIM DALBA returns to his men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW (to TORMUND): Are you sure they’ll come?
s06e07	The Broken Man	TORMUND: We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW exhales.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA is sitting at a table, writing. CERSEI enters with GREGOR in tow.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CERSEI: I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: That is hardly your concern.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CERSEI: Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CERSEI: You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: Good.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CERSEI: I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CERSEI: You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CERSEI: Never. I’ll never leave my son.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA: What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery.
s06e07	The Broken Man	OLENNA goes back to writing.
s06e07	The Broken Man	A Lannister army approaches Riverrun led by JAIME and BRONN. JAIME and BRONN stop their horses on a hill and look out at the encampment of Freys at the foot of Riverrun.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: Pick the pace up. Keep going.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN #2: Keep it moving!
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: Someone certainly does.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME looks at BRONN.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: Aye, knights don’t get paid.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: And you’ll get all three. A Lannister always- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN ushers his horse onwards.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME and BRONN lead a group of Lannister soldiers through the encampment. Some Frey men gather around and stare at them. LOTHAR is standing at the foot of Riverrun, shouting up at the castle walls. BLACK WALDER is behind him, standing on a makeshift hangman’s platform. EDMURE is also on the platform with a noose around his neck. JAIME and BRONN watch them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR: Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we’ll hang him.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN TULLY, the Blackfish, walks along Riverrun’s castle wall and comes to a stop in front of an arrowslit. He stares out at LOTHAR, BLACK WALDER, and EDMURE.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR: This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR looks back at BLACK WALDER. BLACK WALDER takes the noose off of EDMURE’s neck and draws a knife.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER: You think I won’t do it, old man?
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER holds the knife to EDMURE’s neck.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER: I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Go on, then. Cut his throat.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN walks away. LOTHAR looks at BLACK WALDER and shrugs. BLACK WALDER takes the knife away from EDMURE’s neck. Some Frey men take EDMURE away. JAIME, BRONN, and the Lannister army advance towards LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER, and stop in front of them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: Lothar, is it?
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR: Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER: Whoa, whoa.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The Frey men stop walking. BLACK WALDER approaches JAIME.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR: Walder.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR puts his hand out to stop BLACK WALDER, but BLACK WALDER pushes him away. BLACK WALDER walks up to JAIME.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER: Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME looks BLACK WALDER up and down.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER: I don’t give a rat’s- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME hits BLACK WALDER across the face with his gold hand. BLACK WALDER staggers back beside LOTHAR.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR: Apologies, Ser Jaime.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR: Do as he says.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BLACK WALDER: Those are our siege towers- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER walk away. BRONN walks up behind JAIME.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: A parley or a fight?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: He’s an old man.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRONN: You’ve got one hand. My money’s on the old boy.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA MORMONT sits at a high table flanked by a commander and a maester. JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS enter. Some guards close the doors behind them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Lady Mormont.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: Welcome to Bear Island.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW looks at SANSA.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA leans towards her maester. They whisper to each other. LYANNA turns back to face JON SNOW.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW and SANSA fall silent. DAVOS steps forward.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: I don’t know you, Ser…?
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA turns to her maester.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA settles back into her chair.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: Go on, Ser Davos.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: Is this true?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW nods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA’s maester leans over to whisper in her ear, but she waves him away.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA leans to her military commander and they whisper to each other.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: 62.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: 62?
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA: We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LYANNA smiles and nods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME is on horseback, galloping through the encampment. He is accompanied by a bannerman and a regiment of foot soldiers. When he reaches the bridge leading to Riverrun’s castle, he dismounts his horse and walks across it. He stands at the foot of the bridge and stares down into the water. Above, several Tully soldiers notch their crossbows and point them at him through arrowslits. The drawbridge lowers. BRYNDEN stands on the other side, accompanied by a regiment of Tully soldiers. BRYNDEN walks out across the drawbridge alone and approaches JAIME.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Kingslayer.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: Blackfish.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: I don’t have them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME shakes his head.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Then why are you here?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: You know why I’m here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You’re trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Or you’ll kill Edmure?
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN walks past JAIME.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: My nephew’s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME positions himself beside BRYNDEN.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN turns to face JAIME and walks close to him.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN walks past JAIME and continues back across the drawbridge.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN turns back to face JAIME.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JAIME: Well, now you have.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN: Aye, now I have. I’m disappointed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	BRYNDEN turns around and walks back inside the castle. The drawbridge begins to close. JAIME scrunches up his face, turns around, and walks back across the bridge.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS are meeting with ROBETT GLOVER. Several men serving under ROBETT stand in attendance.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: The answer is no.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: House Mormont.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: And?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT laughs.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT turns around and heads up the stairs towards a door attended by his men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Lord Glover.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: There’s nothing else to say.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW glares at SANSA. ROBETT turns on his heel and walks up close to SANSA.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father’s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT gets closer to SANSA.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT looks at JON SNOW and then back at SANSA.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT: I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ROBETT turns, climbs the stairs to the door, and walks through it. SANSA and JON SNOW look down.
s06e07	The Broken Man	Many boats bearing the sigil of House Greyjoy on their sails are docked in the bay near the Long Bridge. Chatter and laughter can be heard from the Long Bridge.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR
s06e07	The Broken Man	Many Ironborn men are communing with prostitutes. THEON sits at a table alone, looking back at forth at them. YARA sits down at his table accompanied by a prostitute. She and the prostitute kiss at length. THEON does not look at them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON: Why did we have to come here?
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON: I don’t want one.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA sighs and turns back to the prostitute..
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Don’t go far, love.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA kisses the prostitutes breast.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: I’ll find you in a bit.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The prostitute stands. YARA kisses her backside and then slaps it. The prostitute giggles and runs away. YARA laughs and grabs a drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore?
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON scrunches up his face.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that?
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA pours herself another drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON: You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON: He’ll find us.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON: I don’t want any.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: I don’t care what you want. Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON takes a small sip of his drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Drink it all.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON drinks deeper.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON: Some bad years?
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON takes another deep drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON drinks more deeply..
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON: If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink.
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON downs the rest of his ale. YARA moves closer to THEON.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA places her hand on the back of THEON’s neck.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Are you with me? Are you really with me?
s06e07	The Broken Man	THEON slowly raises his head up and locks eyes with YARA. He nods. YARA smiles and kisses his forehead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA: Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one.
s06e07	The Broken Man	YARA stands, pats THEON on the back, walks over to the prostitute she was communing with earlier, and takes her hand. THEON stares blankly to the side.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS are riding horses through the encampment.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: And that’s a good thing?
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
s06e07	The Broken Man	They all dismount their horses and begin walking side by side.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: 2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: 62 Mormonts.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: It’s not what we’d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS spots two men fighting.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: For fuck’s sake.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS hurries over to the men. JON SNOW and SANSA watch him go and then continue walking.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head?
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA stops walking. JON keeps walking a few paces and then turns to face her.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: It’s not enough. We need more men.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: There’s no time.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA: If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW moves close to SANSA.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW: We fight with the army we have.
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW looks over SANSA’s shoulder at DAVOS. He is standing in front of the fighting men, who are wrestling on the ground.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: Friends, this is not worth fighting over!
s06e07	The Broken Man	JON SNOW walks past SANSA and away.
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: This’ll be it, now. Right now, we don’t need to be fighting.
s06e07	The Broken Man	One of the men gets in DAVOS’ face.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: Who the fuck are you?
s06e07	The Broken Man	DAVOS: Hold on.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN #2: Yeah, who the fuck are you?
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA spies the maester of Bear Island handling some crates containing ravens. He holds up one of the crates to LYANNA MORMONT.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANSA is writing a letter. She signs her name, pours wax, and presses the wax with the direwolf sigil of House Stark. She picks up the letter and rereads it, then stares ahead.
s06e07	The Broken Man	All of RAY’s followers are gathered together in a circle. RAY is standing in the center, speaking to them all. SANDOR stands at the far end of the flock, behind everyone else. The church framing stands on a hill in the background.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY sits down on a stump next to one of the men and rests his arm on the man’s shoulder.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR looks down.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name. I’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY stands and walks back to the center of the circle.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY stares at SANDOR.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: It’s never too late to come back.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR returns RAY’s gaze but is distracted by three horsemen coming up the way. RAY turns to look at them. SANDOR walks a few paces into the midst of RAY’s followers and stares at the riders.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It’s not even about the gods. It’s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The three riders reach the group and stop. RAY walks out to meet them. All of RAY’s followers stand. The riders are FLYNN, MORGAN, and LEM LEMONCLOAK.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?
s06e07	The Broken Man	LEM: What are you doing here?
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Well, we’re talking about life. You?
s06e07	The Broken Man	LEM: Protecting the people.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?
s06e07	The Broken Man	LEM: Do you have any horses?
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: No horses. No gold. No steel.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LEM: Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I’m sure it is. You’re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LEM: Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
s06e07	The Broken Man	LEM smiles. The three riders turn the horses around and ride off. SANDOR watches them leave.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR is splitting wood with an ax on a chopping block. RAY walks up the path. SANDOR sees him coming but continues chopping.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: “Seven save you, friends.”
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I’m a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: They don’t believe in your Seven. They’re from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR stops chopping.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: Sure, you do. You’ve got food, you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t. And you’ve got women.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR shrugs and sighs.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: It’d be you against all of them. I mean, these people don’t know how to fight.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: You do.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I’m done with fighting.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: Even if it’s to protect yourself?
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: Violence is a disease. You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: You don’t cure it by dying, either.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR resumes chopping.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: You’ve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY starts back up the path.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR: It’s gonna be a cold night. We’ll need firewood.
s06e07	The Broken Man	RAY: I’ll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
s06e07	The Broken Man	People of all sorts line the streets. ARYA walks among them with her hands behind her back. She encounters two men sitting across from each other at a small table.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: He’s not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet’s in Slaver’s Bay. I’m inclined to believe him. I’m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA walks up beside the men and addressing the one who was speaking.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA: You’re Westerosi.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: What do you care?
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA: I want to book passage home.
s06e07	The Broken Man	The man laughs.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: You? Can’t afford it.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA tosses a bag of coins on the table in front of the man. The man opens it and pulls out some coins.
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: Where’d you steal this from?
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA: Why do you care?
s06e07	The Broken Man	MAN: We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA throws another bag of coins on the table.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA: I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA walks past the man and grabs the coin purses off the table on the way.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA: See you at sunrise.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA walks onto a bridge and stops to stare out at the Titan. An old woman approaches her.
s06e07	The Broken Man	WOMAN: Sweet girl.
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA turns to face the old woman. The old woman draws a blade and slashes ARYA across the stomach. She grabs ARYA by the neck and holds her tight to her body, the stabs ARYA severl times in the stomach and twists the blade. With her free hand, she reaches up and pulls off her face, revealing she is the WAIF in disguise. ARYA headbutss the WAIF, pushes her, and then runs and jumps off the opposite side of the bridge, plummeting into the water. The WAIF rushes to the side of the bridge ARYA jumped off and stares into the water. Bubbles and blood rise to the surface. The WAIF straightens her shirt and walks away.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACE SHORE
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA bursts through the surface of the water, gasping. She pulls herself up onto some steps , turns onto her back, and clutches her bleeding stomach.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACE
s06e07	The Broken Man	ARYA stumbles through the crowd, clutching her bleeding stomach and shivering. She looks from face to face. Everyone stares at her blankly.
s06e07	The Broken Man	SANDOR is chopping a branch with a machete. He tosses the machete down and takes a drink of water, then hears people screaming and runs through the woods.
s06e07	The Broken Man	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT
s06e07	The Broken Man	The dead bodies of RAY’s followers are strewn all over the ground. SANDOR walks among them. He approaches the church framing. RAY is hanging by the neck from the framing, dead. SANDOR looks up at him and sighs. He walks to a nearby stump and retrieves an ax.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE and CLARENZO are performing JOFFREY’s death scene in The Bloody Hand. Portraying CERSEI, LADY CRANE is kneeling, cradling CLARENZO’s head. The audience watches silently.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I’ll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life.
s06e08	No One	The crowd cheers. LADY CRANE and CLARENZO stand and bow. LADY CRANE makes her way backstage. She takes off her wig and sits down at her table in the actors’ break room, wiping her eyes. She takes her bottle of rum and begins to pour herself a glass but stops when she hears a rustling from behind a clothing rack. She stands and walks over to the clothing rack, then parts the clothes. ARYA is lying on the ground behind the rack, bleeding from her stomach.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT
s06e08	No One	ARYA is lying in bed. LADY CRANE sits beside her, treating her wounds.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: You’re good at that. Where did you learn?
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: I’m a jealous woman. I’ve always liked bad men and they’ve always liked me. They’d come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore’s perfume.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE stands and carries her tray of medical supplies into the abutting room.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: So we’d fight and I’d put a hole in them. And then I’d feel terrible, so I’d patch them up. I got good at patching them up.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: And good at putting holes in them.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE chuckles. ARYA smiles.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: And that.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: Bianca.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE spoons soup into a bowl and carries it back to ARYA.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: She’ll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE hands ARYA the bowl. ARYA takes it and slurps, then scrunches up her face.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: Mmm.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: I can’t.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: Why not? Got a feeling you’d be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: I don’t think I could remember all of the lines.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: Come with us. What’s left for you here?
s06e08	No One	ARYA: You wouldn’t be safe. Not while she’s looking for me.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: Who?
s06e08	No One	ARYA: She doesn’t have a name.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: Where will you go?
s06e08	No One	ARYA: Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what’s west of Westeros?
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: I don’t know.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: Nobody does. That’s where all the maps stop.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: The edge of the world, maybe.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: I’d like to see that.
s06e08	No One	ARYA is afflicted with pain from her wound. LADY CRANE stands and pours a milky white liquid into a glass.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: What’s that?
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: Milk of the poppy.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: I don’t want any.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE hands ARYA the glass.
s06e08	No One	LADY CRANE: Sleep is the only way you’ll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn’t kill you, nothing will.
s06e08	No One	ARYA takes the glass, stares into it, and then drinks it down. She lays back and LADY CRANE tucks her in. ARYA falls asleep. LADY CRANE touches her hand and dims the candlelight.
s06e08	No One	Four men are sitting around a small campfire, two young and two middle-aged. One of the middle-aged men is named GATINS.
s06e08	No One	MAN: Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?
s06e08	No One	The young men look at each other.
s06e08	No One	YOUNG MAN: Course we do.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: This is for masters, this technique. You’re not ready.
s06e08	No One	YOUNG MAN #2: I’m ready.
s06e08	No One	MAN: He says he’s ready.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: All right.
s06e08	No One	GATINS stands and walks over to YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 stands.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady’s head.
s06e08	No One	GATINS puts his left hand on the back of YOUNG MAN #2’s head.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: Your right hand holds the small of the lady’s back like so.
s06e08	No One	GATINS puts his right hand on the small of YOUNG MAN #2’s back.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.
s06e08	No One	GATINS shoves his hand down the back of YOUNG MAN #2’s pants. YOUNG MAN #2 flails and pulls away. The other middle-aged man bursts out laughing. GATINS smells his finger.
s06e08	No One	MAN: So fucking close!
s06e08	No One	GATINS: Ah, it smells like pussy to me.
s06e08	No One	MAN: Look at him. You get hard, boy?
s06e08	No One	YOUNG MAN #2: Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
s06e08	No One	GATINS sits back down next to the fire. YOUNG MAN #2 remains standing, fixing his pants. SANDOR appears, carrying an ax. He is walking towards YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 has his back turned to him.
s06e08	No One	YOUNG MAN #2: Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?
s06e08	No One	The other three men spot SANDOR coming. They stand. YOUNG MAN #2 turns around to see what’s coming. SANDOR growls and decapitates him. SANDOR approaches the second young man and drives his ax into his chest. The middle-aged man approaches SANDOR from behind with a sword. SANDOR spins around and slices his throat open. SANDOR lunges at GATINS and drives his axe into his groin, then rips it away. Blood spills out and GATINS falls to his knees, whimpering. SANDOR puts his hand on GATINS’ head, forcing him to look up.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Where’s the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: Fuck you!
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better.
s06e08	No One	GATINS: Cunt!
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: You’re shit at dying, you know that?
s06e08	No One	SANDOR raises the ax above his head, growls, and buries it into GATINS.
s06e08	No One	The courtyard is filled with people of all types. People are buying, selling, and renovating. In one area, a red priestess is preaching to a crowd.
s06e08	No One	RED PRIESTESS (speaking Valyrian): From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again.
s06e08	No One	TYRION and VARYS enter, walking together through the courtyard. TYRION smiles.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: I’d call that a successful gambit.
s06e08	No One	VARYS: Would you?
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Look around. The city has come back to life.
s06e08	No One	VARYS: You made a pact with fanatics.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: I did and it worked.
s06e08	No One	VARYS: If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you’d say the razor worked. That doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
s06e08	No One	TYRION and VARYS stop walking and stare out through an archway at the harbor.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: I’m going to miss you.
s06e08	No One	VARYS: I know.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: I hope you’re right about this expedition of yours.
s06e08	No One	VARYS: If I don’t return, you’ll know I was wrong.
s06e08	No One	TYRION broods. VARYS looks at him.
s06e08	No One	VARYS:We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Most of all, we need our queen.
s06e08	No One	VARYS: She’ll come back. She has to. My heart’s been broken too many times already.
s06e08	No One	VARYS pats TYRION on the shoulder.
s06e08	No One	VARYS: I’ll walk the rest of the way myself. I can’t go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
s06e08	No One	TYRION smiles. VARYS walks on.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Varys.
s06e08	No One	VARYS turns back and looks at TYRION.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: The most famous dwarf in the world.
s06e08	No One	VARYS smiles and nods, then walks out into the harbor. TYRION walks back through the courtyard.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI is sitting at a table, drinking. There is a knock on the door. QYBURN enters. GREGOR is standing out in the hall.
s06e08	No One	QYBURN: Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: Have been permitted? That’s rather a tortured way of putting it.
s06e08	No One	QYBURN: They demand to see you, Your Grace.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
s06e08	No One	QYBURN says nothing.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: The king is aware of their presence?
s06e08	No One	QYBURN: He is, Your Grace. He’s currently in his chambers at prayer.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI stands and walks past QYBURN out into the hall. QYBURN bows to her as she passes, then follows her out with GREGOR in tow. At the bottom of the steps, LANCEL and a group of Faith Militant are waiting. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR approach them. One of the Faith Militant stares up at GREGOR.
s06e08	No One	LANCEL: Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
s06e08	No One	LANCEL: Your Grace, this is not a request.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I’m refusing.
s06e08	No One	LANCEL: The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
s06e08	No One	LANCEL: He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: Get out.
s06e08	No One	LANCEL nods at the Faith Militant. Two of them advance with spikes clubs. GREGOR steps in front of CERSEI.
s06e08	No One	LANCEL (to GREGOR): Move aside, ser.
s06e08	No One	GREGOR silently stares out from behind his helmet.
s06e08	No One	LANCEL (to CERSEI): Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: I choose violence.
s06e08	No One	One of the Faith Militant swings his club into GREGOR’s chestplate. GREGOR is unaffected. The club is stuck in the metal of the armor and the Faith Militant man struggles to wrench it free. He pulls it loose and reels back for another swing, but GREGOR takes him by the throat with one hand and lifts him up off the ground. LANCEL and the other Faith Militant regroup in the courtyard. The man in GREGOR’s grasp gasps and drops his club. GREGOR tosses him out into the courtyard, then follows him out. GREGOR kneels over the man, grabs him by the jaw, and rips his head off. LANCEL looks around at the other Faith Militant. CERSEI smiles.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR turn to walk back up the steps.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE and PODRICK arrive on horseback. They stare out at the Lannister/Frey encampment from an overlooking hill.
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: Looks like a siege, my lady.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: You have a keen military mind, Pod.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE spots JAIME riding a white horse among his men.
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: My lady. My lady.
s06e08	No One	Several Lannister soldiers ride towards BRIENNE and PODRICK, and then encircle them.
s06e08	No One	MAN: Who goes there? State your business!
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I’ve come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT
s06e08	No One	PODRICK watches Lannister soldiers riding through the encampment. His is choked from behind by an unknown man who reveals himself to be BRONN.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren’t we?
s06e08	No One	BRONN releases PODRICK. PODRICK coughs. BRONN laughs and slaps PODRICK on the shoulder.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you’d be dead by now.
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: Not yet.
s06e08	No One	BRONN laughs and motions to a nearby tent.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Are they in there?
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: Mm-hmm.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: You think they’re fucking?
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: What? No.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Why not? I’d fuck her. You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: I’m her squire.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Oh. Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure. And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock.
s06e08	No One	BRONN grabs PODRICK’s crotch.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: You must have shown it to her by now.
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: She’s training me to fight.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Is she? Oh.
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: Well, that’s a different sort of fighting.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Now, that’s the truth, isn’t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?
s06e08	No One	PODRICK smiles and nods.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: All right, let’s start with your footwork.
s06e08	No One	BRONN stands across from PODRICK.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Show me your stance.
s06e08	No One	PODRICK postures up.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?
s06e08	No One	PODRICK looks down at his feet. BRONN slaps him across the face.
s06e08	No One	BRONN: Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don’t sulk.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: JAIME’S TENT
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE and JAIME stand across from each other.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I never thought you’d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Why would you assume that?
s06e08	No One	JAIME: In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: I don’t think you know many girls like her.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.
s06e08	No One	JAIME walks around the room and comes to a stop on BRIENNE’s other side. BRIENNE turns to face him.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: I’ve come for the Blackfish.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: You’re welcome to have him.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: The Tully army.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Exactly.
s06e08	No One	JAIME and BRIENNE stare at each other.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: We shouldn’t argue about politics.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: You’re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I’ve seen it myself.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: What do you propose?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Have you ever met the Blackfish?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: No.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: He’s even more stubborn than you are.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE looks down. JAIME walks back around the table to BRIENNE’s other side.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: You have my word. You have until nightfall.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE nods and undoes her sword belt. She hands Oathkeeper to JAIME. JAIME sighs.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: You gave it to me for a purpose. I’ve achieved that purpose.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: It’s yours. It will always be yours.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE stares into JAIME’s eyes, then ties Oathkeeper back on her waist and begins to walk out. JAIME follows her to the entrance of the tent. BRIENNE turns back.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: one last thing, Ser Jaime.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Yes, Lady Brienne?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Of course it does.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: To fight you.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE and JAIME stare into each other’s eyes. BRIENNE exits. JAIME watches her go.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE and PODRICK follow BRYNDEN holding a piece of parchment as he walks along the walls of Riverrun.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: I’ve said no three times already.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: I haven’t seen her since she was a child. I don’t know her signature. I don’t know you. And I will not surrender.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN turns to one of his soldiers.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: Double the guards tonight.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN looks out at the Lannister/Frey encampment.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEL The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN turns on his heel and walks inside. BRIENNE and PODRICK follow him.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: As I have said, my name is- -
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: He always spoke highly of you.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: And if he were here now, I’d tell him the same I’m telling you.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN makes his way down a set of steps.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: If you think I’m abandoning my family’s seat on the Kingslayer’s word of honor, you’re a bloody fool.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN, BRIENNE, and PODRICK emerge into Riverrun’s main courtyard.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: He’s not my friend.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: No?
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN stops and turns back to face BRIENNE.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE holds out the piece of parchment to BRYNDEN. BRYNDEN takes it, unfolds it, and reads its contents. He smiles and chuckles under his breath.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: She’s exactly like her mother.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE smiles. BRYNDEN turns back to face her.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: I don’t have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: You have more than she does.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN hands the letter back to BRIENNE. She takes it. BRYNDEN walks away.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE (to PODRICK): Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
s06e08	No One	PODRICK: What should I write?
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Tell her I failed.
s06e08	No One	A crowd of nobles fills the throne room. CERSEI enters, followed by QYBURN and GREGOR. The crowd stares at them and parts to let them pass. They approach the throne. TOMMEN, KEVAN, and MAESTER PYCELLE stand atop the steps to the throne. KEVAN walks down the steps and confronts CERSEI.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: There’s to be a royal announcement?
s06e08	No One	KEVAN: There is.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: Why wasn’t I informed?
s06e08	No One	KEVAN: There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
s06e08	No One	CERSEi starts up the steps but KEVAN blocks her with his arm.
s06e08	No One	KEVAN: Where are you going?
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: To stand by my son.
s06e08	No One	KEVAN: Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI stares at TOMMEN. TOMMEN looks away. MAESTER PYCELLE whispers to him. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR move to one of the nearby balconies. TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne and addresses the crowd.
s06e08	No One	TOMMEN: Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.
s06e08	No One	Members of the crowd murmur to one another.
s06e08	No One	TOMMEN: Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all.
s06e08	No One	CROWD: Seven blessings.
s06e08	No One	TOMMEN stands and makes his way out of the hall, accompanied by the goldcloaks. CERSEI watches him leave. QYBURN walks up beside CERSEi and whispers to her.
s06e08	No One	QYBURN: Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
s06e08	No One	CERSEI: And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
s06e08	No One	QYBURN: More. Much more.
s06e08	No One	TYRION pours himself a glass of wine. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sit across from him.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: You seem happy.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.
s06e08	No One	TYRION puts down his glass of wine on a table and pours another glass of wine.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Now it’s like a man reborn.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: I will be happy when our queen returns.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?
s06e08	No One	TYRION pours a third glass of wine.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: Unsullied never drink.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Why not?
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: Rules.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: And who made these rules? Your former masters?
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look at each other.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
s06e08	No One	TYRION hands GREY WORM one of the glasses of wine. GREY WORM takes it.
s06e08	No One	TYRION (to MISSANDEI): And you? What’s your excuse?
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM sniffs his glass of wine and scrunches up his face. TYRION hands MISSANDEI the second glass of wine. She takes it.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: That’s how you know it’s working.
s06e08	No One	TYRION returns to his glass of wine and raises it up.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM and MISSANDEI raise their glasses.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM & MISSANDEI: Long may she reign.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sip from their glasses. TYRION drinks all of his.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Do you like it?
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: Tastes like it has turned.
s06e08	No One	TYRION walks to another decanter on the opposite side of the room and pours himself another glass of wine.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.
s06e08	No One	TYRION sips his wine.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.
s06e08	No One	TYRION walks back in front of GREY WORM and MISSANDEI.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: I do not know any jokes.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Grey worm?
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM stares and says nothing.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale...
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI sips her wine.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM and MISSANDEI do not laugh.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: It’s funnier in Westeros.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Yes.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI sips her wine again.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Missandei, do you like the wine?
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: I do.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: Tell a joke.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: Two translators are on a sinking ship.
s06e08	No One	TYRION smiles.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”
s06e08	No One	There is a pause.
s06e08	No One	TYRION Ah!
s06e08	No One	TYRION begins to laugh. MISSANDEI smiles and sips her wine.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: That is the worst joke I ever heard.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: You don’t even know what a joke is.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
s06e08	No One	TYRION: You lied to us.
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: I make joke.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI and TYRION laugh. GREY WORM smiles.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: More jokes.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
s06e08	No One	Bells begin to ring. GREY WORM stands and runs out of the room, shouting in Valyrian.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE
s06e08	No One	A fleet of white-sailed ships approaches Meereen. TYRION and MISSANDEI stare at at the ships.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: The Masters have come for their property.
s06e08	No One	JAIME rides horseback through the encampment, approaches a tent, dismounts, and enters.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Lord Edmure.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE’s hands are behind his back, his wrists bound around a vertical pole in the center of the tent. He is kneeling.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE stands.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: I have your word?
s06e08	No One	EDMURE scoffs.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Oh, good. Good, that’s- - that’s a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you’re playing.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: A son I’ve never met born of a wife that I haven’t seen since our first night together.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you’ve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Says the man who shoved his sword through his king’s back.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not.
s06e08	No One	JAIME sits on a barrel in the corner of the room.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: You understand. On some level you understand that you’re an evil man.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I’ll leave the judgments to the gods.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Well, that is convenient for you. You’re a fine-looking fellow, aren’t you?
s06e08	No One	EDMURE chuckles.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we’re decent, don’t we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you’re decent after everything that you’ve done?
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE laughs.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Yeah. She should have killed you.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don’t?
s06e08	No One	JAIME: No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Oh. Oh, I see. You’re a madman.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I’m not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Don’t talk about Cat!
s06e08	No One	JAIME: I’ll talk about whomever I want.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE grunts and struggles against his bindings.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see.
s06e08	No One	JAIME stands and walks closer to EDMURE.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: They’d do anything to protect their babies.
s06e08	No One	JAIME gets in EDMURE’s face.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: You didn’t come here to talk about our sisters.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE struggles against his bindings, pushing himself towards JAIME.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL
s06e08	No One	EDMURE crosses the bridge over Riverrun’s moat, carrying a torch. Several guards point crossbows down at him. He stops at the end of the bridge.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: Who goes there?
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN appears on the wall with the guards.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: Don’t let him in.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: He’s the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: He’s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it’s a trap, you idiot. Don’t let him in.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN turns to walk away.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: He’s my lord, my lord. I’ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN turns back.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: You’re not obeying Edmure’s commands. You’re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer’s commands.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE (O.S.): I demand entry.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: My lord has given an order.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
s06e08	No One	The guard captain turns to his fellow guards.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword halfway. The guard captain and the other guards show their steel.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: I’ll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: You are not lord of this castle, my lord.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN looks around at the other guards, sheathes his sword, and walks away.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: Lower the drawbridge!
s06e08	No One	GUARD: Aye, ser!
s06e08	No One	The drawbridge begins to open. EDMURE stares back across the Lannister/Frey encampment. JAIME waits on his horse. BLACK WALDER rides up beside JAIME. The drawbridge fully extends. EDMURE walks inside.
s06e08	No One	BLACK WALDER (to JAIME): If you’re wrong, we’re just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.
s06e08	No One	The drawbridge closes behind EDMURE. Riverrun soldiers are gathered to meet him. BRYNDEN appears in the rear of their ranks. EDMURE spots BRYNDEN, hands his torch to one of the soldiers, and walks up the stairs to the top of the outer wall.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: Welcome home, my lord.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN: My lord- -
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Your lord has given a command.
s06e08	No One	The drawbridge opens. JAIME glances at BLACK WALDER and rides towards Riverrun. The Lannister and Frey forces follow him into Riverrun.
s06e08	No One	EDMURE: Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
s06e08	No One	GUARD CAPTAIN (to a guard): Find him.
s06e08	No One	The Riverrun soldiers lay down their arms in a pile as the Lannister forces enter the castle.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN, PODRICK, and BRIENNE emerge from a doorway. BRYNDEN places the torch in a sconce and stands in the doorway. PODRICK gets onto a small rowboat floating on the surface of the river. BRIENNE kneels to steady the rowboat for PODRICK, then turns back to look at BRYNDEN.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: Go on.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN stands and faces him.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Come with us.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: I’ve run before from the Red Wedding. I’m not running again. This is my family home.
s06e08	No One	BRIENNE: Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don’t die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: You’ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
s06e08	No One	Some guards begin shouting in the background.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: Go on, now.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN: I haven’t had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I’ll make a damn fool of myself.
s06e08	No One	BRYNDEN heads through the doorway and back up the steps. BRIENNE watches him leave and then gets on the rowboat.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: RIVERRUN - COURTYARD
s06e08	No One	Lannister and Frey banners are being draped all over the courtyard. Lannister soldiers walk over the fallen Tully banners.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL
s06e08	No One	JAIME stands atop the outer wall. A Lannister guard enters and approaches him.
s06e08	No One	GUARD: We found the Blackfish, my lord.
s06e08	No One	JAIME: Good. Bring him to me.
s06e08	No One	GUARD: He died fighting, my lord.
s06e08	No One	JAIME nods to the guard. The guard exits. JAIME stares out at the river and sees BRIENNE and PODRICK rowing away from Riverrun. He looks around to see if anyone else is watching. BRIENNE looks over her shoulder and sees JAIME standing atop the wall. JAIME waves to her. BRIENNE waves back.
s06e08	No One	The Masters’ fleet is launching flaming projectiles at Meereen and the Great Pyramid, setting them ablaze.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM
s06e08	No One	TYRION and MISSANDEI enter. GREY WORM is waiting for them. Many Unsullied stand guard around the room.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: I was wrong. I admit it.
s06e08	No One	MISSANDEI: That changes nothing.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers’ forces- -
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: And I have acknowledged that. I’m trying- -
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: You’re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: All right, what should the army do?
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.
s06e08	No One	TYRION: And then?
s06e08	No One	GREY WORM: We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
s06e08	No One	Something thuds and rattles the roof of the pyramid. Footsteps can be heard. Everyone looks up. MISSANDEI grabs a knife from a table and stands beside TYRION. GREY WORM and the Unsullied form up in front of the door to the balcony. One Unsullied opens the door. Another inches out through it, shield and spear in hand. The Unsullied man looks side to side and sees nothing, but then sees something and kneels. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit. DAENERYS enters. A dragon screeches and flies away in the background.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR walks along the center of a path through the woods, carrying an ax and a satchel. He hears horses whinnying and the voices of men. He follows the sounds and happens upon BERIC DONDARRION, THOROS OF MYR, and other members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. They are preparing to hang LEM and two of his accomplices, who stand on blocks ith nooses tied around their necks. BERIC turns to see SANDOR. Some of the Brotherhood members brandish weapons.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: Clegane.
s06e08	No One	THOROS: What the fuck you doing here?
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Chasing them. You?
s06e08	No One	THOROS: Hanging them.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Any particular reason?
s06e08	No One	BERIC: They’re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
s06e08	No One	THOROS: You’ve got friends?
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Not anymore. They’re mine.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR advances. BERIC and another member of the Brotherhood block his path.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Fuck your name. They’re mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again.
s06e08	No One	One of the Brotherhood members notches an arrow and points his bow at SANDOR.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR points his ax at the man but keeps his eyes locked on BERIC.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR walks towards the bowman.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: You can have one of them.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR turns back to face BERIC, glances at the men about to be hanged, then looks back at BERIC.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Two.
s06e08	No One	BERIC looks at THOROS. THOROS nods. BERIC nods to SANDOR. SANDOR approaches one of the men and raises his ax above his head to swing. THOROS catches the ax’s handle from behind.
s06e08	No One	THOROS: No, no, no.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR turns to face THOROS and tries to wrench his ax free.
s06e08	No One	THOROS: We’re not butchers. We hang them.
s06e08	No One	THOROS releases SANDOR’s ax.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: hanging? All over in an instant. Where’s the punishment in that?
s06e08	No One	THOROS: They die.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: We all bloody die.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR gestures to BERIC.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Except this one here. I’ll only gut one of them.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: No.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: I’ll chop off one hand.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That’s generous.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Bunch of nancies.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR throws down his ax.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
s06e08	No One	THOROS: You’re getting old, Clegane.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: He’s not.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath one of the men, hanging him. He moves in front of LEM.
s06e08	No One	LEM: Please don’t. I’ll give you anything.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath LEM, hanging him. LEM gasps for air. BERIC hangs the third man. SANDOR pulls the boot off of LEM’s foot. BERIC and THOROS begin to walk away, but turn back to look at SANDOR. SANDOR takes off his own boot and sizes up LEM’s boot to his own foot. He shoves his foot into LEM’s boot and looks up at BERIC and THOROS.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Got anything to eat?
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT
s06e08	No One	Several members of the Brotherhood are sitting around small campfires. SANDOR, BERIC, and some other Brothers are sitting at one such campfire. SANDOR is eating a piece of meat. THOROS approaches and sits beside them.
s06e08	No One	THOROS (to SANDOR): Enjoying yourself?
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: I prefer chicken.
s06e08	No One	THOROS hands SANDOR a water skin. SANDOR drinks from it.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: You ought to join us. We could use you.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: I tried joining. Didn’t work out for me.
s06e08	No One	THOROS: Clegane, we’re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR returns the water skin to THOROS, stands, walks to the river, and urinates into it.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: Cold winds are rising in the North.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: And you’re going to go stop them?
s06e08	No One	BERIC: We need good men to help us.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
s06e08	No One	SANDOR laughs.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR: I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now.
s06e08	No One	SANDOR returns to his spot by the campfire and sits.
s06e08	No One	BERIC: Aye, you’re probably right. You’re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you.
s06e08	No One	ARYA is sleeping. LADY CRANE enters the bedroom, sits down beside ARYA, and strokes her face. ARYA stirs and groans. LADY CRANE stands and walks back into the abutting room. She retrieves a stool and stands atop it, reaching for a bottle on top of a bureau. She turns around and sees a young man with blonde hair. Cut to ARYA’s perspective. There is a thud. ARYA awakens with a gasp and looks around. She sees a shadow moving in the abutting room.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: Lady Crane?
s06e08	No One	ARYA gets out of bed and winces. She walks towards the abutting room.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: Lady Crane?
s06e08	No One	ARYA enters the abutting room and sees LADY CRANE lying crumpled on top of the stool, dead. Blood is pooled on the ground beneath her.
s06e08	No One	WAIF: If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly.
s06e08	No One	ARYA turns to see the WAIF standing in the doorway with a knife. The WAIF approaches ARYA slowly and ARYA backs away, matching her pace.
s06e08	No One	WAIF: Instead…
s06e08	No One	The WAIF holds out her arms.
s06e08	No One	WAIF: The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can’t change that. I can’t change that. No one can. And now he’s been promised another name.
s06e08	No One	ARYA turns around, runs out onto the balcony, and jumps off. She grunts as her hands and feet connect with the ground. The sprints off through the streets, pushing people out of the way. The WAIF emerges from the door to LADY CRANE’s apartment, spies ARYA, and chases after her. ARYA runs through an alleyway. A man pushes a cart in her way. She slides underneath it and continues running. The WAIF jumps clean over the cart. ARYA turns a corner and runs down a set of stairs. A woman dumps a barrel of water on the ground outside the door to a room at the bottom of the steps. ARYA sees her and darts into the room. The WAIF turns the corner to the steps but stops when she does not see ARYA. The room ARYA has entered is a sauna. She moves through it. A number of men in towels are relaxing in the heat. ARYA emerges from the door on the opposite side of the sauna and looks around. She enters the crowd, walking through it. The WAIF appears on a high wall behind her, then jumps down into the crowd. ARYA turns back to see her and runs away. The WAIF pursues her. ARYA reaches the end of the marketplace and jumps off a high wall. She lands on a large set of steps where many fruit merchants have laid their baskets. She tumbles down the steps, knocking over the baskets as she goes and grunting with pain. The crowd clamors. ARYA comes to a stop at the bottom of the steps. She puts her hand to her stomach. Her hand comes away bloody. The WAIF appears at the top of the steps. ARYA sees her, stands, and throws herself over a small wall into an alleyway. The WAIF follows her. ARYA whimpers as she moves through the alleyway. She leaves blood stains on everything she touches. She enters a small, dark room, lit by a single candle. The WAIF follows her inside, knife in hand. ARYA kneels in the small living space she has made for herself. The WAIF enters and shuts the door behind her.
s06e08	No One	WAIF: It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
s06e08	No One	ARYA retrieves Needle from beneath a blanket and stands.
s06e08	No One	WAIF: Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you.
s06e08	No One	The WAIF advances. ARYA holds Needle up in front of her face, closes her eyes, and cuts the candle in half. The room goes dark.
s06e08	No One	CUT TO: BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
s06e08	No One	JAQEN enters the main hall. He notices a blood trail on the floor leading to the Hall of Faces. He follows the trail and enters the Hall. The trail leads to one of the columns bearing the faces. The WAIF’s bloody face rests in one of the sconces.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: You told her to kill me.
s06e08	No One	ARYA appears behind JAQEN, pointing Needle at him. JAQEN turns to face her.
s06e08	No One	JAQEN: Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
s06e08	No One	JAQEN pushes his chest against Needle’s point.
s06e08	No One	JAQEN: Finally a girl is no one.
s06e08	No One	ARYA: A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home.
s06e08	No One	JAQEN smiles. ARYA turns and exits.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The Masters’ men are launching flaming projectiles at the Great Pyramid and surrounding city from their ships. DAENERYS watches from atop a balcony of the Great Pyramid. She returns to the interior, to the conference room where TYRION awaits. DAENERYS approaches him. An explosion occurs outside.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	An explosion occurs outside.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Perhaps we should take shelter.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	An explosion occurs outside.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: The city is on the rise?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	An explosion occurs outside.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	An explosion occurs outside.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: ...it proves that no one needs a Master.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: Good. Shall we begin?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Do we have a plan?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION tightens his jaw and looks away.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: You don’t approve?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	An explosion occurs outside.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: This is entirely different.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	A blast causes the window across the room to explode inward, sending shards of wood flying everywhere. DAENERYS and TYRION duck, then turn to look at the window.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: MEEREEN - PLATEAU
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS, TYRION, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and an assembly of Unsullied stand across from the three Masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION, and a group of their soldiers.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAZDAL (to DAENERYS): Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YEZZAN: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAZDAL: I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: My reign has just begun.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	A dragon screeches in the distance. YEZZAN turns to look in the direction of the screech. DROGON flies up over the plateau and lands on an overlooking structure. He roars and drops down beside DAENERYS. DAENERYS climbs on his back and they fly off over Meereen. When they pass over the entrance to the catacombs, RHAEGAL and VISERION bust down the door with flame and take flight to join them. The ensemble flies over the beach entrance to Meereen.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: MEEREEN - BEACH ENTRANCE
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	A group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen. Galloping footsteps can be heard in the distance. One of the Sons of the Harpy turns to look in the direction of the sound. The Dothraki horde led by DAARIO rounds the bend of a nearby cliff, yelling war cries and charging full force towards the Sons of the Harpy on horseback. DAARIO beheads a Son of the Harpy.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: MEEREEN - HARBOR
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS and the dragons fly over the Masters’ ships. The soldiers on the ships stop what they’re doing and stare up at the dragons. DAENERYS and DROGON come to a halt and hover in front of one of the ships.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: Dracarys.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The dragons shoot stream of fire down at the the ship. The ship becomes engulfed in flame and the soldiers scream as they die. The ship incinerates and capsizes.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: MEEREEN - PLATEAU
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	GREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters’ soldiers.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): You men have a choice:
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The Unsullied ready their spears. The Masters’ soldiers ready their swords.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	GREY WORM: ...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	A dragon screeches in the distance. The Masters’ soldiers lay down their arms and run away.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MISSANDEI: Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAZDAL grabs YEZZAN.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAZDAL: Him. He should die.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	BELICHO: Yes, him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION looks at GREY WORM.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAZDAL: He’s not one of us. He’s an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	GREY WORM approaches the YEZZAN and stares in his eyes.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YEZZAN: Please.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YEZZAN falls to his knees. GREY WORM unsheathes his dagger and slices RAZDAL and BELICHO’s throats. He sheathes his dagger and steps back. TYRION approaches YEZZAN and puts his hand on his shoulder.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION pats YEZZAN on the shoulder. He, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI walk away.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW, SANSA, DAVOS, TORMUND, LYANNA MORMONT, and some Stark bannermen sit on horseback, waiting. RAMSAY, HARALD KARSTARK, SMALLJON UMBER, and a group of Bolton soldiers approach on horseback. They come to a halt in front of JON SNOW and compnay.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: You don’t have to be here.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: Yes, I do.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: My beloved wife. I’ve missed you terribly.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY looks at JON SNOW.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I’m a man of mercy.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY chuckles.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don’t know if I’d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY points at JON SNOW.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: He’s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: How do we know you have him?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY nods to SMALLJON. SMALLJON pulls SHAGGYDOG’s head out from a satchel and throws it on the ground.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Now, if you want to save —
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA turns her horse and rides away.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): She’s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you’re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven’t fed them for seven days. They’re ravenous. I wonder which parts they’ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY and company ride back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW looks down.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW, DAVOS, TORMUND, and SANSA are standing around a planning table.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND looks at DAVOS.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: A pincer move.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW. JON SNOW and DAVOS look at each other briefly.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Good.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND (to JON SNOW): Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: We should all get some sleep.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS, TORMUND, and any remaining attendants exit. JON SNOW sits down at the head of the table.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Aye, for what they’re worth.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: You’re right.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: You think he’s going to fall into your trap. He won’t He’s the one who lays traps.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: He’s overconfident.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: He plays with people. He’s far better at it than you. He’s been doing it all his life.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW stands.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: You don’t know him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: We can’t give up on our brother.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Of course he does. What should I do differently?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Aye, that’s good advice.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: You think that’s obvious?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Well, it is a bit obvious.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: It’s not enough!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive. Do you understand me?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW I won’t ever let him touch you again. I’ll protect you, I promise.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA exits. JON SNOW turns, looks at the table, and sighs.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS and TORMUND are walking together through the encampment.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: You think there’s hope?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: You saw these demons?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: What?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	They stop walking. DAVOS looks at TORMUND.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Jon Snow’s not a king.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: No, he’s not.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND and DAVOS smile at each other.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: So what do you do all night?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND laughs.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Happy shitting.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND walks away.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE is sitting at a desk with a mirror and candles on it, staring into a fire pit. JON SNOW enters and approaches her.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: My lady. You weren’t at the war council.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: I’m not a soldier.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Any advice?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: Don’t lose.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: I’ll have to try.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: I’m ordering you not to bring me back.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: I am not your servant, Jon Snow.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: How do you know what he commands?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Why?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: What kind of god would do something like that?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MELISANDRE: The one we’ve got.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW stares into the fire pit and then exits.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS is walking alone through the snow. He happens upon a pile of wooden rubble and stops to inspect it. He sees a charred statuette of a stag in the wood and stops to pick it up. He looks back at the pile of wood. A horn blows in the distance. DAVOS looks in the direction of the horn, then hands his head.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS is sitting on the throne. TYRION stands beside her. They are attending to THEON and YARA, who are standing on the steps in front of them.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION (to THEON): Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: It was a long time ago.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: And he paid for them.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: Not my claim. Hers.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: And what’s wrong with you?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: I’m not fit to rule.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: We can agree upon that at least.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: No more than Westeros.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS smiles.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: You and I have that in common.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS turns to TYRION.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: Will their ships be enough?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: There are and Euron is building more. He’s going to offer them to you.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: So why shouldn’t I wait for him?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing. He also wants to give you --
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: The Seven Kingdoms.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: All of them.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	THEON: Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: And that’s all?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: Reasonable.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TYRION: What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS stands and approaches YARA.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: That’s our way of life.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAENERYS: No more.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA and THEON look at each other. THEON nods. YARA turns back to DAENERYS.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA: No more.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	YARA extends her hand to DAENERYS. DAENERYS looks back at TYRION. TYRION makes a shaking motion with his hand. DAENERYS and YARA grab each other’s arms.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The Stark and Bolton armies sit across the battlefield from one another. DAVOS sits on horseback among the ranks of the Stark army. JON SNOW rides his own horse through the ranks, looking at the men. He rides up next to TORMUND and WUN WUN, at the front of the line. Across the battlefield, X-shaped pyres resembling the sigil of House Bolton are burning. Attached to each of them is the body of a flayed man, strapped upside down. RAMSAY rides through the ranks of the Bolton army on horseback with a rope in his hand. RAMSAY reaches the front of the line and dismounts. The rope is revealed to be tied around RICKON’s hands. RAMSAY ushers RICKON a little further out past the front line and stares at JON SNOW across the field. He unsheathes a dagger and raises it in the air. JON SNOW dismounts and walks a few paces out into the field. RAMSAY lowers the dagger and cuts RICKON’s bindings.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That’s it. That’s the game. Easy. Ready? Go.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RICKON starts walking out into the field, then looks back at RAMSAY.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	A soldier approaches and hands RAMSAY his bow. RICKON starts running across the field. RAMSAY draws an arrow from his quiver. JON SNOW jumps on his horse and begins galloping across the field towards RICKON. RAMSAY notches an arrow and fires. The arrow lands in the ground next to RICKON. RAMSAY fires another arrow. It lands on the ground next to RICKON. JON SNOW and RICKON are getting closer. JON SNOW extends his hand out to RICKON. RAMSAY shoots another arrow. It misses. JON SNOW and RICKON are feet away from each other. An arrow pierces through RICKON’s chest from behind. RICKON falls to the ground. JON comes to a halt beside him and looks down at him. RICKON gasps and then dies. JON SNOW looks up at RAMSAY.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND (to himself): Don’t.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY smiles and gives his bow back to the soldier.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The Bolton archers draw and loose a volley of arrows. JON SNOW ushers his horse into a gallop straight towards the Bolton army.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: Go! Go! Follow your commander!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Run and fight!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	WUN WUN roars. The bulk of the Stark forces charge across the field towards the Boltons. JON SNOW continues to rush the Bolton forces alone. The Bolton arches released a volley of arrows, some of which land in the body of JON SNOW’s horse, causing him and his horse to tumble to the ground.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Now.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	KARSTARK: Cavalry, charge!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW stands to face the Bolton cavalry, charging at him. He takes off his sword belt and draws his sword. The cavalry approaches. Just before it’s upon him, the Stark forces rush past JON SNOW and collide with the Bolton charge. Men on both sides die in the frenzy. Bodies and weaponry fly everywhere. Archers on both sides of the battlefield nock arrows and draw their bows.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: We’ll just kill our own men. Stand down.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The Stark arches do not fire.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Loose!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The Bolton archers fire. Their arrows rain down on Stark and Bolton men alike. In the fray, JON SNOW dodges several horses which gallop past him. One Bolton cavalryman charges with his horse, but JON SNOW cuts him down. JON SNOW rushes forward and kills a man on the ground, then slices the belly of a second man. A volley of arrows rains down around JON SNOW. He ducks. None of the arrows hit him. He returns to his feet and cuts down another man, dodges the strike of a passing Bolton cavalryman, and runs through another Bolton footsoldier. A Stark footsoldier helps him finish the Bolton man, and JON SNOW grabs him by the shirt.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: Get word --
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow. JON SNOW stares down at the man and then flies into a rage, killing two more Bolton soldiers. A third man runs at him but is knocked down by a galloping horse. JON SNOW runs over to where he landed and stabs him several times. A horseman gallops at JON SNOW with his ax ready, but a passing Stark cavalryman spears him. Another Bolton footsoldier approaches JON SNOW, but JON SNOW cuts him down. The bodies are beginning to pile up on the battlefield. RAMSAY’s archers loose several more volleys. JON SNOW goes into a frenzy, killing many Bolton men. The bodies have piled up high enough to create small mountains of bodies. Men continue to fight atop and around them.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: We may as well be taking shits back here.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS dismounts his horse.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: Follow!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS unsheathes his sword and charges across the field. The remainder of the Stark forces charge after him. On the other side of the battlefield, RAMSAY smiles and acknowledges SMALLJON.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: It’s time, go.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SMALLJON brandishes his sword and walks back and forth in front of his men.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SMALLJON: Who owns the North?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	ALL: We do!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SMALLJON: Who owns the North?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	ALL: We do!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SMALLJON: Show me!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SMALLJON and his men cheer and charge across the battlefield. JON SNOW continues fighting, but is knocked to the ground by a Bolton footsoldier. TORMUND appears and stabs the footsoldier through the back, then helps JON SNOW to his feet.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Hey!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	WUN WUN and the Wildlings charge up behind TORMUND and JON SNOW. SMALLJON and his men are charging from the other side. WUN WUN points at them and grunts. A force of Bolton men appear bearing tall shields and spears. They create a half-circle around JON SNOW, TORMUND, DAVOS, WUN WUN, and the entire Stark forces. The other half of the circle is blocked by the piles of bodies on the battlefield. The shield soldiers set their shields firmly in the dirt, then point their spears inward towards the Stark forces.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MAN: Infantry, advance!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The shield soldiers grunt in unison, lift their shields, and move in towards the Stark forces. With each wave of movement, they stab more and more Stark soldiers with their spears. One Stark soldier tries to climb up over the piles of bodies but gets cut down by SMALLJON. SMALLJON and his men charge down over the bodies, taking the Stark forces from the rear.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	DAVOS: With me, lads! Break their line!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	WUN WUN rushes the shield wall and swipes at the spears. TORMUND jumps to the side of some spears and attacks a man behind the shield wall. Several other Stark men rush towards the shield wall. JON SNOW and other Stark soldiers defend against SMALLJON’s men. Many soldiers die on both sides, and the bodies begin to pile up again. WUN WUN rips a man in half. TORMUND pulls a shieldbearer down and kills him, but gets sliced across the arm and is fored to fall back among the Stark ranks.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MAN: Tormund!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MAN #2: Get him back!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The shieldbearers advance, pushing the Stark forces further in on themselves. More Stark men die.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND: Fuck this, come on!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	TORMUND leads the Wildlings back towards the piles of bodies. JON SNOW and SMALLJON spot each other, but before they can engage, the Wildling charge overtakes them. In the fray, JON SNOW is pushes to the bottom of several bodies and starts getting crushed. He struggles to get out, but can’t get a hold. TORMUND faces off against SMALLJON. TORMUND punches SMALLJON in the face, and SMALLJON responds with an overhead swing of his sword. TORMUND blocks it. More and more bodies are piling on top of JON SNOW. He can see glimpses of clashes and flailing limbs above, but nothing else. He gasps for air. SMALLJON knocks TORMUND to the ground and punches him in the face multiple times. Men are dying all around JON SNOW as he is being trampled. JON SNOW grabs onto the clothes of a standing men and hoists himself up. He emerges in the center of a tightly packed group of his men and fills his lungs with air. He spots WUN WUN fighting off some shieldbearers. WUN WUN is stabbed in the side, grunts, and pulls the spear out. SMALLJON repeatedly headbutts TORMUND in the face. DAVOS and JON SNOW look at each other. A horn begins to sound in the distance. SMALLJON stops headbutting TORMUND. TORMUND seizes the opportunity and tears into the skin of SMALLJON’s neck with his teeth, then draws a small knife and stabs SMALLJON repeatedly. RAMSAY looks in the direction of the sounding horn. A force of cavalry appears across the battlefield carrying flags bearing the white falcon sigil of House Arryn. SANSA and PETYR BAELISH sit on horseback beside the charging Arryn cavalry. TORMUND kills SMALLJON and screams. The Arryn cavalry takes the Bolton shieldbearers from the rear, then circles around and knocks them all down. SANSA smiles. JON SNOW climbs up to the top of the piles of bodies and spots RAMSAY on his horse. WUN WUN and TORMUND climb up beside JON SNOW. RAMSAY sees JON SNOW, turns his horse around, and rides back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW, TORMUND, and WUN WUN chase after him. SANSA watches them go.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY and several Bolton soldiers enter the courtyard through Winterfell’s main gate. Some men close and bar the gate behind them and they dismount.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Their army’s gone.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	MAN: Our army’s gone.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: We have Winterfell. They don’t have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	Something thuds against the gate. RAMSAY turns to look at it. Several Bolton archers nock arrows. Several more thuds occur against the other side of the gate. WUN WUN busts a hole in the gate. BOLTON archers shoot arrows at his hand and down at his body over the side of the castle wall. WUN WUN roars and punches another hole in the gate. RAMSAY moves farther away from the gate’s interior. WUN WUN reaches in and grabs the wooden bar holding the gate, but a Bolton soldier throws a spear through the back of his hand. WUN WUN rips his hand away and then bursts through the gate, opening it. He sprints into the courtyard, then falls to his knees. The Bolton archers continue shooting arrows into him. He roars. Stark soldiers flood the courtyard and beginning killing the Bolton soldiers, quickly overtaking them. JON SNOW enters the courtyard and runs up beside WUN WUN. They look at each other. TORMUND runs up beside WUN WUN, on his other side. JON SNOW reaches out to WUN WUN, but RAMSAY shoots WUN WUN in the eye with an arrow, killing him.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	Stark archers aim their bows at RAMSAY.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: I’ve reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY notches an arrow. JON SNOW drops his sword and picks up a shield. RAMSAY aims at JON SNOW and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks another arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks a third arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. Before RAMSAY can nock a fourth arrow, JON SNOW overtakes him. JON SNOW bashes RAMSAY with his shield twice, knocking him over. JON SNOW drops his shield and jumps on top of RAMSAY, then punches him in the raise over and over. RAMSAY’s faces becomes mangled and bleeds. SANSA enters the courtyard. JON SNOW sees her and stops punching RAMSAY. He stands and walks away. The Bolton flags fall away from the walls of Winterfell and are replaced by Stark flags. MELISANDRE watches from a balcony. DAVOS, holding the charred stag statuette, stares up at her. Some Stark men carry RICKON’s body into the courtyard on a stretcher and stop in front of JON SNOW, TORMUND, and SANSA.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW: We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The stretcher men continue on. JON SNOW turns to walk away.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: Jon.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: Where is he?
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - KENNELS
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY is tied to a chair inside the kennel gates. He is mangled and bleeding. He groans and coughs, then raises his head to see SANSA standing outside the gate.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I’ll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That’s all right. You can’t kill me. I’m part of you now.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The dogs growl in their cells and begin filtering out into the kennel.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: My hounds will never harm me.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: You haven’t fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: They’re loyal beasts.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	SANSA: They were. Now they’re starving.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The dogs growl. One approaches RAMSAY from the front and puts its front paws up on his legs. It sniffs RAMSAY’s face.
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	RAMSAY: Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
s06e09	Battle of the Bastards	The dog bites RAMSAY’s face. RAMSAY screams. The dogs converge on RAMSAY and begin tearing him apart. SANSA turns as though she might leave, but lingers for a moment to watch. SANSA turns and walks away, then smiles.

s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: To which crimes will you be confessing?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS: All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The crowd murmurs.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS: I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: The gods’ judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS kneels.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS: I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: You understand fully what this means?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS: I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: Brother Loras…
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS begins to cry.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: ...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The HIGH SPARROW touches LORAS’ face. LORAS looks up at him.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS: I will.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The HIGH SPARROW smiles. The HIGH SPARROW nods. Two Faith Militant approach LORAS and take him by the arms. A third approaches him from behind, draws a knife, and begins carving the mark of the Seven into LORAS’ forehead. MACE stirs.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MACE: No, I can’t let them…
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY blocks her father with her arm.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: Faith is the way, Father.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LORAS whinces.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The handmaiden finishes dressing CERSEI and steps away from her.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	Someone approaches TOMMEN.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TOMMEN: All right. I’m ready.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TOMMEN stands and turns around. GREGOR is standing in the doorway.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TOMMEN: I have to go, I’m-- I’m late for the trial.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TOMMEN walks towards GREGOR. GREGOR puts his hand on TOMMEN’s shoulder, blocking his path.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The handmaiden exits. CERSEI looks over her shoulder.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The Faith Militant has finished carving LORAS’s forehead. KEVAN watches from the crowd. MARGAERY has made her way to the floor in front of the HIGH SPARROW.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: You mutilated him. You gave me your word.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: I’ve kept my word. Once the queen mother’s trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: And where is the queen mother?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL: Her litter never left the Red Keep.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: It appears the queen mother doesn’t wish to attend her own trial.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI pours herself a glass of wine.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW (to LANCEL): Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL nods and exits with several Faith Militant.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI walks to the balcony with her glass of wine.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL emerges onto the steps with the Faith Militant. He sees a boy running down the steps. The boy looks over his shoulder at LANCEL.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL: Get the others.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The other Faith Militant disperse. LANCEL looks over the railing and sees the boy enter a door at the foot of the steps.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The young girl opens the door and leads PYCELLE inside. PYCELLE looks around.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL runs to the door the boy entered and then goes inside. It leads to a tunnel. LANCEL sees the boy running down the tunnel with a lit torch. He starts after the boy.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PYCELLE walks down the steps and into the lab, then turns around to see QYBURN sitting in a chair behind him.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PYCELLE: Where’s the king?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN: Elsewhere, I’m afraid.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PYCELLE: What’s the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN: Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PYCELLE turns around. A young boy emerges from the shadows with a knife.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL continues to follow the boy through the tunnels.

s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL runs down the tunnel after the boy.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN: This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The girl who led PYCELLE into the room brandishes a knife.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL turns a corner and finds a smaller tunnel. He gets down on his hands and knees and crawls through it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The children converge on PYCELLE. PYCELLE slaps one of them but is overwhelmed. The children stab him repeatedly with their knives, killing him. QYBURN watches.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL happens upon the boy’s torch and raises it up.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL: The longer you wait, the worse it’ll be for you.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL spies a side passageway lined with barrels. The boy sneaks up on him and stabs him in the side. LANCEL yells and falls to the ground. The boy runs away. LANCEL breathes heavily. The boy returns and looks at LANCEL.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL: What are you doing?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The boy runs away.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The crowd is murmuring. MARGAERY looks around at them, then looks at LORAS. LORAS is hanging his head, his eyes downcast.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL looks down the tunnel and sees a glimmer of light. He drags himself through the dirt towards it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI is standing at the balcony, staring out at the Great Sept of Baelor.

s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY looks around.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL crawls closer to the other end of the hall. There is a green glow all around him.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY hurries over to the HIGH SPARROW.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: There’s something wrong.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HIGH SPARROW: If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I’m telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The HIGH SPARROW scoffs and shakes his head.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL has almost reached the end of the tunnel. He sees green pools of liquid on the ground in front of two barrels with candles in their centers. The candles have almost burned down to nothing. He looks around at the casks lining the walls of the tunnel and pulls himself onward towards the candles.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY (to the crowd): We all need to leave now!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY hurries over to LORAS. The crowd begins to stir. MARGAERY takes LORAS’ chin and lifts his face so his eyes meet hers.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: Loras. Stay with me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY ushers him towards the steps.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL groans as he pulls himself closer to the candles.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY hurries towards the exit with LORAS. The crowd begins to panic and also heads towards the exit. Two Faith Militant block MARGAERY’s path to the exit.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY pushes against the guards. The HIGH SPARROW looks around at the crowd.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY: Let us through!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LANCEL reaches the candles. He tries to blow out the flame with his breath, but it won’t go out.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MARGAERY looks over her shoulder at the HIGH SPARROW. They stare into each other’s eyes.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The flame from the candle touches the pool of green liquid and ignites it. The surrounding barrels are ignited and explode in a mass of green flame. LANCEL is incinerated. The explosion travels down the tunnel, igniting all of the barrels.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The sound of an explosion can be heard. The green flame erupts from the center of the sept, incinerating the HIGH SPARROW and then engulfing the entire sept, killing everyone inside. The sept crumbles from the force of the explosion. The bell from its tower is flung down into the city, smashing into a bystander. The flames rush out from the sept.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI watches the explosion. She cocks her head back, then smiles, sips her wine, and walks away.

s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SEPTA UNELLA is lying strapped to a table. CERSEI stands over her and pours wine in her face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles against her bindings.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Confess. Confess.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI raises a pitcher of wine over SEPTA UNELLA’s head.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SEPTA UNELLA: No.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Confess.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI pours the pitcher into SEPTA UNELLA’s face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles. When the pitcher is empty, SEPTA UNELLA gasps for air.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI touches SEPTA UNELLA’s face.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: You’ve always been quiet.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI walks around the table.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SEPTA UNELLA: Good. I’m glad to see your face. I’m ready to meet the gods.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: What? Now? Today? You’re not going to die today. You’re not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	GREGOR enters the room.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He’s quiet, too.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SEPTA UNELLA looks at GREGOR. GREGOR removes his helmet. His face is cloaked in shadow.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI walks towards the exit. GREGOR enters. His face is purple and mangled. He puts his helmet down on the table next to SEPTA UNELLA.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SEPTA UNELLA: No.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SEPTA UNELLA struggles against her bindings, then cries out in pain.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Shame.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI take hold of the door and closes it behind her.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Shame.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SEPTA UNELLA screams.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Shame.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI closes the latch on the door’s porthole and walks away. SEPTA UNELLA screams.

s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TOMMEN is staring out the window.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ATTENDANT: I’m very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The attendant exits. TOMMEN takes his crown off his head and walks to another part of the room. He returns to the window, stands up on the sill, and plummets off the edge.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	A banquet is underway. WALDER FREY is making a toast. JAIME and BRONN sit at the tables with the Frey and Lannister men, listening.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: For House Lannister!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MEN: Hear me roar!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The men cheer.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: For House Frey!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MEN: We stand together!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The men cheer.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The men cheer.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: And when we drive our swords through our enemies’ hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.”
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The men cheer. A handmaiden looks at BRONN and then at JAIME.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: You don’t even have to do anything, do you?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME looks at the handmaiden.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: You’re welcome to her.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: She doesn’t want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME nods at two women standing on the other side of the room.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: Those two have their eyes on you.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN looks at the women.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: They have their eyes on you, cunt.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: Not my type.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: Not blonde enough?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME looks at BRONN.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: There you go.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: Maybe I’m not in the mood.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The girls approach Bronn.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: Fuck it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN stands and approaches the girls.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRONN: No need to call me ser just because I’m an anointed knight.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER sits down next to JAIME.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: I’m sure he would be.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: Edmure is back in a cell. Can’t go killing my son by law. It wouldn’t be right. Give the family a bad name.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER sips his wine.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: I’m a bit old for all that.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: No, but back in your day.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn’t it?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME nods.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: I’ve defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it’s mine. What do you call that? Victory.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: Yes, you’re a great conqueror.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you’re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn’t matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it’s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don’t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME stands and exits. WALDER watches him go.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	INT. RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI and QYBURN are standing over TOMMEN’s body. His body is covered in a veil.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Show me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN: Your Grace, there’s no need--
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: Show me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN uncovers TOMMEN’s body. CERSEI stares at it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN: What are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI: He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	A horse-drawn carriage moves down the road, then stops. SAM and GILLY emerge from behind it. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. They walk to a nearby hill look out over a lake. Oldtown stands across the lake. SAM and GILLY marvel at it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: THE CITADEL
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM and GILLY enter and walk to the front desk. A maester is sitting behind the desk, holding spectacles up to his eyes and reading.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM: Hello.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The maester keeps reading and then looks up at SAM, removing his spectacles.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM: From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM holds up a letter. The maester puts down his spectacles and opens his palm. SAM reaches across the table with the letter, offering it to the maester. The maester does not retrieve it. SAM presses himself against the desk, leans further in, and places the letter directly in the maester’s hand. The maester takes the letter, breaks the seal, and reads it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM: I’m-- I’m to be the new maester.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The maester looks at SAM and then opens a large book. He flips a few pages.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MAESTER: Oh.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The maester points his finger to a line of text on the open page.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MAESTER: According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM: He died.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MAESTER: We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM: Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He’s since passed away. Which is why I’m here.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MAESTER: This is irregular.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SAM: Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The maester stares blankly at SAM, then picks up a quill and crosses off two lines of text in the open book.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MAESTER: The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The maester stands and begins walking away. SAM and GILLY start to follow him. He turns back and looks at GILLY.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MAESTER:  No women or children!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The maester turns and walks away. SAM makes several baffled gestures to GILLY and then follows the maester. They enter a small hallway full of books. The maester stops in front of a dark side passage and gestures towards it. SAM starts down the passage. The maester leaves. On his way through, SAM touches several of the books lining the shelves. SAM emerges onto the other side of the passage. The passage opens onto an enormous library with a chandelier dangling from the ceiling that reflects light. SAM gets teary and smiles.

s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW is standing behind the high table, staring across the hall. MELISANDRE stands by his side.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW points to the other end of the hall.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW chuckles.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS enters the hall and tosses the charred stag statuette at MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE catches it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: What is that?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: The Princess Shireen.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: We burned her at the stake.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: Why?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: You burned a little girl alive!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: I only do what my Lord commands!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: I didn’t lie. I was wrong.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS and MELISANDRE stare at each other in silence.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS (to JON SNOW): I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW (to MELISANDRE): Do you have anything to say for yourself?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE: I’ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not. You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW approaches MELISANDRE.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE puts the stag statuette down on the high table and begins to walk away. DAVOS moves in her way.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAVOS: If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MELISANDRE moves past DAVOS and exits.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW stands atop the outer wall watching MELISANDRE ride south on her horse. SANSA appears.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: Mother and Father’s room? You should take it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: I’m not a Stark.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: You are to me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: He did.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: And you trust him?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I’m sorry.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW approaches SANSA.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW touches SANSA’s face and kisses her on the forehead, then turns to walk away.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: Jon.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW smiles and looks up at the sky.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: Well, Father always promised, didn’t he?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW exits. SANSA looks out at the wilderness.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ELLARIA SAND and OLENNA TYRELL are sitting across a table from each other. OBARA SAND, NYMERIA SAND, and TYENE SAND flank ELLARIA.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ELLARIA: You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OBARA: We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: What is your name again? Barbaro?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OBARA: Obara.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me what I need.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NYMERIA: Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: Do shut up, dear.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA looks at TYENE.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: Anything from you?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYENE opens her mouth to speak.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ELLARIA: The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ELLARIA: You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ELLARIA rings a bell.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	OLENNA: And what is my heart’s desire?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ELLARIA: Vengeance. Justice.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	VARYS emerges from a hallway.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	VARYS: Fire and blood.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS is sitting on a couch, sipping a glass of wine. DAARIO enters.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO pours himself a glass of wine.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: You’re not coming with us.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and stands in front of her.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO sets his glass of wine down on a table.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO sits down.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: Who are you marrying this time?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: I don’t know. Maybe no one.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: I can’t bring a lover to Westeros.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: A king wouldn’t think twice about it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and kneels in front of her.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS touches DAARIO’s face.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: I can’t.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: The dwarf told you to do this.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: No one tells me to do anything.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: Don’t get angry.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: Bay of Dragons?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO sips his wine.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO: I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what’s coming for them.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: Farewell, Daario Naharis.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAARIO nods and exits.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION is sitting off to the side of the room on a bench. DAENERYS enters, walking down the steps from the throne.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: How did he take it?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: No tears.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS reaches the bottom of the steps and approaches TYRION.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: It’s not.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS sits down on the bench next to TYRION.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: Yes, you really are.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS nods.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: Well, you have completely failed to console me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS stands and turns to face TYRION.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: For what it’s worth, I’ve been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone’s always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION stands on the bench.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: It’s your counsel I need.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION: It’s yours. Now and always.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS pins a Hand of the King’s brooch on TYRION’s chest.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	DAENERYS: Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TYRION holds back tears, then kneels.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER FREY is sitting at the high table, eating and drinking. The rest of the dining hall is empty. A handmaiden approaches and sets down a platter of pie on the table in front of him.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: You’re not one of mine, are you?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HANDMAIDEN: No, my lord.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: Didn’t think so. Too pretty.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER slaps the handmaiden on the buttocks and smiles.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HANDMAIDEN: They’re here, my lord.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HANDMAIDEN: But they’re already here, my lord.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER looks around the hall. The handmaiden points to the pie.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HANDMAIDEN: Here, my lord.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER pulls back the top layer of the pie. A finger protrudes from the center of the slice.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	HANDMAIDEN: They weren’t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER breathes heavily.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	WALDER: What…
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The handmaiden reaches up to her face and pulls it away, revealing her true identity is ARYA.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ARYA: My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ARYA brandishes a knife. WALDER gets up to run, but ARYA grabs him and pulls him back down. She grabs him by the forehead and slits his throat. He convulses and groans as he dies. ARYA smiles and stares at him.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA sits underneath the weirwood tree. PETYR approaches her.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PETYR: Forgive me, my lady… if you’re at prayer.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: I’m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA stands and walks towards PETYR.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: I was a stupid girl.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PETYR: You were a child.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: What do you want?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PETYR: I thought you knew what I wanted.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: I was wrong.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PETYR: No, you weren’t. Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PETYR leans in to kiss SANSA, but SANSA puts her hand on his chest to stop him.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: It’s a pretty picture.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA walks past PETYR.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PETYR: News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA: You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It’s never stopped you from serving yourself.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	PETYR: The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	SANSA exits.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN stares up at The Wall. BRAN and MEERA wait nearby.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN: This is where I leave you.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MEERA: You’re not coming with us?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN: The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN approaches his horse and lifts BRAN off of it. He carries BRAN to the foot of a nearby weirwood, then walks back to his horse.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MEERA: Where will you go?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN: The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I’ll do what I can… as long as I can.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN mounts his horse.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRAN: Thank you, Uncle Benjen.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN: I wish you both good fortune.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BENJEN rides away. BRAN looks at the weirwood and then starts to crawl towards it. MEERA helps him. BRAN reaches out to the weirwood but MEERA grabs his wrist.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MEERA: Are you sure you’re ready for this?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRAN:I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	BRAN touches the weirwood tree.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED stands at the base of the Tower of Joy. He heards LYANNA screaming in the Tower and rushes towards the stairs. BRAN stands on the ground behind him. NED turns back as though he hears a noise, but sees nothing. He hurries up the steps. BRAN follows. NED bursts through a door into a bedroom. LYANNA lies in bed. The sheets are soaked with blood. A handmaiden is standing in the corner.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: Ned?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED: Lyanna.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED rushes to LYANNA’s side.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: Is that you? Is that really you?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA lifts her hand. NED takes it.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: You’re not a dream.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED: No, I’m not a dream. I’m here. Right here.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: I’ve missed you, big brother.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED begins to cry.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED: I’ve missed you, too.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: I want to be brave.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED: Shh. You are.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: I’m not.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED lifts his hand from LYANNA’s stomach. His palm is covered in blood.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: I don’t want to die.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED: You’re not going to die.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED looks at the handmaiden.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED: Get her some water!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: No, no water.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED: Is there a maester?
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: Please. Listen to me, Ned.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA whispers in NED’s ear.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: If Robert finds out, he’ll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The handmaiden hands NED the child.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: Promise me, Ned. Promise me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	NED stares down at the baby. The baby opens its eyes. Zoom on the baby’s face.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	Slow zoom out from JON SNOW’s face. JON SNOW is sitting at high table. SANSA sits beside him. Representatives from Northern houses, the Vale, and the wildlings are gathered in the dining hall. TORMUND and DAVOS sit among the wildlings. PETYR stands off to the side, watching.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	VALE KNIGHT: You can’t expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	TORMUND: We didn’t invade. We were invited.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	VALE KNIGHT: Not by me.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	One of the houses’ representatives stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MAN: The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The men begin to murmur. LYANNA MORMONT stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	LYANNA: Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	The men resume murmuring. LORD MANDERLY stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MANDERLY: Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime. I didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	MANDERLY draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels. LORD GLOVER stands.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	GLOVER: I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW: There’s nothing to forgive, my lord.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	GLOVER: There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	GLOVER draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	GLOVER: The King in the North!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	Everyone in the hall stands and draws their blades.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ALL: The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JON SNOW stands. SANSA and PETYR look at each other.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME, BRONN, and several Lannister knights are riding on horseback on a high hill. They stop and look out at King’s Landing. JAIME sees smoke billowing out of the ruins of the Great Sept of Baelor.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME: Come on.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	JAIME rides on.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CUT TO: RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	CERSEI enters, escorted by GREGOR and the Kingsguard. The room is full of nobles and city soldiers. QYBURN stands next to the Iron Throne, holding a crown. CERSEI and GREGOR approach the throne. CERSEI stands in front of the throne. JAIME enters through a side passage and watches.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN: I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN places the crown on CERSEI’s head. CERSEI sits in the Iron Throne. She and JAIME look at each other.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	QYBURN: Long may she reign.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	ALL: Long may she reign.
s06e10	The Winds of Winter	THEON and YARA are standing on their ship. They look out at the sea. A vessel appears with a dragon as its ram. GREY WORM and the Unsullied are riding in it. Hundreds of other ships are sailing around them. Some of the ships carry the Dothraki and their horses. DROGON, VISERION, and RHAEGAL fly overhead. They fly over the boat leading the convoy DAENERYS, TYRION, VARYS, and MISSANDEI are riding in it. DAENERYS and TYRION look at each other, then DAENERYS looks out at the ocean ahead. The dragons screech.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys are all gathered in the hall. WALDER FREY sits at the high table. WALDER slams his cup down on the table twice. The room grows silent. WALDER stands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER FREY: You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys laugh.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER FREY: Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys cheer and slam their fists on their tables. WALDER snaps his fingers at a servant girl. The girl begins serving flasks of wine.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER FREY: I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys cheer. WALDER raises his glass.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDERY FREY: Stand together!
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys stand in unison.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ALL: Stand together!
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys drink. WALDER holds his cup to his lips but does not drink. The servant girl picks up her cup and motions to drink.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER: Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER addresses the hall again.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER: Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys cheer.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER: Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.
s07e01	Dragonstone	Some of the Freys groan.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER: No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys choke, cough, and spit up blood.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WALDER: Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Freys collapse and die. WALDER takes hold of his own face and removes it, revealing ARYA's face. ARYA turns to the servant girl.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA walks through the hall, staring at the Frey bodies. She smiles and exits.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The wind blows over the tundra. A dark cloud starts forming on the horizon, growing larger until it consumes everything. A white walker rides into view, accompanied by several other white walkers. The army of the dead files through the darkness. An undead giant walks into view. Zoom on the giant's eye.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRAN is lying in his sled. His eyes are pure white. They wash to their normal color. MEERA is standing in front of him, holding the ropes to the sled. The gate rises. DOLOROUS EDD walks through the gate, accompanied by several members of the Night's Watch.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EDD: You wildlings?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MEERA: I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EDD: How do I know that's true?
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRAN raises his head and stares at EDD.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRAN: You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EDD pauses and looks down, then looks to his men.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EDD: Okay, come on. Let's get them inside.
s07e01	Dragonstone	Two Night's Watch men sheathe their swords, approach BRAN's sled, grab the ropes, and pull him inside the gate. MEERA follows. EDD lingers and stares out into the wild, then turns on his heel and walks through the gate. The gate closes behind him.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON SNOW stands at the high table. SANSA and DAVOS sit at his sides. BRIENNE, PODRIC, TORMUND, PETYR BAELISH, YOHN ROYCE, LYANNA MORMONT, ROBETT GLOVER, and the lords of the northern houses are in attendance.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ROBETT: It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The northern lords laugh.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Not just the boys.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE looks at JON.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ROBETT stands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ROBETT: You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
s07e01	Dragonstone	LYANNA stands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	LYANNA: I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ROBETT: Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--
s07e01	Dragonstone	LYANNA: And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
s07e01	Dragonstone	DAVOS smiles. LYANNA turns to JON.
s07e01	Dragonstone	LYANNA: We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men pound their tables and shout in agreement. ROBETT nods at LYANNA. ROBETT and LYANNA sit.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON looks at TORMUND. TORMUND turns and looks at JON.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: But if we're going to survive this winter together...
s07e01	Dragonstone	TORMUND grunts and stands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	TORMUND: You want us to man the castles for you?
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men murmur.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
s07e01	Dragonstone	TORMUND: Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
s07e01	Dragonstone	TORMUND sits.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.
s07e01	Dragonstone	YOHN stands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	YOHN: The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ALL: Aye!
s07e01	Dragonstone	YOHN sits.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: And then they broke faith.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
s07e01	Dragonstone	The hall goes silent.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men chatter and pound the tables.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword," and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON stares at SANSA. SANSA looks away. JON addresses the hall.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Ned Umber.
s07e01	Dragonstone	NED UMBER, a boy, stands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Alys Karstark.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ALYS KARSTARK, a young woman, stands. NED and ALYS approach the high table.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.
s07e01	Dragonstone	NED and ALYS unsheathe their swords and kneel.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Stand.
s07e01	Dragonstone	NED and ALYS stand.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?
s07e01	Dragonstone	NED & ALYS: Now and always!
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men cheer and pound the tables.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - WALKWAY
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON walks briskly along the walkway. SANSA follows him.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: You are my sister, but I am king now.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: Will you start wearing a crown?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: So I can't question your decisions anymore?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Of course you can, but--
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON stops walking. SANSA walks past him, then stops and turns to face him.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Do you think I'm Joffrey?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Thank you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON stares out at the yard below.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: You're good at this, you know.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: At what?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: At ruling.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON sighs.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: No.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON chuckles.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: Why are you laughing?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON continues walking. SANSA follows.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: What did father used to say? Everything before the word "but" is horse shit.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: He never said that to me.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: I'm not trying to undermine you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA grabs JON's arm and spins him to face her.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: Would that be so terrible?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAESTER WOLKAN approaches.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WOLKAN: A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.
s07e01	Dragonstone	WOLKAN hands a bound note to JON, then bows and leaves. JON unravels the note.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: "Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: What does she want?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JON: You almost sound as if you admire her.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: I learned a great deal from her.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI walks atop a mural of Westeros painted on the floor. The painter is completing it. JAIME enters and walks towards CERSEI, then looks at the mural and nods at the painter. The painter puts down his brush and exits.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: What is this?
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: It's ours now, we just have to take it.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI turns to face JAIME.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: No, not angry.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Are you afraid of me?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Should I be?
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Dragonstone.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME approaches the depiction of Dragonstone in the mural and stands over it.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Enemies to the east.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI walks towards Dorne on the mural.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI walks towards Highgarden on the mural.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEi walks towards the North on the mural.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: A dynasty for us, then.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: We never talked about Tommen.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEi turns and walks to a nearby table and pours herself a glass of wine.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: There's nothing to say.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Our baby boy killed himself.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Cersei--
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY
s07e01	Dragonstone	Ships bearing the kraken sigil of House Greyjoy are sailing into port. CERSEI and JAIME watch the boats from the shore, escorted by GREGOR CLEGANE and several other guards.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Not all of them.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Well, it looks like all of them.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: Oh, what did he come here for, then?
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: A queen.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI exits, followed by GREGOR and the guards.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, flanked by JAIME and GREGOR. EURON GREYJOY stands at the foot of the throne. Guards line the hall.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON points at CERSEI.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON starts walking up towards the throne. GREGOR takes a step towards him. EURON stops walking and looks up at him.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON smiles and walks backwards off the steps. GREGOR returns to his previous position.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JAIME: And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: If not the most humble.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: What do you want in return?
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON raises his arms. JAIME's face twists.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: I decline your proposal.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: Why?
s07e01	Dragonstone	CERSEI: You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: You should try it. Feels wonderful.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON chuckles. JAIME looks at CERSEI.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON: I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	EURON turns and exits the Great Hall.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAMWELL TARLY places books on the shelves.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL BEDROOM
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM retrieves a bedpan from beneath one of the beds. He gags.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL TOILET
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM opens the lid of the toilet. He coughs, empties a bedpan, then cleans out a bedpan.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM is carry a stack of books. A maester walks by and places another book on top of the pile as he passes. SAM grunts and sighs.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL CAFETERIA
s07e01	Dragonstone	A number of maesters are gathered for a meal. SAM pours soup into their bowls.

s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM places books on the shelves. A maester places a book on top of the pile he's carrying. He puts more books on the shelves.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL INFIRMARY/CAFETERIA/TOILET
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM continues his duties.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM wipes his brow. He stares at the gate, then looks over his shoulder, then back at the gate. He walks over to the gate, takes hold of the bars, and looks through. The gate rattles. He focuses on an open book. He hears a chain rattling, hurries to a bookshelf,
s07e01	Dragonstone	and pretends to be placing a book on it. A maester comes around the corner, walks down past him to the gate, unlocks it, enters, and locks it behind him. SAM watches him.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARCHMAESTER MARWYN is performing an autopsy. SAM stands on the other side of the table, watching.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN removes the liver and hands it to SAM.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: Weigh that.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM walks over to the scales.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankind's curse.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM puts the liver on one side of the scale and places weights on the other side.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: Archmaester, I was wondering...
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: What's the weight?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: Um, 147.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN walks over to an open ledger, picks up a quill, and writes the number 147.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: I don't remember your proposition.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: No.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: Not a very strong proposition, is it?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN hands SAM the heart. SAM takes it to the scales.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: Sources in the restricted area?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: So, you believe me.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. "How will we survive?" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--"The end is near! How will we survive?" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN closes the ledger.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN: Be a good lad. Clean this up.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MARWYN exits. SAM stares at the body.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL BEDROOM
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM rolls in a cart of clean bedpans. He walks over to a sleeping maester and grabs a ring of keys fro his bedside table.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM opens the gate, steps through, and closes it behind him.
s07e01	Dragonstone	He grabs several books and stuffs them in a satchel.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE and PODRIC are sparring. POD missteps and BRIENNE hits him on the back with her sword. He grunts.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE: Nope.
s07e01	Dragonstone	They reset. POD advances and they exchange several sword blows but POD missteps again and BRIENNE tags him on the behind. POD grunts.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE: Nope.
s07e01	Dragonstone	TORMUND approaches and stares at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks at him. POD catches her off guard and tags her shoulder with his blade. She punches him in his gut and tosses him in the snow. TORMUND looks at POD.
s07e01	Dragonstone	TORMUND: You're a lucky man.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR BAELISH and SANSA stand on a walkway above the courtyard, watching BRIENNE and POD.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR:  I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: What do you want, Lord Baelish?
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR: I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR: What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: At the moment, peace and quiet.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE walks up the stairs. PETYR motions to speak.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR looks at BRIENNE.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR: My lady.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR looks at SANSA.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR: My lady.
s07e01	Dragonstone	PETYR walks down the steps and into the courtyard.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE: Why is he still here?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA sighs.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE nods and watches PETYR walk across the courtyard.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BRIENNE: He wants something.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANSA: I know exactly what he wants.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA is riding a horse through the forest. She happens upon a group of Lannister soldiers sitting by a fire.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN (singing): He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA's horse neighs. The men turn to look at her. One stands.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN: It's a new one.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: I don't want to steal your food.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA dismounts her horse, leads it nearer to the fire, and ties it reigns off on a tree. She approaches the camp.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: You heading south?
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: King's Landing.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: Poor girl.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men chuckle.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: Not so bad, is it?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men chuckle.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN: Worst place in the world.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: What are you doing in the Riverlands?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: Here you go. Guests first.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2 passes ARYA a cooked rabbit.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA pulls some meat of the rabbit's bone and eats it.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men laugh.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: My wife's just had our first baby.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: Boy or girl?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men laugh.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: I hope it's a girl.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: Why?
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: Are you old enough to drink?
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA nods. MAN #2 passes a skin of wine to ARYA. She uncorks it and drinks.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #2: It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: It's really good.
s07e01	Dragonstone	MAN #3: So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA drinks.
s07e01	Dragonstone	ARYA: I'm going to kill the queen.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The men fall silent, then everyone laughs.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - FARM
s07e01	Dragonstone	The farm is covered in snow and the wind howls. SANDOR CLEGANE, THOROS OF MYR, BERIC DONDARRION, and several other members of the Brotherhood Without Banners ride into view.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: Bad night to be outdoors.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? "It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS holds out a skin of rum to SANDOR.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: Why are you always in such a foul mood?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Experience.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The horses all stop.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: This seems like a good place to spend the night.
s07e01	Dragonstone	They all stare at a nearby farmhouse.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: These people don't want us here.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC urges his horse onward. The others follow.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: I don't like the look of it.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS dismounts his horse.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: For a big, hard man, you scare easy.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: I'll tell you what doesn't scare me: bald cocksuckers like you. You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot? Bald cunt.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS smiles.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: They don't.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)
s07e01	Dragonstone	Some of the Brothers enter the farmhouse, followed by THOROS.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The Brothers rummage around the farmhouse. SANDOR enters.
s07e01	Dragonstone	He stares at two skeletons in the corner, one adult-sized and the other child-sized. BERIC enters, sees the skeletons, and walks up beside SANDOR.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: How do you think it ended for them?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: With death.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Doesn't matter now.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: No, doesn't matter now.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR sits at the table. BERIC joins him. SANDOR bites into a hunk of bread. THOROS starts a fire in the fireplace.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC chuckles.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: But there's nothing special about you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: You're right about that.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: And?
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Your Lord.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: Clegane.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR looks at THOROS, who is kneeling by the fire.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR stands and walks closer to the fire.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: What do you want?
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: Look into the flames.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: I don't want to look in the damn flames.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR approaches the fire and looks into it.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: What do you see?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Logs burning.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: Keep looking. What do you see?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR's face twists.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: What else?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
s07e01	Dragonstone	The fire crackles.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC stands and approaches the fire.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Thousands of them.
s07e01	Dragonstone	BERIC: Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)
s07e01	Dragonstone	Thoros wakes to the sound of shoveling. He picks up his sword and a lantern and exits the farmhouse. SANDOR is outside digging a grave.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: What the hell are you doing, Clegane?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR plants his shovel in the ground.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Burying the dead.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR walks over to the body of the child, lifts it up, kneels down, and places it in the hole.
s07e01	Dragonstone	THOROS: You knew these people.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: Not really.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR stands, walks over to the body of the adult, lifts it up, kneels down, and places it in the hole. Then he stands and starts shoveling dirt into the hole. THOROS plants his sword in the ground and puts down his lantern, then picks up a shovel and begins helping SANDOR bury the bodies. When they're finished,
s07e01	Dragonstone	they stand over the grave.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SANDOR tosses down his shovel and exits. THOROS watches him leave.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM is sitting at the table, reading. GILLY is in the corner with LITTLE SAM. She holds a doll up to him. He reacts and she laughs.
s07e01	Dragonstone	LITTLE SAM: Mom.
s07e01	Dragonstone	GILLY turns to SAM.
s07e01	Dragonstone	GILLY: You should really sleep, Sam.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: The dead don't.
s07e01	Dragonstone	GILLY stands, carries a book over to the table, and sits.
s07e01	Dragonstone	GILLY: "Legends of the Long Night."
s07e01	Dragonstone	GILLY opens the book.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM sighs and turns the page. There is a diagram of a knife on the page. He turns the page again. There is a map on the page. SAM looks more closely at the map.
s07e01	Dragonstone	GILLY: What is it?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM points to a section of the map depicting a cave surrounded by a black mass.
s07e01	Dragonstone	GILLY: That's dragonglass?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM grabs a quill and begins writing.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL QUARANTINE CELLS
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM wheels a cart along the hall. He removes a bowl from a folded-out plank in the door beside him and folds the plank back up. He puts the bowl on the cart and pushes it further down the hall. He approaches the next door, picks up the bowl, and folds in the plank. A man can be heard vomiting and coughing inside. SAM puts the bowl on the cart and pushes it further down the hall. He approaches the next door and reaches for the bowl, but a hand lurches out from the hole in the door and grabs the bowl. SAM jumps backwards and gasps. The arm of the person behind the door is covered in grayscale, revealing it belongs to JORAH MORMONT. JORAH drops the bowl on the floor.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JORAH: Has she come yet?
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: Who?
s07e01	Dragonstone	JORAH: The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
s07e01	Dragonstone	SAM: Haven't heard anything.
s07e01	Dragonstone	JORAH pulls his hand back inside the cell. SAM approaches and folds up the plank.
s07e01	Dragonstone	DAENERYS TARGARYEN, TYRION LANNISTER, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are in a rowboat, looking out at the castle as they approach. A number of ships are anchored in the water behind them. DROGON, RHAEGAL, and VISERION fly overhead.
s07e01	Dragonstone	CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - BEACH
s07e01	Dragonstone	Everyone gets out of the rowboat. DAENERYS walks on ahead. She kneels down and presses her palm to the sand, then stares up at the castle and walks further down the beach. The others follow. They climb the steps and approach a gate flanked by two statues of dragon heads. Two Unsullied approach the gate and push it open, revealing a walkway up to the castle. DAENERYS, TYRION, MISSANDEI, GREY WORM, and VARYS walk through the gates and up the walkway. They enter the foyer. A tapestry bearing the stag sigil of House Baratheon is hanging off to the side. DAENERYS approaches it and tears it down. DAENERYS approaches a set of doors. Two Unsullied open them for her. She enters the throne room, followed by the others. VARYS and MISSANDEI stop following her. GREY WORM starts to continue onward but MISSANDEI puts her hand on his chest to stop him. DAENERYS approaches the throne and stares at it. TYRION looks around the hall. DAENERYS ascends the steps but walks past the throne into the Chamber of the Painted Table. TYRION follows. DAENERYS walks alongside the table and runs her fingers across it. TYRION walks alongside the table opposite her and stares at the dragon carvings on the wall. DAENERYS stands at the head of the table and stares down at the map of Westeros. TYRION looks at her.
s07e01	Dragonstone	DAENERYS: Shall we begin?
s07e01	Dragonstone	From HBO:
s07e01	Dragonstone	Jon Snow organizes the defense of the North. Cersei tries to even the odds. Samwell discovers crucial information. Daenerys comes home.
s07e02	Stormborn	A storm rages. Rain falls on the beach and the castle, lightning flashes, and thunder crackles overhead. DAENERYS TARGARYEN, TYRION LANNISTER, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and VARYS are standing in the Chamber of the Painted Table, staring out at the storm.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION: On a night like this, you came into the world.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: I wish I could remember it.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS turns away from the window and walks over to the table.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION: We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: Good.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS looks at the figurines placed on the table
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: Not so many lions.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS picks up a dragon figurine from the table.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION: Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: No.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS puts down the dragon figurine.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION: We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS looks at VARYS.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: I never properly thanked you for that.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: I did.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: And then you served the man who overthrew him?
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION: Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS (to VARYS): Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: Which you turned to your advantage.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: Who gave the order to kill me?
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: King Robert.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: Who hired the assassins?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: To keep yourself alive.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION: Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: I swear it, my queen.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS: And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS smiles.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS: I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM: Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE is standing alone in the throne room. DAENERYS enters, accompanied by TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM. They approach MELISANDRE.
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian.
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE:  Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded.  It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE:  I am called Melisandre.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS begins speaking English.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS:  She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE:  No, it didn't.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS turns to look at Varys.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS bows his head to DAENERYS.  DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros, does he?
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISDANDRE:  Not yet.   But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  What does your Lord expect from me?
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian again.
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE:  The Long Night is coming.  Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS speaking in English.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  No, but I like it better.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE:  Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a role to play, as does another.  The King in the North, Jon Snow.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  You know him?
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
s07e02	Stormborn	VARYS:  And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE:  As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger.  As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  He sounds like quite a man.
s07e02	Stormborn	MELISANDRE:  Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.
s07e02	Stormborn	DARNERYS smiles at Tyrion.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS pauses for a moment.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s07e02	Stormborn	Young boys and girls are practicing archery.  JON, SANSA and DAVOS stand on the upper level watching the training.
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  Do you think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  Read the last bit.
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."  What does that mean?
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  "The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."
s07e02	Stormborn	DAVOS:  Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAVOS pauses to ponder something.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  What?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAVOS:  Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAVOS:  No, too dangerous.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  But?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAVOS:  But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?
s07e02	Stormborn	JON gazes back to the courtyard looking concerned.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO: RED KEEP - THRONEROOM
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne.  She is surrounded by JAIME, QYBURN, THE MOUNTAIN and members of her Queensguard.  Many lords are in attendance including RANDYLL TARLEY.
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI:  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords begin murmuring amongst themselves.
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI:  You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords murmur louder
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI:  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL TARLEY slowly approaches the throne.
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL:  She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI glances over to QYBURN.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN:  We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord.
s07e02	Stormborn	The meeting disbands.  All the lords walk out into the hall outside of the throne room.  JAIME approaches RANDYLL TARLEY and begins to walk with him.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  Lord Tarley.
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL:  Ser, Jaime.  I believe you know my son.
s07e02	Stormborn	DICKON:  Ser, Jaime.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  Rickon, isn't it?
s07e02	Stormborn	DICKON:  Dickon.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  That's it.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME walks past Dickon and begins a discussion with Randyll
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL:  If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME and RANDYLL walk to an unoccupied hallway and continue their conversation.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  Do you ride for Hornhill today?
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL:  I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL:  It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL:  Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL:  I've known Olenna since I was a child.
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?
s07e02	Stormborn	RANDYLL nods his head in agreement
s07e02	Stormborn	JAIME:  When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS
s07e02	Stormborn	ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL and JORAH are standing together in the quarantine room.  JORAH's upper body is covered in Greyscale except his face.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH:  How long?
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10, could be 20.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH:  But how long 'till...
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH sighs and sits down on his bed.  SAMWELL approaches MARWYN.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL: Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Does this look like a baby to you?
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN turns to face JORAH.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH nods his head.  MARWYN turns to leave the room and begins walking to the door.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Come, Samwell.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Should we send word to your family, Ser...
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH:  Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Mormont?
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH:  There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN is waiting for SAMWELL in the hallway
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Come, Samwell.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room.  He closes the door to the quarantine room.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN and CERSEI are walking along the torch lit dungeon passing the dragon skulls.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN:  Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI:  No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN:  Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI:  They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN and CERSEI arrive at the end of the dungeon.  They are looking at the largest dragon skull in the room.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN:  Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN turns and starts walking away from the dragon skull.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN:  Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN walks up to a machine covered by a cloth.  He reaches up and removes the cloth revealing an artillery-sized crossbow aimed at Balerion's skull.
s07e02	Stormborn	QYBURN:  The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever.
s07e02	Stormborn	CERSEI releases a lever on the machine and launches a giant bolt directly into Balerion's eye socket.  The bolt buries deep into the skull and gets stuck.  CERSEI stands behind the machine smirking.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS, YARA GREYJOY, THEON GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND, OLENNA TYRELL, VARYS, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and TYRION LANNISTER are standing around a carved table of Westeros having a discussion.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA looks at TYRION with disgust.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:    I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS pauses for a moment.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
s07e02	Stormborn	OLENNA addresses DAENERYS from across the table.
s07e02	Stormborn	OLENNA:  That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	OLEANNA:  Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION begins walking around the carved table of Westeros.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLIA:  And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  You are.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION reaches down and picks up a figurine that resembles a Kraken in a longship.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION walks to the south of the map and picks up a figurine that resembles a sun.  He takes both figurines and places them at King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
s07e02	Stormborn	OLENNA:  So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION reaches down and picks up the figurine resembling an Unsullied helmet.  He begins walking back around the map of Westeros.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION:  The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYRION stops in front of Casterly Rock.  There is a figurine that resembles a lion.  He knocks the lion over with the Unsullied figurine.  Everyone in the room nods in agreement.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  Do I have your support?
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  You have mine.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLIA:  Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
s07e02	Stormborn	Lady Olenna nods her head in agreement.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?
s07e02	Stormborn	Everyone except DAENERYS and OLENNA leave the Chamber of the Painted Table.  DAENERYS walks to the end and sits next to OLENNA.
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS:  I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
s07e02	Stormborn	OLENNA:  Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?
s07e02	Stormborn	DAENERYS nods her hod in agreement
s07e02	Stormborn	OLENNA:  He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO - DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM is sitting sharpening his sword.  Someone knocks on his door.  He begins speaking Valyrian.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:   Enter.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI walks in.  She speaks in English.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  I will see you when I return.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  But you don't know when that will be.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREYWORM:  No one knows.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  I wish you good fortune.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI turns and starts to walk out of the room.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  Missandei --
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI stops and turns back towards GREY WORM.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  Why?
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  You know why.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  I don't.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  You are my weakness.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI appears offended.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  That's what I am?  Your weakness?
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  I believe it.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  I do too.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM steps forward and kisses MISSANDEI.  MISSANDEI grabs his hands and stops him.  She begins to undress herself.  MISSANDEI steps forward and begins to undress GREY WORM.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM:  No.
s07e02	Stormborn	MISSANDEI:  I want to see you.  Please.
s07e02	Stormborn	GREY WORM hesitates for a moment, then nods his head in agreement.  MISSANDEI finishes undressing GREY WORM.  Sex scene ensues.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO - CITADEL LIBRARY
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN and SAMWELL are walking by various shelves in the library.  SAMWELL is carrying a stack of books for MARWYN.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Archmaester, I wanted to --
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  And this one.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN places another book on the stack SAMWELL is carrying.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN continues walking
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  I wanted to ask you --
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL says nothing.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN: What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Possibly something a bit more poetic?
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  We're not poets, Tarley.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  This is your moment.  Use it wisely.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN begins looking through books on the shelf.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN places a book on SAMWELL's stack.  He continues looking at more books.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Oh, you are?
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN places another book on SAMWELL's stack.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Oh.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN:  The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
s07e02	Stormborn	MARWYN turns and walks out of the library.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO: QUARANTINE ROOMS
s07e02	Stormborn	A few hours have passed.  JORAH is writing a letter to DAENERYS by candlelight in his quarantine room.  He hears a noise in the hallway and stands to face the door.  SAMWELL opens the door and rolls in a cart filled with medical tools and containers.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Hello.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH:  What are you doing?
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL picks up a roll of leather and sets it on the table.  He unrolls it revealing an assortment of scalpels and knives.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today, Ser Jorah.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL picks up a large flask and hands it to JORAH.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Drink this.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH:  What is it?
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Rum.  Drink it all, please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH reaches for the bottle.  SAMWELL grabs it back and drinks some himself before handing it back to JORAH.  JORAH drains the flask.  SAMWELL picks up a thick book from the medical cart and sets it on the table.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  If you could take off your shirt.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL gives JORAH a strap made of leather.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished.
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH:  Have you ever done this before?
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  No.  No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --
s07e02	Stormborn	JORAH looks at SAMWELL to stop him from explaining.  SAMWELL picks up a pair of tweezers and a scalpel.  He grabs a section of Greyscale to cut it off.  JORAH recoils in pain.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL:  Shh,  shhh.  Again, I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream.
s07e02	Stormborn	SAMWELL cuts into the Greyscale.  JORAH begins to writhe in agony and whimper.  Pus is dripping from the wound.  SAMWELL continues cutting and slices a layer of Greyscale off JORAH's skin.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  INN AT THE CROSSROADS
s07e02	Stormborn	Two men are at a table having a conversation.
s07e02	Stormborn	MAN #1:  They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
s07e02	Stormborn	MAN #2:  Horse shit.  Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
s07e02	Stormborn	MAN #1:  If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple.
s07e02	Stormborn	The camera zooms out showing Arya eavesdropping on the men.
s07e02	Stormborn	MAN #2:  As long as we get back there before they start.
s07e02	Stormborn	MAN #1:  One more round.  It's a long ride.
s07e02	Stormborn	A waiter approaches Arya's table.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  Ary!
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?
s07e02	Stormborn	Arya reaches over and grabs a potpie from the tray and starts eating it.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Mmm.  This is good.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:    You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  I didn't do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  You've been making pies?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  One or two.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Big lady?
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  She found me.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  What happened to you Ary?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA pauses and doesn't answer HOT PIE.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  You got any ale?
s07e02	Stormborn	Hot Pie starts to reach for a pitcher on the tray.  Arya reaches over and grabs it before him, pouring herself a cup.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  Where are you heading?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  King's Landing.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  Why?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  I heard Cersei's queen now.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Hmm.
s07e02	Stormborn	Arya nods in agreement.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  I can't believe someone could do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Cersei would do that.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  No.  The Boltons are dead.
s07e02	Stormborn	Arya stops eating and drops her food.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  What?
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  You're lying.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA starts picking up her things to leave.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Thanks for the pie.
s07e02	Stormborn	Arya reaches to her side and produces a bag of gold.  She starts to open the pouch.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Thanks.
s07e02	Stormborn	Arya stands and walks past Hot Pie.  She turns and puts her hand on his shoulder.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed.
s07e02	Stormborn	HOT PIE:  No, I won't.  I'm like you, Ary.  I'm a survivor.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA turns and exits the Inn
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  EXT. INN AT THE CROSSROADS
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA climbs on her horse.  She looks towards the south, then the north.  She makes a decision and turns around to head back north.  She rides off into the distance.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS
s07e02	Stormborn	JON is bent over his desk looking at maps.  There's a knock at the door.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  Come in.
s07e02	Stormborn	WOLKAN:  A raven, My King, from the Citadel.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON begins reading the scroll.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL
s07e02	Stormborn	The room is filled with northern lords and ladies including SANSA, JON, BRIENNE, LYANNA MORMONT, ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE, and PETER BAELISH.  JON is standing in the great hall holding a message up for the lords to see.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords murmur amongst themselves.  JON hands the first note to ROBETT GLOVER.  JON holds up a different note for the lords to see.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords murmur louder.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords speak among themselves and look concerned.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
s07e02	Stormborn	There is a negative outcry from the lords gathered in the hall
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords nod in agreement
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  I know that.
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man.
s07e02	Stormborn	YOHN ROYCE stands up and turns to face JON.
s07e02	Stormborn	YOHN ROYCE:  Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords shout in agreement.
s07e02	Stormborn	ROBETT GLOVER:  We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom.
s07e02	Stormborn	LYANNA MORMONT:  Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north.
s07e02	Stormborn	The lords pound the tables in agreement.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it.
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  I'm leaving both in good hands.
s07e02	Stormborn	SANSA:  Whose?
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT
s07e02	Stormborn	JON stands in the torchlit crypt looking at a statue of Ned Stark.  LORD BAELISH approaches him.
s07e02	Stormborn	BAELISH:  I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
s07e02	Stormborn	Baelish looks up at the statue of Ned Stark.
s07e02	Stormborn	BAELISH:  I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON turns to face BAELISH.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  You don't belong down here.
s07e02	Stormborn	BAELISH:  Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  I have nothing to say to you.
s07e02	Stormborn	BAELISH:  Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON grabs BAELISH by the throat and pushes him against the wall.  BAELISH begins choking.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON:  Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
s07e02	Stormborn	JON releases BAELISH.  JON turns and walks to exit the crypt.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s07e02	Stormborn	JON walks into the courtyard towards his horse.  SER DAVOS is seated on his own horse awaiting him.  JON climbs onto his horse and looks back.  He sees SANSA on the upper level of the courtyard.  JON waves goodbye and SANSA waves back.  JON, DAVOS and Winterfell guards ride out of the gate and exit the courtyard.  BAELISH exits from the crypt looking shaken.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  RIVERLANDS
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA is building a fire.  Her horse is tied to a tree.  The horse begins to whinny.  ARYA stands and grabs her sword from beside the fire.  Multiple wolves come from the woods and begin to circle her.  A large grey and white dire wolf approaches her barring teeth.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Nymeria?
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA sets her sword down and begins to approach the dire wolf.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Nymeria, it's me, Arya.  I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA stretches her hand out towards the dire wolf.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  Come with me.
s07e02	Stormborn	The dire wolf turns and begins to leave.  All the other wolves walk away with it.  ARYA whispers to herself.
s07e02	Stormborn	ARYA:  That's not you.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE
s07e02	Stormborn	It's nighttime.  There are dozens of ships sailing on the Sea of Dorne.

s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA SAND's daughters TYENE, OBARA, and NYMERIA are laying in hammocks next to each other having a conversation.
s07e02	Stormborn	NYMERIA:  You can't have them all.  It's not fair.
s07e02	Stormborn	OBARA:  I'm oldest.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYENE:  Momma will want Cersei for herself.
s07e02	Stormborn	OBARA:  She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.
s07e02	Stormborn	NYMERIA:  The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYENE: Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.
s07e02	Stormborn	OBARA:  Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma, momma.
s07e02	Stormborn	OBARA begins mocking TYENE.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYENE:  Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
s07e02	Stormborn	OBARA and NYMERIA mock TYENE in unison.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND are seated at a table drinking together.  THEON GREYJOY is standing next to them.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  A few times.  Never stayed long.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:   A boy in every port?
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  Could we get some more?
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA hands her empty cup back to THEON.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  I thought it wasn't for you.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  I'm developing a taste for it.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA looks at THEON
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  He's not your servant.
s07e02	Stormborn	THEON:  It's fine.
s07e02	Stormborn	THEON begins filling the cup from a barrel of wine.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  Once I kill my uncle.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  And what will you be, handsome?
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA stands and gropes THEON.
s07e02	Stormborn	THEON:  Whatever my queen demands.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  He'll be my advisor, my protector.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  Oh, I see.  Your protector.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA slowly walks towards YARA.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  So if someone gets too close to you --
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  He might have to intervene.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  -- hold that person back.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  Until they've made their intentions known.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA sits next to YARA and spreads her legs apart, then looks at THEON.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.
s07e02	Stormborn	A large crash is heard and the ship rocks back and forth.  YARA turns to ELLARIA.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  Stay here.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA stands, picks up her sword and rushes for the stairs to the upper deck.  THEON follows her.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO: SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA climbs onto the deck and sees mayhem.  There are flaming arrows and flares in the sky.  YARA turns to survey the madness.  A ship bearing the Greyjoy sigil comes sailing out of the smoke and fog directly at YARA's ship.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  Euron.
s07e02	Stormborn	EURON'S ship crashes into YARA's.  An armored gang plank is dropped onto YARA's ship.  Euron Greyjoy is riding on top of the plank as it crashes onto YARA's ship.  A sailor is crushed in the process.  Euron boards YARA's boat and begins cutting men down with an ax and laughing maniacally.  Dozens of men are rushing behind him to board YARA'S ship.  YARA and THEON both yell and leap into battle.  Many people are killed instantly.  More men are running over the gang plank.  TYENE SAND comes from below deck.  She throws a dagger and lodges it in an invader's eye.  She moves to the body to retrieve her knife.  YARA approaches her and kneels beside her.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA:  Your mother is below deck.  Keep her safe.
s07e02	Stormborn	TYENE nods in agreement.  She stands up and heads down into the captain's quarters.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
s07e02	Stormborn	TYENE walks down the stairs and sees her mother, ELLARIA SAND.  TYENE runs to her mother and hugs her.  Immediately three men climb down the stairs and surround the women.  TYENE begins striking at the invaders with her knife.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP
s07e02	Stormborn	THEON is fighting several men with his sword.  He cuts down two men and looks at YARA.  YARA looks around her at the scene.  Severel ships are engulfed in flames.  Flaming arrows are streaking in and men are shouting.  A flaming bolt flies through the air and hits YARA's mast causing it to burst into flames.  More men are rushing from EURON'S boat onto the deck.  YARA is slowly walking and watching the scene unfold.  She then turns and continues fighting.  EURON is cutting through men with ease.  He has just killed another when a whip lashes around his throat.  NYMERIA pulls on the whip and brings EURON towards her.  Euron turns and punches her in the face.  OBARA comes from behind EURON and stabs him in his arm.  He is knocked to the ground but quickly regains his feet.  They continue fighting
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
s07e02	Stormborn	TYENE is still fighting the men.  She slices one man and stabs another in the testicles.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP
s07e02	Stormborn	OBARA attempts to attack EURON again.  He blocks her attack and disarms her spear.  EURON grabs her by the throat and headbutts her then pushes her to her knees.  He rams her spear through her stomach and lifts her off the ground.  NYMERIA turns and sees her sister and screams, running at EURON.  She whips him several times but EURON graps the end of the whip and pulls NYMERIA towards him.  She is attacking with a knife.  EURON punches her and knocks her down.  EURON then takes NYMERIA'S whip and wraps it around her throat choking her.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
s07e02	Stormborn	TYENE is now getting overpowered by the men.  They punch her and grab her from behind.  One of the men walks to ELLARIA and grabs her.
s07e02	Stormborn	ELLARIA:  Kill us!  Get it over with!
s07e02	Stormborn	The man in charge smirks at ELLARIA and shakes his head.  The men begin to push ELLARIA and TYENE upstairs to take them as hostages.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP
s07e02	Stormborn	Nearly every ship in YARA's fleet is burning.  There are flaming bolts in the sky.  YARA spots EURON below her.  She jumps from the upper deck and knocks EURON down.  He gets back up.
s07e02	Stormborn	EURON:  Give your uncle a kiss.
s07e02	Stormborn	YARA quickly steps forward and slaps EURON.  They begin fighting.  YARA is being overpowered by EURON.
s07e02	Stormborn	EURON:  Theon!
s07e02	Stormborn	THEON is still fighting.  He hears his uncle's yell and turns to look.  EURON is holding YARA and has his ax to her neck.  THEON stops and is frozen in place.  EURON begins smirking at him.
s07e02	Stormborn	EURON:  Ah, come on your cockless hound.  I have her.  Come and get her.
s07e02	Stormborn	THEON is looking around.  Men are being killed and everything is on fire.  One invader is pulling someone's teeth out.  THEON begins to shake and whimper.  His eye twitches.  He turns, drops his sword and jumps off of the rail of the ship into the water.  EURON begins to laugh and look at YARA.
s07e02	Stormborn	CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE
s07e02	Stormborn	THEON is in the water holding onto some flotsam.  He is watching the ships burn and the Iron Fleet sail away into the distance.

s07e04	The Spoils of War	The road leading from Highgarden is filled with men and carriages.  Lannister soldiers are marching back to King's Landing after sacking the castle.  JAIME yells out to a passing wagon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Halt that wagon!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME opens the carriage.  It is filled with gold bars and coins.  He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  You just won the biggest prize in the world.  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on.  You can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  There is no more High Septon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  No, there isn't, is there?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  There is still the question of my prize.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold.  He stops and turns to BRONN.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  That's a lot of money I just gave you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  It's not a castle.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN turns and points to Highgarden.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  How about that one?  It's available.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  You don't want Highgarden.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  I beg to differ.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you own, the more it weighs you down.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Right.  Just not to me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Stranger things have happened.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Like what?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback.  RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL:  The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  The current harvest?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON:  We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME looks over to BRONN.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  I'm not much for shoveling weight.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL:  My Lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON:  My Lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL, DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance.  Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CERSEI and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYCHO:  I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CERSEI:  You're too kind, My Lord.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYCHO:  I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace.  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.  The gold --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CERSEI:  Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYCHO:  Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CERSEI:  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYCHO:  Yes.  Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CERSEI:  My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYCHO:  I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine that it would require outside investment?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CERSEI:  It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYCHO:  I know them well.  They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CERSEI:  That's good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYCHO:  Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN is sitting in a wheelchair.  PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him.  BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN.  It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH:  This is for you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH:  The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH:  The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.  I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.  But I am here for her now.  To do what she would have done, to protect her children.  Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Do you know who this belonged to?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH:  No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN.  BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH:  To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Chaos is a ladder.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN is staring at BAELISH.  BAELISH stops speaking.  The door opens and Meera appears.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH:  I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH stands up to leave.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  I'm not Lord Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BAELISH bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA:  What's that?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA:  It's a very good idea.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  You're leaving?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA:  I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family.  And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  No, I don't.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA:  That's all you've got to say?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Thank you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA:  Thank you?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  For helping me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA:  My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  Bran!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  I'm not really, not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA begins to cry.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA:  You died in that cave.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MEERA turns to walk out the door.  She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  EXT WINTERFELL:
s07e04	The Spoils of War	There is a snow blown field.  ARYA is riding on a horse.  Winterfell can be seen far in the distance.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA approaches the main gate on foot.  Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm.  There's indistinct chatter.  One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Hey, oh.  Where are you going?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  In there.  I live here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Fuck off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  I'm Arya Stark.  This is my home.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	Both men look at each and start laughing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Arya Stark is dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick.  They'll tell you who I am.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  There's no Rodrick here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Maester's name is Wolkan.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North.  He's my brother
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  He's a thousand miles away.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  It's cold.  We're busy.  So, you know, best fuck off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Mm-hmm.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Which Lady Stark?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  You tell us.  You're the one impersonating her sister.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Tell Sansa her sister is home.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us.  So for the last time, fuck off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  I'm getting into this castle one way or another.  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.  But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA keeps glancing at the men.  They look uneasy.  They bring her inside of the gate.  They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  You sit there.  Right there.  Don't move.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	Both guards have a conversation out of earshot of Arya.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  Go tell Lady Stark.  I'll watch her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA is glancing around Winterfell.  Men are working building tools and cutting wood.  ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall.  The two guards are still arguing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  You tell her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  I'm not.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The guards turn around and ARYA is gone.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS
s07e04	The Spoils of War	Sansa is sitting at a table reviewing documents.  The two guards are in Sansa's room explaining what happened.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  We told her to wait.  We were standing right next to her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA sighs.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  When we turned around she had gone, My Lady.  She was nothing.  Some winter town girl.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 2:  She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MAN 1:  Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady.  We'll find her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  You don't have to.  I know where she is.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO - WINTERFELL - CRYPTS
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword.  ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching.  SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA hesitates for a moment.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Yes.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA begins smiling then walking towards ARYA.  SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  You shouldn't have run from the guards.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  I didn't run.  You need better guards.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA smirks at ARYA.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  It suits you, Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  He did.  I hope he comes back soon.  I remember how happy he was to see me.  When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	Both girls turn and look at the statue of Ned Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  That doesn't look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Everyone who knew his face is dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  We're not.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA turns to face SANSA.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  I wish I had.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Your list?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Of people I'm going to kill.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA begins to laugh.  ARYA joins her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  How did you get back to Winterfell?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  It's a long story.  I imagine yours is too.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Yes.  It's not a very pleasant one.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  No, they're not.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The girls both embrace again.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Arya, Bran's home too.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA smiles and looks at SANSA.  SANSA doesn't smile back.  The smile fades from ARYA's face.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN is sitting next to the Weirwood tree.  SANSA and ARYA approach.  BRAN turns to look at them.  BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  You came home.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN.  SANSA smiles in the background.  ARYA lets go and steps back.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  I saw you at the crossroads.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  You saw me?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  I see quite a lot now.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Bran has visions.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  I thought you might go to King's Landing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  So did I.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Why would you go back there?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Cersei is on her list of names.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA stares at BRAN.  ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Who else is on your list?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Most of them are dead already.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Where did you get this?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Littlefinger gave it to me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Littlefinger, he's here?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  He's declared for House Stark.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Why would he give you a dagger?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  He thought I'd want it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  Why?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Because it was meant to kill me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  The cutthroat after your fall?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  It doesn't matter.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  What do you mean it doesn't matter?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  I don't want it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN holds the knife out to ARYA.  ARYA looks at BRAN.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Are you sure?  It's Valyrian steel.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRAN:  It's wasted on a cripple.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA looks down at the dagger.  She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - GATE
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them.  The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell.  Men are milling around doing various jobs.  BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	PODRICK:  Catelyn Stark would be proud.  You kept your vow.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  I did next to nothing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	PODRICK:  You're too hard on yourself, My Lady.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  I'm not a --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE pauses for a moment.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  Thank you, Podrick.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Soon.  They will come back to me.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  He better.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI.  She then continues walking.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  What happened?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI begins smirking.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  Many things.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Many things?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	Jon Snow appears at the bottom of the path.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  Your Grace.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard.  She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  It's all right.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON.  They walk along the beach until they reach a cave.  DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave.  He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls.  He continues walking deeper into the cave.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  So this is it, all we'll ever need.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave.  There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  The Children of the Forest made these.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  When?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  A very long time ago.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  No.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON.  JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals.  The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  They were here together the Children and the First Men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Doing what?  Fighting each other?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall.  There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS turns to look at JON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  No, I don't think I can.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS steps forward closer to JON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave.  As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them.  DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  What is it?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  We took Casterly Rock.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  That's very good to hear.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION and VARYS look at each other.  They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Isn't it?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - BEACH
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The group are all walking along the beach.  Daenerys is displeased.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  We still have the largest army.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  If I've underestimated our enemies --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS begins looking out to the ocean.  Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Enough with the clever plans.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS turns back and looks at TYRION.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  We've discussed this.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  A smart one.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS looks over to JON SNOW.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  What do you think I should do?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  I would never presume to --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  I'm at war.  I'm losing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS begins walking close to JON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  What do you think I should do?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON glances back towards the dragons.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE and PODRICK are sparring.  BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  Don't lunge.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	PODRICK pushes himself back up and picks up his sword.  PODRICK attacks again.  Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  Don't go where your enemy leads you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard.  She begins to approach Brienne.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  Up.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows.  BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  And don't --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	PODRICK stands up and retrieves his sword.  ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  Nice sword.  Very nice dagger.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it.  She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers.  BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA:  If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	SANSA sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA(TO BRIENNE):  It's been awhile since I've trained.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  He didn't beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE chuckles.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE nods her head in agreement.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  Move aside, Podrick.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	PODRICK backs away.  ARYA draws her sword, Needle.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  You can't use that, My Lady.  It's too small.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  I won't cut you.  Don't worry.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  I'll try not to.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack.  BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling.  ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword.  BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA.  BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony.  ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back.  BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt.  BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground.  ARYA quickly gets back to her feet.  BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground.  BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck.  BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRIENNE:  Who taught you to do that?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA:  No one.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARYA collects her sword.  SANSA walks away.  BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him.  BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  What do you think of her?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  Who?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS sighs
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  I believe you know of whom I speak.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  I think she has a good heart.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos.  I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the north to fight him?  10,000?  Less?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  Fewer.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  What?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS and JON near the end of the path.  MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI turns to looks at DAVOS and JON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  Ser Davos, Lord Snow.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  King Snow, isn't it?  No?  That doesn't sound right.  King Jon?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  It doesn't matter.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  Forgive me, but may I ask a question?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  Of course.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  Is the custom different in Naarth?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  The sounds liberating.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  Why did you leave your homeland?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  I was stolen away by slavers.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  I'm sorry.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  She bought me from my master and set me free.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  That was good of her.  Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  You believe that?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	MISSANDEI:  I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS(to JON):  You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON notices a single ship sailing into the bay.  It has a kraken sigil.  MISSANDEI turns to look.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  Is that a Greyjoy ship?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - BEACH
s07e04	The Spoils of War	THEON GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf.  They pull the boat onto the sand.  JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them.  JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other.  JON steps forward towards THEON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	THEON:  Jon.  I didn't know you were here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	THEON steps closer to JON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	THEON:  Sansa, is she all right?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON releases THEON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	THEON:  I should be.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAVOS:  Your sister?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	THEON:  Euron has her.  I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JON:  The queen is gone.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	THEON:  Where did she go?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	CUT TO:  KING'S LANDING - FIELDS
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The Lannister army is returning from sacking Highgarden.  They are delivering gold and food to King's Landing.  There are carts and men that haven't made it into the city gates yet.  JAIME and BRONN are supervising the procession.  RANDYLL TARLEY comes riding up on his horse.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL:  All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Good.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL:  We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.  If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  We are stretched a bit thin.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL:  With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL is clearly disappointed.  He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers.  JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL.  BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks.  DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON:  Ser Jaime.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Rickon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON:  Dickon.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.  Your first battle?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON nods his head in agreement.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  And?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON:  It was glorious.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Come on.  Your father's not here.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON:  All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell.  I knew some of those men.  I hunted with them.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON:  I didn't expect it to smell like that.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME looks over at BRONN
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Well, I learned it when I was 5.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  What?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Listen.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	Horses and high pitched war cries are heard  beyond the hill in the distance.  JAIME takes off at a gallop yelling orders to the soldiers on the road.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Spears and shields!  Spears and shields!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The men jump into action and start arming themselves.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Spears and shields!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  In line now!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL:  Come on, lads.  Not those wagons.  Fall in line.  Fall in line.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The Lannister army gets in formation to repel the invading horde.   Lannister archers line up behind the pikemen.  The horde is drawing closer.  The Dothraki come riding over the hill with curved swords held overhead and screaming.  There are a thousand of them or more.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DICKON draws his sword.  RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	RANDYLL:  Spears armed!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The Lannister pikemen drop their spears into a fighting position and ready their shields.  BRONN rides up to JAIME.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Get back to King's Landing.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  I'm not abandoning my army.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  You're a commander, not a damned infantryman.  These fuckers are about to swamp us.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  We can hold them off.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	A dragon can be heard roaring in the distance.  DAENERYS and DROGON come flying over the Dothraki and over the battlefield.  DAENERYS commands DROGON to attack.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Dracarys!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DROGON breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers.  The men burst into flames and start screaming.  DICKON looks on in shock.  A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down.  JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Hold the line!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The main force of Dothraki crashes into shielded pikemen.  Men on both sides are being slaughtered.  A second wave of Dothraki Screamers ride in.  They switch from a seated position to standing atop their saddles shooting bow and arrow.  The Lannister archers fire back and many men are killed.  DAENERYS and DROGON circle around and billow flames across the battlefield.  DAENERYS steers DROGON down the King's Road.  DROGON spews flames and destroys the carriages along the road.  Carts are exploding into pieces, barrels are flying through the air.  JAIME is looking at the carnage in astonishment.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Archers!  Archers with me!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	A group of archers break from the main battle and follow JAIME and BRONN.  JAIME lines the men up to counter DAENERYS and DROGON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Knock!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	ARCHERS:  Knock!  Draw!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DROGON loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers.  DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Loose!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The archers fire their arrows in unison.  DAENERYS sees the projectiles and turns Drogon so the arrows bounce harmlessly off his breast.  She makes a run on another line of carriages and DROGON burns them in a single breath.  Men are screaming and catching on fire.  JAIME and BRONN survey the damage.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Go get it then.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  I can't shoot with one hand.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN hesitates for a moment.  He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow.  JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Come on!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	A Dothraki screamer wielding two swords charges JAIME.  JAIME is blocking the attacks but is getting overpowered.  DICKON stabs the screamer through his back.  JAIME nods at DICKON.  BRONN is making his way to the crossbow.  A Dothraki screamer sees him and charges.  BRONN reaches behind him and retrieves a small sword.  He throws the sword at the Dothraki but the screamer parries it.  BRONN draws his primary sword and the two men charge at each other.  As BRONN is about to strike, the screamer leans over and cuts BRONN's horse's leg off causing BRONN to fall to the ground.  BRONN's bag of gold hits the ground and splits open.  The screamer is turning his horse around and is about to attack BRONN again.  BRONN abandons the gold and runs into the mayhem trying to lose the mounted rider.  BRONN pushes a flaming Lannister soldier out of the way.  He pulls a sword out of a dead man and uses it to start fighting Dothraki.  DROGON flies overhead and spews flames through the air.  BRONN manages to escape the mounted rider and disappear into the fog.  The screamer dismounts and continues the search on foot.  The screamer climbs onto a covered wagon to check for BRONN.  When he pulls the canvas back he see's BRONN behind the crossbow with a bolt pointed at him.  BRONN fires the bolt and impales the Dothraki screamer.  BRONN pulls a lever and the sides of the wagon drop down revealing the crossbow.  BRONN reloads the weapon and begins making adjustments to line up a shot on DROGON.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Where are you?
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards.  He can see Lannisters being slaughtered.  One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	GUARD:  Your people can't fight.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION is watching the mayhem.  Men are screaming and engulfed in flames.  Horses and carriages run wild with no driver.  JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde.  Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces.  Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire.  DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water.  JAIME sees her approaching his position.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Take cover!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DROGON spits flames into the Lannister position.  The men standing there are reduced to standing ash.  The wind blows them away.  BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow.  He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire.  A bolt sails past DROGON and misses.  BRONN reloads the machine.  DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow.  BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	BRONN:  Come on you fucker.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	DAENERYS:  Dracarys!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	Before DROGON can send flames, BRONN fires a bolt that strikes DROGON in the wing.  DROGON begins to pinwheel out of control towards the ground.  BRONN is smiling.  He whips the machine around and begins reloading.  DAENERYS and DROGON are falling from the sky.  DROGON regains control and begins hovering over the river.  BRONN realizes he doesn't have time to reload and dives out of the way of the incoming dragonfire.  DROGON spits flames at the machine and instantly destroys it.  Flames lick over BRONN but he is uninjured.  DROGON is forced to land on the edge of the river due to his wound.  DAENERYS climbs from her mount and rushes to pull the spear from DROGON's wing.  JAIME is 100 yards from DAENERYS watching her.  She is all alone.  JAIME sees a spear sticking out of a dead man.  TYRION spots JAIME across the battlefield.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  Flee, you idiot!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME looks at DAENERYS and readies himself.  He spurs his horse onward.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME:  Come on, boy.  Come on!
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position.  JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water.  TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	TYRION:  You fucking idiot.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	JAIME is getting close.  DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand.  DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames.  BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire.  Their horses are instantly burned to death.  JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water.  JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	END CREDITS
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The Spoils of War is the fourth episode of the seventh season of Game of Thrones. It is the sixty-fourth episode of the series overall.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	The episode title is a reference to the spoils seized following the Fall of Highgarden.
s07e04	The Spoils of War	From HBO:  The Lannisters pay their debts. Daenerys weighs her options. Arya comes home.
s07e05	Eastwatch	Smoke and fire are seen in the distance across the river.  BRONN breaks the surface of the water and takes a breath.  He pulls JAIME up and JAIME gasps for breath.  BRONN helps JAIME to the shore and drops him to the ground and collapses next to him.  JAIME coughs up water and continues struggling on the ground to breathe.  Both men roll onto their backs and gasp for air.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  You could have killed me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  What the fuck were you doing back there?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Ending the war by killing her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  You saw the dragon between you and her?
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN looks incredulously at JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  And?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME sits up and says nothing to BRONN.  BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  Listen to me, cunt.  Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you.  You don't get to kill you.  Only I get to kill you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  That was only one of them.  She has two more.  If she decides to use them, to really use them --
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  You're fucked.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Don't you mean we're fucked?
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  No, I do not.  Dragons are where our partnership ends.  I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  I have to tell Cersei.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN pauses and looks at JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  Best well jump back in that river.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN stands up and walks away.  JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION is walking over an ash covered ground.  There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about.  Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies.  A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners.  DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --
s07e05	Eastwatch	The camera pans around the prisoners.  The men are covered in filth and blood from the battle.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  -- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children.  That's Cersei Lannister, not me.  I'm not here to murder.  And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.  I offer you a choice.  Bend the knee and join me.  Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die.
s07e05	Eastwatch	A few Lannister men kneel to the ground, while most remain standing.  DROGON roars and moves closer to the men.  Almost all the Lannister men quickly kneel while a few still remain standing including RANDYLL and DICKON TARLEY.  DAENERYS speaks to RANDYLL.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  Step forward, My Lord.
s07e05	Eastwatch	RANDYLL takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  You will not kneel?
s07e05	Eastwatch	RANDYLL:  I already have a queen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.
s07e05	Eastwatch	RANDYLL:  There are no easy choices in war.  Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life.  You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader.  One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION turns to speak to DAENERYS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He would be invaluable at the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	RANDYLL:  You cannot send me to the Wall.  You are not my queen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS turns to look at her Dothraki escort.  The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL.  As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DICKON:  You will have to kill me too.
s07e05	Eastwatch	RANDYLL pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	RANDYLL:  Step back and shut your mouth.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS(to DICKON):  Who are you?
s07e05	Eastwatch	RANDYLL:  A stupid boy.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DICKON:  I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again.  Bend the knee.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DICKON looks to RANDYLL.  RANDYLL nods to his son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DICKON:  I will not.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION turns to speak to DAENERYS.  He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  I'm not beheading anyone.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION pauses and looks over the DROGON.  DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Your Grace --
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal.  The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON.  RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  Dracarys.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DROGON draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men.  They are instantly engulfed in flames.  They both collapse into ash after a few seconds.  There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood.  The Lannister men recoil in horror.  Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground.  DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room.  As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers.
s07e05	Eastwatch	QYBURN:  My Lord.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters.  CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  How many men did we lose?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  We haven't done a full counting.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  It's armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME shakes his head.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI turns and walks away from JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  He didn't.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  After all this time it still amazes me --
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  After.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  And you believed her?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI looks away, then sits down.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO: EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean.   DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back.  DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him.  DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face.  DROGON creeps closer until he is inches  from JON.  JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON.  DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him.  DAENERYS  looks surprised and steps down from her mount.  DROGON turns and flies away.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  They're beautiful, aren't they?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  You weren't gone long.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS turns back to JON.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  No.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  And?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON pauses and doesn't say anything.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  You're not sure how you feel about that?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  No, I'm not.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Thousands.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Ser Davos gets carried away.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  So it was a figure of speech?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON doesn't say anything.  A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD:  This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The guard steps to the side and JORAH MORMONT stands behind him.  DAENERYS answers the guard in Dothraki.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  He is my friend.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH kneels before DAENERYS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH stands.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I served with your father.  He was a great man.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH nods to JON.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  You look strong.  You found a cure?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.  I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  It would be my honor.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS steps forward and hugs JORAH.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  EXT. WINTERFELL
s07e05	Eastwatch	A group of ravens are resting on a tree.  Several of the ravens' eyes wash white.  They take off and fly over Winterfell.  They cross frozen fields and over a snowy mountain.  They arrive at The Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-sea and continue over the Wall.  The ravens fly many miles over tundra and more mountains.  The birds crest a hill and thousands of dead men can be seen marching south.  A group of riders and the Night King are on top of an outcrop watching the dead file past.  As the ravens approach the Night King peers in their direction and the birds scatter and disperse.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRAN's eyes are pure white.  They wash back to their normal color.  He is sitting in front of the Weirwood.  Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRAN:  Ravens.  We need to send ravens.
s07e05	Eastwatch	WOLKAN nods his head to BRAN.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARCHMAESTER MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table.  MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents.  SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls.  MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 1:  I put very little stock in it myself.  Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  I remember Wolkan.   A bit timid but a sharp mind.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 1:  The north has dulled many good maester's wits.  I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company.
s07e05	Eastwatch	All the maesters chuckle.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 1:  A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAM stops working and turns around.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  It is a bit much.  Still we ought to --
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  Brandon Stark --
s07e05	Eastwatch	The maesters all turn in their seats to look at SAMWELL.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  -- the crippled boy.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  Do you know him?
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  And?
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one.  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 1:  Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL steps forward and clears his throat.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 1:  That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  Archmaester --
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  That will be all, Tarley.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAM turns to collect his work and leave.  The maesters begin talking to one another.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 2:  It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The maesters all chuckle.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 1:  Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The maesters continue laughing.  SAMWELL gets the last of his work and walks out of the door in disgust.  MAESTER 1 turns to look at MARWYN.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 1:  Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  I'm afraid so.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MAESTER 2:  Horrible business.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  I don't have the heart to tell him yet.  He's a good lad.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
s07e05	Eastwatch	MARWYN:  Right.  The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone.  VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone.  TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  Not burn him alive alongside his son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it.  He grimaces as he drinks.
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, "I'm not the one doing it."  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, "I'm not the one doing it."  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, "I'm not the one doing it."
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION.  TYRION picks it up.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Daenerys is not her father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Who is that for?
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  Jon Snow.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Did you read it?
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  What's it say?
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  Nothing good.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table.  TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen.  DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table.  JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON interrupts VARYS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I need to go home.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  You said you don't have enough men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION begins walking around the table closer to JON.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  So bring the dead to her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS(to JON):  Is that possible?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  And how would you get into King's Landing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	Everyone in the room stops and looks at DAVOS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION nods his head.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	VARYS:  Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON pauses and stares at the ground.  JORAH breaks the silence.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS turns to look at JORAH.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  They won't follow Ser Jorah.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  They won't have to.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  I haven't given you permission to leave.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL
s07e05	Eastwatch	Northen lords including ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE and LYANNA MORMONT are congregated in the Great Hall.  ARYA walks into the room and hears a loud discussion.  The lords are adressing SANSA who is seated at the head table.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ROBETT:  The King in the North should stay in the north.  We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The men agree in unison.  YOHN ROYCE stands up and walks in front of SANSA.
s07e05	Eastwatch	YOHN:  The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The men sit down and everyone in the hall begins talking to one another.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLS
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The girls arrive at SANSA's quarters.  ARYA is glancing around the room.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  These are mother and father's chambers.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  And?
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  Nothing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  Don't do that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA turns around to face ARYA.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  What?
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  Say what you mean.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  Are you angry with me?
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  Their opinions are important to you?
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  Glover has 500 men.  Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  Not if they lose their heads first.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  How can you even think such a horrible thing?
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA:  I have work to do.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANSA turns and walks away from ARYA.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA:  My lady.
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA exits the room.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  KING'S LANDING - BEACH
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing.  DAVOS is securing a small row boat.  TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION turns to look at DAVOS.  DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION begins walking towards the path.  DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead.  TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  You're not staying here?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  What if someone takes the boat?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  REDKEEP - DUNGEONS
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls.  Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  And here I am ready to train.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Why down here?
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN stops walking and holds his torch out.  TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME.  JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN:  I'll leave you to it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BRONN turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME remains silent and stares at TYRION.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Don't talk about our father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Listen to me --
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME shakes his head and says nothing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  What do you want?
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  I -- I don't.  Daenerys doesn't.  Not right now anyway.  She has a more important request.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM
s07e05	Eastwatch	Men are in the market selling their wares.  A blacksmith sharpens a sword on a grinding wheel.  DAVOS is walking through the market glancing around.  A man in a blacksmith shop pulls a sword from the fire and begins to hammer it on his anvil.  DAVOS walks into the shop.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I wasn't sure I'd find you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The blacksmith puts the sword down and turns around, revealing GENDRY, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I thought you might still be rowing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords.  He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place.  He turns back to GENDRY.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Anybody give you any trouble?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY nods.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I think you need to understand --
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  I'm ready.  Let's go.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  You should know what you're heading into.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY is tossing his tools and apron to the side.  He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  You might want to bring one of those swords.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY removes a giant war hammer from the wall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  -- this I know.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  KING'S LANDING - BEACH
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY and DAVOS arrive at the boat.  GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo.  DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope.  Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  Who should I say I am?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat.  He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  You there.
s07e05	Eastwatch	Both guards have their hands on their weapons ready to draw.  DAVOS starts walking towards the guards and spreads his cloak open.  GENDRY remains by the boat.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  Is that your boat?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  It is.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  The docks are that way.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The two guards look at each other and chuckle.  DAVOS retrieves a coin purse and opens it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Still five gold dragons?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  Are you joking?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  You must be even older than you look.  15.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  15?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  Apiece.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS turns and begins walking back to his boat.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  What's in the boat?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS pauses and turns back to the guards.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Not more gold.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  Wine?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  Mmm.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  I like wine.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  Or hams.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Come and have a look.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The guards walk over to the boat.  As they approach, DAVOS walks to the boat and pulls a cover to reveal the cargo.  As he pulls back the canvas, he throws it over GENDRY's exposed weapon covering it from view.  There are several baskets of fermented meat.  The guards twist their faces in disgust.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Fermented crab.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  What?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards.  Both men reach out and take a pinch.  The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth.  They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The guards and DAVOS laugh.  The guards turn and start walking back towards the city.  GENDRY nods at them as they go.  TYRION appears at the top of the stairs leading to the beach.  The Goldcloaks see him as he's walking down the path.  TYRION walks by the guards and they exchange glances.  The guards stop and turn back toward the boat.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  Oi, Dwarf!
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS quickly walks to cut the guards off.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  That dwarf --
s07e05	Eastwatch	The guards blow past DAVOS and begin talking to TYRION.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 1:  Where did you get that scar?
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS is still standing behind the guards.  He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Perhaps there's some arrangement?
s07e05	Eastwatch	The two guards turn back to DAVOS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GUARD 2:  Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY can be seen behind the backs of the guards.  He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2.  He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guard's head.  The man drops.  As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  This is Gendry.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  He'll do.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The men grab onto the boat and begin to push it into the water.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME opens the door and step into the queen's room.  CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  That won't be necessary.
s07e05	Eastwatch	QYBURN bows his head and walks to leave the room.  As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	QYBURN:  Ser Jaime.
s07e05	Eastwatch	QYBURN closes the door as he leaves.  JAIME and CERSEI are alone.  CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Why was QYBURN here?
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  I met with Tyrion.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  What did our brother have to say?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Daenerys wants to meet.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  To discuss a surrender?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  To discuss an armistice.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI smirks and looks away from JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  Are you going to punish him?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Tyrion?
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  Bronn.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME looks confused.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME shakes his head.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  You let it happen.  Why?
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant.  JAIME looks shocked.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  Who will you say is the father?
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  You.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  People won't like that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  Do you remember what father used to say about people?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME:  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JAIME reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her.  While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CERSEI:  Never betray me again.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - BEACH
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave.  Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave.  DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  I understand.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  You don't have to worry.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  Understood.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave.  JON is walking along the corridor.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Begging your pardon, Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  You survived King's Landing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Yet again.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Your Grace, this is --
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY steps forward in front of DAVOS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  It's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON looks to DAVOS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  He was meant to keep that to himself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I saw your father once at Winterfell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  I met yours in my shop.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  You're a lot leaner.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  You're a lot shorter.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON stops smiling and pauses a moment.  Then he chuckles.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I grew up on stories about them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Do you know how to use one?
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY shakes his head.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Well, that's a problem.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  I prefer a hammer.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY looks to DAVOS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  He can handle himself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON nods.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  We could use the help.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY(to DAVOS):  I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - BEACH
s07e05	Eastwatch	Two landing boats are sitting on the beach surrounded by two groups of men.  A large sailboat is anchored in the bay.  JORAH places his sword and a case of Dragonglass into the boat.  TYRION walks down the beach and stands next to JORAH.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TYRION:  Take it with you.  You'll bring it back.  Our queen needs you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH nods to TYRION.  DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  We should be better at saying farewell by now.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  Your Grace, I --
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands.  JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats.  JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand.  He turns and continues readying the boat.  JON stands in front of DAENERYS.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS smiles.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS:  But I've grown used to him.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAENERYS nods to JON.  JON turns and walks to the head of the boat.  The men take hold of it.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Heave!
s07e05	Eastwatch	The men push the boat into the sea.  DAENERYS and TYRION remain on the beach watching them go.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO: CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAM is seated at a table surround by papers and candles.  He is writing notes into a book.  Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome.  SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GILLY:  Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAM:  No.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GILLY:  15,782.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAM looks up from his work annoyed.  He remains silent and continues working.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GILLY:  Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL looks away and pauses.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  None anymore.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GILLY:  That's true.  This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything.  He even recorded his own bowel movements.  What does "annulment" mean?
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GILLY:  Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing --
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL isn't paying much attention to GILLY.  He loudly interrupts her.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored.  But that's all right, isn't it.  We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GILLY:  Steps.  That number was steps.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL is dismayed.  He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr.  He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  CITADEL - LIBRARY
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAM is walking through a dark library.  He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate.  He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel.  After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library.  He pauses before he leaves and turns around.  He glances back at the library.  It is many stories tall lined with countless  shelves of books.  SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  EXT. CITADEL
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL is loading a wagon with his things.  He walks around to the driver seat.  GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road.  SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GILLY:  Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SAMWELL:  I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The horse neighs and begins pulling the carriage away from the city.  The Citadel can be seen with a torch burning bright on top of the tallest tower.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - KENNELS
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation.  The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear.  ARYA can't hear the conversation.  ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll.  The servant turns to leave.  BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished.  BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH.  He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE.  She can't hear what's being said.  BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men.  ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - HALLS
s07e05	Eastwatch	ARYA is walking down the hallway.  She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters.  BAELISH appears and unlocks his door.  Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him.  She continues watching the men.
s07e05	Eastwatch	WOLKAN:  I found it, my Lord.
s07e05	Eastwatch	WOLKAN hands BAELISH a raven scroll.
s07e05	Eastwatch	WOLKAN:  It took some searching.  Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BAELISH reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BAELISH:  Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
s07e05	Eastwatch	WOLKAN:  Yes, my Lord.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BAELISH:  Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
s07e05	Eastwatch	WOLKAN turns and walks away.  BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door.  ARYA continues watching.  A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves.  After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve.  She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll.  She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value.  She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing.  She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding.  She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll.  She unrolls it and reads the contents.
s07e05	Eastwatch	"Robb, I write to you with a heavy heart. Our good king Robert is dead, killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt. Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me very well and provide me with every comfort. I beg you: come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithfull sister, Sansa."
s07e05	Eastwatch	Arya rerolls the note and exits the room.  She locks the door behind her and leaves the hallway.  After a moment BAELISH emerges from a dark corner, watching ARYA with a smirk on his face.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO: EASTWATCH - BEACH
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch.  JON looks up at the castle.  The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO:  INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND, JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I've been failing at that job of late.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  How many queens are there now?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Two.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Both.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  How many men did you bring?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON looks around the table.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  Not enough.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  The big woman?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON smiles and shakes his head.  TORMUND is disappointed.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  We were hoping some of your men could help.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there as you well know.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND nods his head.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  You are.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND turns to look at JON.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  You really want to go out there again?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON nods.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  You're not the only ones.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO: EASTWATCH - CELLS
s07e05	Eastwatch	The raiding party walk down to the Eastwatch cells.  TORMUND is leading them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The men look into the cells.  It is occupied by SANDOR CLEGANE, THOROS of MYR, and BERIC DONDARRION.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  You're The Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANDOR pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  They want to go beyond the Wall too.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BERIC:  We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.  Our lord told us the great war is coming.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them.
s07e05	Eastwatch	The men turn to look at GENDRY.  GENDRY walks up and presses his face to the bars of the cell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  Thoros?
s07e05	Eastwatch	THOROS sits up from a dark corner.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  I hardly recognized you.
s07e05	Eastwatch	THOROS:  Ser Jorah Mormont --
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
s07e05	Eastwatch	THOROS:  They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  He was my father.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND:  He hunted us like animals.
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  You returned the favor, as I recall.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BERIC:  Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
s07e05	Eastwatch	DAVOS:  Our reasons aren't your reasons.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BERIC:  It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BERIC stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
s07e05	Eastwatch	BERIC:  There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
s07e05	Eastwatch	SANDOR:  For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole.  Are we coming with you or not?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JORAH:  Don't you want to know what we're doing?
s07e05	Eastwatch	THOROS:  Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  He's right.  We're all on the same side.
s07e05	Eastwatch	GENDRY:  How can we be?
s07e05	Eastwatch	JON:  We're all breathing.
s07e05	Eastwatch	TORMUND hands the cell keys to JON.  JON opens the door and let the men out.
s07e05	Eastwatch	CUT TO: EASTWATCH - RANGER GATE
s07e05	Eastwatch	The ranger gate opens and the raiding party consisting of TORMUND, JON, GENDRY, THOROS, SANDOR, JORAH and BERIC stand at the edge of the true north.  There is a blizzard raging and snow blows over the tundra.  JON looks back at the party and the men glance at each other.  THOROS drinks from a flask of wine.  JON looks back to the north and the men begin marching into the wild.  A group of Wildlings pull a sled loaded with equipment behind the raiding party.  The men disappear into the white of the blizzard.

s07e06	Beyond the Wall	Script in progress
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	INT. DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	The camera floats over the painted table showing detailed carvings of rivers, holdfasts, and cities.  A fire burns in the hearth.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	CUT TO:  BEYOND THE WALL
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	A raiding party consisting of JON SNOW, TORMUND, GENDRY BRATHEON, JORAH MORMONT, SANDOR CLEGANE, BERIC DONDARRIAN, THOROS of MYR and several Wildlings are ranging beyond the wall of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.  The men trek through a frozen valley filled with jagged rocks.  The Wildlings are pulling a sled loaded with gear and provisions.  The camera shifts and the men are climbing a steep mountain covered in snow.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON(to Gendry):  Are you all right?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY faces JON and grunts.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  Ever been north before?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY:  Never seen snow before.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  You've never been down south.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  I've been to Winterfell.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  That's the north.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	The group of men continue north.  A Wildling scout is ahead of the group surveying the area.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY(to TORMUND):  How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  We have to make due with what we've got.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON glances at GENDRY.  GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  This one is maybe not so smart.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  Davos says he is a strong fighter.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Good.  That's more important than being smart.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND looks at JON as they continue to walk.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	The camera pans out to a frozen vista.  The men are walking across broken slabs of ice and tundra.  There are mountains and a lake of ice in the distance.  The view shifts to GENDRY walking along with THOROS, BERIC and SANDOR.  THOROS is carrying his wine flask.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	THOROS:  Are you still mad at us, boy?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY:  You sold me to a witch.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	THOROS:  Priestess.  I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY:  I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Sounds all right so far.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY:  -- and put leeches on me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Was she naked too?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	THOROS:  She needed your blood.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY:  Yes. Thank you.  I know that.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  It could have been worse.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY:  She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  But they didn't, did they?  So what you whinging about?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	GENDRY:  I'm not whinging.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR motions to BERIC.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR walks away to join the group.  BERIC and THOROS smile to each other.  THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	THOROS:  Good lad.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	The camera shifts to the head of the line.  JON is walking with JORAH.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  Your father wanted to execute me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  I heard.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH and JON glance at each other.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  I'm glad he didn't capture you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  Me too.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON hands the sword to JORAH.  JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH pauses, then nods at JON.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  He gave it to you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  I'm not his son.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JORAH:  I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	Snow is falling into the courtyard.  The ground is covered with several inches of snow.  Several braziers are burning and a servant carries a bucket of steaming water across the grounds.  ARYA is standing on the upper level looking into the courtyard.  SANSA approaches her from behind.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  I remember.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA starts a slow clap.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA turns to look at ARYA.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  What?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  "Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  You don't have to read it.  I remember.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  "Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa."
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  They forced me to do it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  They told me it was the only way to save father.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  You were there?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  I wanted to.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  But you didn't.  Just like me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  I was training.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  You never would have survived what I survived.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  I guess we'll never know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  What are you doing to do with that letter.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  I don't know yet.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  Arya --
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, "But I was just a child"?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANSA:  You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA:  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	ARYA turns and walks away.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	CUT TO: - BEYOND THE WALL
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	The raiding party are marching single file acorss the frozen tundra.  SANDOR stops to tie a fur cover over his boot that came loose.  TORMUND approaches him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  You’re the one they call the dog.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Fuck off.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR looks up at TORMUND.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Gingers I hate.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND points and motions to SANDOR's burned face.  SANDOR slaps his hand away.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Don't point your fucking finger at me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR walks away to rejoin the group.  TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  I didn't trip.  I was pushed.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Ever since you've been mean.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Will you fuck off?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR stops and turns to TORMUND.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Dick?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Cock.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Ah.  Dick.  I like it.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  I bet you do.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR stops and glances at TORMUND.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  Brienne of Tarth.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  You know her?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND nods.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  You do know her.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  We've met.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR and TORMUND begin walking.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TORMUND:  I'm good at killing people.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	The camera shifts to the middle of the line.  JON and BERIC are walking together.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  You don't much look like him.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  Who's that?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  You knew him?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  I serve the north.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  The north didn't raise you from the dead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  He wants you alive.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  Why?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  I don't know.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  So what are you fighting for?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  But we all die.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  "I am the shield that guards the realms of men."
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	BERIC:  Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	JON:  Aye.  Maybe that's enough.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR stops and looks into the distance.  There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  That's what I saw in the fire.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR points towards the mountain.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  A mountain like an arrowhead.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	THOROS:  Are you sure?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR turns to THOROS and nods his head.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	SANDOR:  We're getting close.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	The men start walking towards the base of the mountain.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TYRION is sitting in a chair staring into the fire.  DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	DAENERYS:  Do you know what I like about you?
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TYRION:  I honestly don't.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	DAENERYS:  You're not a hero.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TYRION:  Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	DAENERYS walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TYRION:  I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	DAENERYS:  I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TYRION:  It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	DAENERYS:  Jon Snow's not in love with me.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	TYRION:  Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	Season 7 – Episode 6 – Beyond the Wall
s07e06	Beyond the Wall	From HBO: Jon and the Brotherhood hunt the dead. Arya confronts Sansa. Tyrion thinks about the future.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EXT. Outside King's Landing
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	GREY WORM and the Unsullied stand in formation in front of King's Landing. JAIME and the Lannister forces survey them from atop the rampart. BRONN walks the length of the rampart, overseeing the men.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The camera shifts to a courtyard. The soldiers work, boiling pitch, filling barrels and rolling them up to the defensive wall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Oil?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SOLDIER: Pitch, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: How many barrels?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SOLDIER: 500, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Get 500 more.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SOLDIER:  Yes, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The soldier exits and BRONN walks the wall to JAIME
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: I still enjoy it when they call me "my lord."
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: The thrill will fade.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Gold?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Not without a cock, you don't.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Yet, your brother--
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	A trumpet blares. Men howl and whoop in the distance, accompanied by thundering hoofbeats. The Dothraki crest the hill behind the disciplined unsullied army. They are savage and shrieking. They ride through and past the Unsullied.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN: Archers, stand tall!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN #2: Cover that wall!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EXT. The Sea Outside King's Landing
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	An Ironborn fleet rests next to the castle. More Ironborn ships approach.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Deck of Ironborn Ship.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION, THEON and VARYS stand on deck, looking to the distance as their ship sails in. TYRION joins JON, JORAH, MISSANDEI and JORAH on the foredeck.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON:  How many people live here?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: A million, give or take.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	INT. Below deck of the Ironborn Ship
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR descends a staircase into a dark hold, bearing a lantern. He advances carefully and stops at a crate. He gives one knock, and the WIGHT screeches in a frenzy, shaking his crate prison. Satisfied that the WIGHT lives, SANDOR turns and exits.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	INT. King's Landing
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI, QYBURN and JAIME stand in a royal chamber.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Why isn't she with them?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	QYBURN: I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: And the rest of them?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	QYBURN: They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Including our brother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	QYBURN: Yes, Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI and JAIME walk into the adjacent room, where the MOUNTAIN stands.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI:  If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI exits, followed by the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN and JAIME
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EXT. Outside King's Landing
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON, TYRION, JORAH, MISSANDEI and DAVOS walk ahead of their Dothraki guards. VARYS, THEON and SANDOR are further back.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MISSANDEI: Why did they build it?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JORAH: Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Lannister guards approach, led by BRONN and accompanied by BRIENNE and PODRICK.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAVOS: Maybe it still is.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The Dothraki, led by Qhono, look suspicious. BRIENNE and SANDOR exchange a look.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The Lannister guards part, clearing the path. TYRION nods to QHONO, who takes the lead. The Dothraki all move forward, followed by the rest. PODRICK meets TYRION.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	PODRICK: I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Supporting the enemy, no less.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	PODRICK: Hard to blame you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Cersei will anyway.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	PODRICK: I'm glad you're alive.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: (Shakes his head.)
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Further back on the road.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The WIGHT's crate is drawn by horses, en route to the meeting site.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SOLDIER: What's in there?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: Fuck off.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: I thought you were dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: Not yet. You came pretty close.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: I was only trying to protect her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: You and me both.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: She's alive. Arya.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: Where?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: Who's protecting her if you're here?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: It won't be me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The camera shifts forward as they travel to the meeting.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	PODRICK: It is, my lord.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: I'm sure your new queen--
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: You've been thinking about our new queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	VARYS: And that would be double what now, exactly?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: It's good to see you again.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Yeah, you, too.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Outside the Dragon PIt
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR attends to the cart transporting the WIGHT.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: The Dragon Pit
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The party enters the ruin of the dragon pit. Lannister banners decorate the walls, and the stage has been furnished with open tents for the summit. Everyone files in, Lannisters to the right, Northerns to the left.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRONN: Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE gives her permission to PODRICK, who exits with BRONN. JON watches them go.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JORAH and TYRION look around. SANDOR paces.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: You might.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI enters with the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN, EURON and JAIME. JON and CERSEI exchange glances. So do BRIENNE and JAIME, CERSEI and TYRION, EURON and THEON. The royal party seats themselves, and SANDOR and the MOUNTAIN exchange looks. The Cleganes walk to confront one another before the dais.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR: Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR walks away. The MOUNTAIN watches him go, then takes his place behind Cersei.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Where is she?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: She'll be here soon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Didn't travel with you?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: No.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Everyone waits. Then, dragons screech. JAIME and EURON stand to watch the dragons arrive.  Drogon lands powerfully next to the stage and roars. TYRION turns to look at CERSEI. JON and DAVOS look on as Drogon roars again, lowering his head to reveal DAENERYS on his back. Drogon climbs down to the dragon pit, and DAENERYS dismounts. She walks to the dais as Drogon flies away. DAENERYS and CERSEI eye one another as she takes her seat next to TYRION.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: We've been here for some time.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: My apologies.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS looks to TYRION, who stands in response.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: We are all facing a unique
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: Theon! I have your sister
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION and JAIME exchange confused glances. JAIME shakes TYRION off.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON walks towards TYRION.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Perhaps you ought to sit down.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: Why?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Sit down or leave.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The MOUNTAIN moves forward, threatening to enforce CERSEI's will. EURON laughs and returns to his seat. THEON watches silently.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: We all know that will never happen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Then why are we here?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON rises and walks forward to make his case.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: Yes. That's all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: The word of a would-be usurper.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANDOR returns, bearing the crate on his back. He puts it down, removes the chains and bars that lock it. He removes the lid, and stands back in caution, grasping the hilt of his sword. Nothing happens. He kicks over the crate to reveal the WIGHT, who charges towards CERSEI, screeching horribly. SANDOR follows, while the WIGHT reaches for the frozen CERSEI. At the last minute, SANDOR pulls the chain that binds him, yanking the WIGHT off of its feet.  JAIME and the MOUNTAIN stand to protect CERSEI. The WIGHT turns its attention to SANDOR. He draws his sword, and slices the WIGHT in half as it attacks him. Both halves of the WIGHT continue to move. The upper half crawls towards SANDOR, who slices away a forearm. QYBURN picks up the undead arm to examine it. JON takes it, and with Davos's help, lights a torch.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON:  We can destroy them by burning them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON sets the hand aflame, and it writhes. The WIGHT screeches helplessly. JON drops the arm.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON stabs the WIGHT in the heart with his dragonglass knife, and the WIGHT falls lifeless after a final screech. CERSEI stares in disbelief, and DAENERYS watches. JON approaches CERSEI.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI looks to JAIME.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: How many?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: A hundred thousand, at least.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON rises to investigate the lifeless WIGHT.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: Can they swim?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: No.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: What are you talking about?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON walks over to DAENERYS.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON: I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	EURON exits.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: (SIGHS)
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: In return, the King
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: Just the King
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: (CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON looks to DAVOS and DAENERYS.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI, JAIME, QYBURN and the MOUNTAIN move to leave. BRIENNE follows.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE hits JAIME on the arm
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: Oh, fuck loyalty!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Fuck loyalty?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRIENNE: This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME looks to CERSEI, who turns and walks away with QYBURN.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: And tell her what?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME exits.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Those that remain contemplate what has happened.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAVOS: I wish you hadn't done that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: I know!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAVOS: Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: I did this. I should go.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION:  She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: (Nods)
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Tyrion exits.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: King's Landing portico
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Tyrion walks the halls of the castle, followed by the MOUNTAIN. He meets with JAIME.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: You spoke with her?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION advances, and the MOUNTAIN leads him inside
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Council Chamber.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The MOUNTAIN accompanies TYRION into the chamber to meet CERSEI.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION:  I didn't know about that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION:  Cersei, I didn't know.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: the destruction of this family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: You killed our father
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father--
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION:  I have never been more sorry about anything.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I will not hear it, not from you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: (starts)
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I will not hear it!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI pauses.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The MOUNTAIN readies to draw his sword. CERSEI sighs and sits back, eyes closed. The MOUNTAIN stands back. TYRION pours himself some wine and drinks it down. He pours another glass, and walks back to CERSEI, placing his cup on her desk. He takes another glass..
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I will not
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION:  I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION pours himself wine and takes a drink.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Mm, not like this.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Yes.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Why?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: Because I think she will make the world a better place.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI cradles her belly and TYRION notices. She takes a deep breath.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION: You're pregnant.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI does not answer.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Side Area of the Dragon Pit
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON picks up some bleached bones from the dirt floor. DAENERYS approaches him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: No one is less happy about this than I am.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS takes the bone from JON.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (Speaks Valerian.) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	She hands the bone back to JON.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: I can't have children.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: Who told you that?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: The witch who murdered my husband.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: So, what now?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: (Laughs)
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	They hear footsteps, and they walk back to the others. The camera shifts to the main area of the Dragon Pit. TYRION walks in alone. He is followed by CERSEI, the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN, JAIME and the Lannister guards. The northern delegation watches as they approach the dais.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: The North
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	A raven flies in the wintery night towards Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Winterfell interior
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: What does that have to do with anything?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: You think he wants to marry her?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: She's your sister
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Why did she come to Winterfell?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: And after she murders you, what does she become?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Lady
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA contemplates.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Dragonstone Map Room
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON, DAENERYS, DAVOS, JORAH, THEON, VARYS, MISSANDEI, GREY WORM and TYRION strategize.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JORAH: Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS: I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Dragonstone Throne Room
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON and DAVOS walk through the room, away from the meeting. THEON trails behind.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: Jon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON and DAVOS stop and turn.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: Can I speak with you?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: All right.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAVOS exits.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: Not compared to me, you haven't.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: No. Not compared to you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: Our father was more of a father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: He was.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: I did.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: (SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: But the things I've done.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. (SNIFFLES) She needs me now.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON: So, why are you still talking to me?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON exits.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: The shores of King's Landing
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG and the ironborn load their skiffs, preparing to depart.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON approaches
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: Your sister--
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON:  She's not dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG:  She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: She's our queen
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: She's your sister
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: I did. I ran from my uncle.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON:  We're done with all that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: Who says we are?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG spits in THEON's face. The men laugh.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN: He needs to shut his mouth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG swings a strong blow to THEON's chin. THEON reels, but recovers to throw a counter-punch. HARRAG evades the blow, they grapple and THEON is thrown to the ground.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN: Hey!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The ironborn are enjoying the fight. THEON gets up and the grapple, before HARRAG lands a head butt. Followed by a leveling punch to the face.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN #2: Oh, yes!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN #3: That's more like it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON charges, grabbing HARRAG around the waist. But HARRAG gets the better of him, and THEON ends up back on the sand, bloodied.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: Stay down or I'll kill you!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON gets up, woozy. HARRAG punches him again, and he crumbles to the sand, groaning.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	HARRAG: (panting) I said stay down or I'll kill you!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON gets up again, and they set on one another. HARRAG knees THEON in the groin, but there is no reaction. He does it again. THEON is emboldened. He head butts HARRAG, then tackles him. He sits astride HARRAG and delivers repeated, punishing blows to his bloodied face. HARRAG is defeated.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON: Not for me. For Yara!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MEN: Yara!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	THEON staggers to the water, and he cleanses his face.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: King's Landing Exterior
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Sansa contemplates the landscape on a grey, snowy day from the ramparts of Winterfell. She makes up her mind and walks towards a guard.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Have my sister
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: The Great Hall of Winterfell
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA and BRAN sit at the great table, with WOLKAN standing to the side. The room is filled with northmen. The guards escort ARYA into the hall, and leave her standing alone in front of the table. ARYA looks around and spies YOHN ROYCE, then LITTLEFINGER.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: Are you sure you want to do this?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: And what does honor demand?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: All right, then. Get on with it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA and ARYA turn their heads towards LITTLEFINGER, as do the others in the room. LITTLEFINGER is dumbfounded.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: My sister asked you a question.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: I did it to protect you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Whatever your aunt
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: I know of no such letter.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: You held a knife to his throat.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER turns to face BRAN, surprised at this knowledge he has.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: You said, "I did warn you not the trust me."
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: You told our mother
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA draws the knife.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: If we could speak alone, I can explain everything.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, please.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: (Nods.)
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JOHN ROYCE: I think not.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER kneels before SANSA.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: And yet, you betrayed her.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: I loved you. More than anyone.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: And yet, you betrayed me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA rises.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA steps briskly towards LITTLEFINGER, and slashes his throat with his own knife, swiftly.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LITTLEFINGER: Sansa! (GASPS) I--
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA returns tableside, and everyone watches as LITTLEFINGER dies.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Jaime paces into the yard. CERSEI watches from the upper level.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN: It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Ser Jaime.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The lords bow in union to CERSEI
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: My lords, I need a moment with my brother.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MEN: Your Grace.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME dismisses them and the lords exit. CERSEI walks down to ground level to join him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: What are you doing?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Preparing the expedition north.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: I made a promise.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Our child will rule Westeros.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: And then what?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: And then we rule.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: How many dragons did you see at the pit?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Two.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: What happened to the third?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father--
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: I didn't conspire with him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: And that will be treason.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Treason?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: Disobeying your queen
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME starts to exit, but he is blocked by the MOUNTAIN.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI: I told you no one walks away from me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI:  There's one more yet to come.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: Give the order, then.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CERSEI hesitates, and JAIME thinks that he has called her bluff. Then CERSEI nods to the MOUNTAIN, who unsheathes his sword. JAIME looks nervous, then makes up his mind.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME: I  don't believe you.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME moves past the MOUNTAIN, who lets him go. CERSEI starts after him, but lets him go.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Outside King's Landing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JAIME rides his horse away from KIng's Landing. He inspects his golden hand, then fits his glove over it. He looks up into the grey day, as snow flurries come down. He rides off.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Montage of King's Landing at night.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Winterfell Interior
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN sits by the fire. There is a knocking on the door.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: Come in.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM enters.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: Samwell Tarly.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: I remember everything.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Sam closes the door.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: Oh! I don't know what that means.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this  in a vision?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN holds up a scroll delivered by a raven.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: Oh.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: He needs to know the truth.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: The truth about what?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: It's not.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: Dornish bastards are named Sand.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM: At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: Are you certain?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SAM:  It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Flashback
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN observes the wedding of RHAEGAR and LYANNA.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	RHAEGAR:  Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LYANNA: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	RHAEGAR and LYANNA kiss.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Boat interior
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	JON knocks on a door and DAENERYS answers.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: He loved her. And she loved him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS lowers her arm to invite JON in. The door closes. TYRION watches from the hall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Flashback
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LYANNA has given birth to JON, but she is dying. NED kneels beside her, holding her hand.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: And Jon -  Jon's real name.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	LYANNA: His name is Aegon.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Boat Interior
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	DAENERYS and JON are making love on her bed, passionately.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN: He's never been a bastard.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TYRION continues to stand in the hallway outside their door.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN'S VOICE: He needs to know. We need to tell him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: Winterfell Exterior
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA and ARYA stand on the ramparts.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: Are you all right?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: You did the right thing.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: You did it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Does that bother you?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: "In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Father
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	ARYA: I miss him.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	SANSA: Me, too.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD OF WINTERFELL.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BRAN sits in front of the godswood.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	CUT TO: The Wall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Ravens caw as Tormund and Beric patrol on the top of the wall. They look out towards the North.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	BERIC: It's a long way down.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TORMUND: Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Figures start to emerge from the forrest.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN: I can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	MAN #2: What is it?
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	A huge undead army emerges from the trees. The white walkers are mounted, holding a spear. Dark clouds swirl. A horn blares as the undead army gets closer to the wall. The undead army stops, and all is still.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Atop the wall, TORMUND and BERIC look out nervously. A dragon's screech comes from the darkness. The undead Viserion flies in, and spits out blue flame at the wall as he passes. TORMUND and BERIC stare in disbelief. The Night King rides astride the undead dragon. TORMUND and BERIC hurry down from the watchtower.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	TORMUND: Come on!  Run! Run!
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	The Night's Watchmen flee as the undead dragon attacks the wall will blue flame. The wall begins to buckle and fall. The stairways shake and destruct. Many fall to their deaths. The undead army watches, motionless. TORMUND and BERIC barely escape from the collapsing section of the wall. Once it has come to the ground, the undead army starts to advance. The army seems endless, and includes undead giants. The Night King leads from above, riding Viserion. The undead march south of the wall.
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	From HBO
s07e07	The Dragon and the Wolf	Everyone meets in King’s Landing to discuss the fate of the realm. In Winterfell, Sansa confronts Arya. Sam reaches Winterfell, where he and Bran discover a shocking secret about Jon Snow.
s08e01	Winterfell	A young boy runs through a snowy forest woods, he crosses a shallow stream and then runs through the streets of the winter town. As he runs through the town, pigs squeal and donkeys bray. He reaches the street and stands among a large crowd, struggling to see what is happening on the road. A man steps aside and the boy pushes through. Pan up to see ARYA STARK smiling as she watches the boy run through. A large army is marching along the road and the boy continues to run alongside them. He finds a tree and climbs up it to get a good view. Pan up to see the army marching along the road from the winter town up to Winterfell. A man's shout can be heard, and the boy turns to face the rear of the army. Pan around to see the large army of DAENERYS TARGARYEN. Cut to the middle of the army marching through the streets, DAENERYS and JON SNOW atop their horses. Cut to ARYA, she looks at JON and smiles, she starts to speak but says nothing as he rides by. Many people of the town stare at the troops marching through. SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE is on a horse of his own with the army. ARYA sees him but says nothing. GENDRY is also riding on a horse, ARYA looks at him and smiles as he goes past.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE
s08e01	Winterfell	A carriage is among the army and it carries within it TYRION LANNISTER who sits opposite LORD VARYS.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.
s08e01	Winterfell	VARYS: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: Because I have balls, and you don't.
s08e01	Winterfell	The army continues to march and MISSANDEI and GREY WORM ride alongside each other. The villagers stare at them disapprovingly. People also stare at JON and DAENERYS as they ride past.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
s08e01	Winterfell	A dragon roars and the villagers look up at the sky in fear. People start clamouring as DAENERYS’ dragons, DROGON and RHAEGAL, fly overhead. ARYA emerges from the crowd smiling. The dragons swoop over Winterfell and SANSA STARK watches them fly overhead from the walls of Winterfell.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS and JON ride into Winterfell towards a crowd of people standing within. BRAN STARK is sitting at the front of the crowd. JON rides up to him and dismounts his horse. He walks up to BRAN and kisses him on the forehead.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Look at you.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON sniffles.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: You're a man.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRAN: Almost.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON looks at him quizzically and then up to SANSA who is standing next to him. He walks up to her and gives her a hug. JORAH MORMONT and DAENERYS watch from behind.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Where's Arya?
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: Lurking somewhere.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON turns around to DAENERYS and she walks over to him.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA looks at DAENERYS hesitantly.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRAN: We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS turns to look at BRAN.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRAN: He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA, DAENERYS and JON all look at each other concerned.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?
s08e01	Winterfell	A young boy stands up from the side of the room and walks forwards.
s08e01	Winterfell	UMBER: We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.
s08e01	Winterfell	He stops and then turns to look at JON.
s08e01	Winterfell	UMBER: And my lord.
s08e01	Winterfell	He stops again and then turns to look at DAENERYS.
s08e01	Winterfell	UMBER: And my queen. Sorry.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
s08e01	Winterfell	UMBER bows and walks out the hall as people chatter.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
s08e01	Winterfell	MAESTER WOLKAN: At once, Your Grace.
s08e01	Winterfell	WOLKAN exits.
s08e01	Winterfell	LYANNA MORMONT: "Your Grace."
s08e01	Winterfell	LYANNA stands up and walks forwards
s08e01	Winterfell	LYANNA: But you’re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I’m not sure what you are now.
s08e01	Winterfell	People start murmuring.
s08e01	Winterfell	LYANNA: A lord? Nothing at all?
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: It's not important.
s08e01	Winterfell	LYANNA: Not important? We named you King in the North.
s08e01	Winterfell	People start cheering.
s08e01	Winterfell	MAN: King of the North!
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.
s08e01	Winterfell	People murmur. TYRION stands up and walks to the centre of the room.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.
s08e01	Winterfell	People grumble and yell out indistinctly.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Whatever they want.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e01	Winterfell	Many men move around wagons full of dragonglass. One man knocks a bit out of a wagon and GENDRY catches it before it hits the ground.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.
s08e01	Winterfell	MAN 1: Sorry ’bout that.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY climbs into the back of one of the wagons.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: Are these the last of the wagons?
s08e01	Winterfell	The camera cuts to TYRION who is watching over the courtyard.
s08e01	Winterfell	MAN 2 (O.S.): Aye.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY (O.S.): All right, let's get it all to the forges.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION walks up to SANSA and YOHN ROYCE.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: My lord. My lady.
s08e01	Winterfell	ROYCE turns to look at SANSA, who nods back.
s08e01	Winterfell	ROYCE: My lady.
s08e01	Winterfell	ROYCE exits.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: It had its moments.
s08e01	Winterfell	They both glance at each other, remembering the murder of JOFFREY BARATHEON.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: Apologies for leaving like that.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: We both survived.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
s08e01	Winterfell	There is a short silence.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: She did.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: And you believed her?
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA exits and TYRION turns to see BRAN staring at him from the courtyard.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD
s08e01	Winterfell	JON stands next to the weirwood tree and looks at the face carved into the trunk
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA (O.S.): You used to be taller.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON turns around to see ARYA standing near him.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: How did you sneak up on me?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: How did you survive a knife through the heart?
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I didn't.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA laughs, they both run towards each other and embrace. Once they break from their hug, JON looks down to see ARYA's sword and scoffs in disbelief.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: You still have it.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA unsheathes her sword.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Needle.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Have you ever used it?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Once or twice.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA puts Needle away. JON pulls out his sword, Longclaw, and hands it to ARYA.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Valyrian steel.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Jealous?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA scoffs.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Too heavy for me.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON sheaths his sword and puts his hand on ARYA's shoulder.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: She doesn't like your queen, does she?
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: She's the smartest person I've ever met.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Now you're defending her?
s08e01	Winterfell	JON chuckles.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: You?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: I'm defending our family. So is she.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Yeah. I'm her family too.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA hugs JON.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Don't forget that.
s08e01	Winterfell	Pan down from a view of the Red Keep to see QYBURN walking up to CERSEI LANNISTER who stares out at the sea.
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI's lips curl.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: Good.
s08e01	Winterfell	She exits as the camera pans around. EURON GREYJOY's Iron Fleet is out at sea and QYBURN turns to look out at them.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: EURON'S SHIP
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON smiles and stares out at King's Landing from his ship. He walks in the cabin
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: EURON'S SHIP - CABIN
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON walks inside and past YARA GREYJOY who is tied to a post in the cabin.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA: Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON walks up to her and crouches down.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON chuckles and pops the lid off his drink.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
s08e01	Winterfell	He sighs.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA: Are we in King's Landing?
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Mm.
s08e01	Winterfell	He turns and offers his drink.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA: You picked the losing side.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
s08e01	Winterfell	He stands up and turns to look her in the eyes.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON exits.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: RED KEEP – GREAT HALL
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, EURON and HARRY STRICKLAND stand opposite her.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: Twenty-thousand men, is it?
s08e01	Winterfell	HARRY: Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: Horses?
s08e01	Winterfell	HARRY: Two thousand.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: And elephants?
s08e01	Winterfell	HARRY: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
s08e01	Winterfell	HARRY: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.
s08e01	Winterfell	HARRY: We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.
s08e01	Winterfell	HARRY bows and exits.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Am I most welcome here?
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON starts to walk forward but GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE steps in the way. EURON stops but leans towards CERSEI.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: I was hoping we could talk in private.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: After the war. That was our agreement.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Wars sometimes last years.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI stands and starts to walk out.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: How?
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI stops.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI turns around to face EURON.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: They were lesser men.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI walks towards the door but halts. She turns around and looks at EURON. EURON chuckles and follows CERSEI, staring at THE MOUNTAIN as he walks past.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN is on a bed in brothel with three women around him, DIRAH, CRAYAH and MAREI.
s08e01	Winterfell	DIRAH: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
s08e01	Winterfell	CRAYAH: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
s08e01	Winterfell	DIRAH: Archie, was it?
s08e01	Winterfell	CRAYAH: And William.
s08e01	Winterfell	DIRAH: Tall handsome William?
s08e01	Winterfell	CRAYAH: Yeah, tall handsome William.
s08e01	Winterfell	DIRAH: They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
s08e01	Winterfell	CRAYAH: Did you?
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: Nearly killed it.
s08e01	Winterfell	MAREI: That's brave.
s08e01	Winterfell	MAREI pushes BRONN back and climbs on top of him, CRAYAH and DIRAH climb on the bed either side.
s08e01	Winterfell	CRAYAH: That boy Eddie.
s08e01	Winterfell	DIRAH: The ginger?
s08e01	Winterfell	CRAYAH: That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
s08e01	Winterfell	DIRAH: How does he sleep with no eyelids?
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN (O.S.): Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN sits up and all four of them look at QYBURN who is standing in the doorway.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: You're kidding me.
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN sighs and removes MAREI from his lap.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN stands up and starts dressing himself. CRAYAH walks up to QYBURN.
s08e01	Winterfell	CRAYAH: You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
s08e01	Winterfell	The three women leave.
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN chokes on his drink and coughs.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: Which girl?
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: Yeah, well, good luck with that.
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
s08e01	Winterfell	A guard brings in a large crossbow, the one that TYRION had previously used to murder his, JAIME's, and CERSEI's father, TYWIN LANNISTER.
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
s08e01	Winterfell	BRONN: That fucking family.
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?
s08e01	Winterfell	QYBURN walks up to BRONN and holds out the crossbow. After a short silence, BRONN takes it. QYBURN exits whilst BRONN looks at the crossbow in his hands.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI is standing behind a chair and sighs.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: I wanted those elephants.
s08e01	Winterfell	The camera pans to reveal EURON getting dressed. He sighs and CERSEI walks around the chair and sits down.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: So, how do I compare to the fat king?
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: You're insulting my late husband?
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON walks up to her and whispers in her ear.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Are you offended?
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: And the Kingslayer?
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI glares at EURON.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON chuckles.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Life is boring.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: You're not boring, I'll give you that.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON smiles and walks up to CERSEI, standing over her.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: Do I please the queen?
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON chuckles.
s08e01	Winterfell	CERSEI: But now I want to be alone.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON leans down and speaks softly to CERSEI.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON: I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
s08e01	Winterfell	EURON exits and tears start to form in CERSEI's eyes.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: IRON FLEET
s08e01	Winterfell	A door can be heard open and then close, a bow string creaks and then an arrow pierces a man's head. More and more of EURON's men drop dead and a group of men walk over their bodies. YARA is still tied to the post in the cabin and looks up when she hears a bang. Suddenly, a body falls through the door with an axe in his face. THEON GREYJOY walks in after it, retrieves the axe and unties YARA. THEON helps YARA to her feet before she turns to him and headbutts him. THEON falls to the floor, stunned, and YARA extends a hand. THEON grabs her hand and they both exit the cabin.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: THEON'S SHIPS
s08e01	Winterfell	Three ships from the Iron Fleet sail together.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA (O.S.): Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA and THEON stand on deck next to one another.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA: We can take our home back.
s08e01	Winterfell	THEON: Daenerys went north.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA: Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
s08e01	Winterfell	THEON pauses and sighs.
s08e01	Winterfell	THEON: You're my queen. I go where you command.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA turns to him.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA: You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
s08e01	Winterfell	THEON turns to YARA.
s08e01	Winterfell	THEON: What is dead may never die.
s08e01	Winterfell	They embrace and YARA leans to his ear.
s08e01	Winterfell	YARA: But kill the bastards anyway.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS' army are camped outside the walls of Winterfell and wagons and horses enter the front gate.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE
s08e01	Winterfell	Inside the gate, WOLKAN is greeting ALYS KARSTARK as the KARSTARKS arrive.
s08e01	Winterfell	WOLKAN: Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me
s08e01	Winterfell	WOLKAN and ALYS exit, VARYS, DAVOS SEAWORTH and TYRION are watching on.
s08e01	Winterfell	VARYS: The Karstarks.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAVOS: Can't argue with that.
s08e01	Winterfell	The three men start walking with each other.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAVOS: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: And our queen is grateful.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAVOS: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION stops and thinks. He then catches up with DAVOS and VARYS who continued to walk.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAVOS looks out over the castle wall.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAVOS: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?
s08e01	Winterfell	VARYS and TYRION walk forward to look over the wall with DAVOS, they see JON and DAENERYS standing and talking with each other.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: They do make a handsome couple.
s08e01	Winterfell	VARYS: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: I'm not that old.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION looks up at VARYS and then at DAVOS.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: Not as old as him.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAVOS chuckles.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
s08e01	Winterfell	VARYS: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.
s08e01	Winterfell	TYRION: What is that?
s08e01	Winterfell	VARYS: Nothing lasts.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL
s08e01	Winterfell	JON and DAENERYS walk together as men shout indistinctly in the background.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Your sister doesn't like me.
s08e01	Winterfell	They both stop and turn to one another.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
s08e01	Winterfell	Three Dothraki men ride up to DAENERYS.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): How many today?
s08e01	Winterfell	DOTHRAKI MAN #1: Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
s08e01	Winterfell	The Dothraki men ride away.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON (speaking the Common Tongue): What's the matter?
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: The dragons are barely eating.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS walks off and JON follows.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: What's wrong with them?
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: They don't like the North.
s08e01	Winterfell	She touches DROGON's nose and RHAEGAL looks at JON and gets close. DAENERYS climbs on DROGON's back and, smiling, nods towards RHAEGAL.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Go on.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON looks at the dragon, unsure as to what to do.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I don't know how to ride a dragon.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: What if he doesn't want me to?
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.
s08e01	Winterfell	Defeated, JON walks around the side of RHAEGAL and then climbs on top whilst grunting.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: What do I hold onto?
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Whatever you can.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON grabs onto the dragon, which then proceeds to lift off whilst chittering. DAENERYS watches and smiles, before leaning forwards, cuing DROGON to follow suit. The dragons continue to fly higher, RHAEGAL turns side-to-side causing JON to yell out. They fly over the soldiers outside Winterfell and past TYRION, DAVOS and VARYS who are standing at the castle wall, staring in disbelief as they watch. DROGON flies ahead of RHAEGAL and continues higher before nosediving; RHAEGAL follows after his brother. They continue calmly before reaching a canyon, where the dragons dive straight down, before flying along the canyon floor. Once out of the canyon, RHAEGAL turns off, so DAENERYS instructs DROGON to do the same. She lands down next to JON. JON and DAENERYS, now dismounted from their dragons, walk together away from the dragons.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: You've completely ruined horses for me.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS giggles and then notices a large waterfall, they stop.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: We could stay a thousand years-
s08e01	Winterfell	She turns back to look at JON.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: No one would find us.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: We'd be pretty old.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS chuckles and the two walk up to one another.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: It's cold up here for a southern girl.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: So keep your queen warm.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON pulls her in and kisses her. The dragons start to growl softly causing JON to pull away.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Don't be afraid.
s08e01	Winterfell	They smile and continue their kiss in each other's embrace. JON opens his eyes to see DROGON staring at them.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - FORGES
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY amongst other men occupy the forge, using the furnaces to create weapons from dragonglass
s08e01	Winterfell	MAN 1: Gendry?
s08e01	Winterfell	MAN 2: He's here.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY hears and grabs a large axe made from dragonglass. He hands it over to SANDOR.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANDOR: You're saying you're good, is that it?
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
s08e01	Winterfell	SANDOR: You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA (O.S.): Leave him be.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY and SANDOR turn to see ARYA and stare at her.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANDOR: I heard you were here. You left me to die.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: First I robbed you.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANDOR stands up and walks over to her, not breaking eye-contact.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANDOR: You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANDOR exits and GENDRY walks up to ARYA.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: Yeah, thanks. So have you.
s08e01	Winterfell	He pauses.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: I mean, you look good.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Thanks. So do you.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY pauses, he then walks away whilst still talking to her.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA follows.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Stay close to that forge, then.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: Is that a command, Lady Stark?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Don't call me that.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: As you wish, milady.
s08e01	Winterfell	She smiles and chuckles.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Here's my wish.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA hands GENDRY a piece of parchment with a detachable spear drawn on it, with a dragonglass tip.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Can you make it?
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: What do you need something like this for?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: Can you make it or not?
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: You already have a sword. What's that?
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA removes a Valyrian steel dagger from her person and hands it to him.
s08e01	Winterfell	GENDRY: It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA smirks and takes the dagger back.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA: You don't know any other rich girls.
s08e01	Winterfell	ARYA walks off before turning back and smiling and then back around again without breaking stride.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA is reading a letter when there is a knock on the door.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: Come in.
s08e01	Winterfell	The door creaks open and then shuts. JON walks in before stopping next to her. SANSA sighs.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: "House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years." Isn't that what he said?
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: "I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA stands up and walks a bit before stopping and turning to look at him
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: "The King in the North."
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I told you we needed allies.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: And a Targaryen queen.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON sighs.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.
s08e01	Winterfell	They fall silent and JON sighs.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Do you have any faith in me at all?
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: You know I do.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA sighs.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: No, she's much prettier.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON scoffs.
s08e01	Winterfell	SANSA: Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
s08e01	Winterfell	He looks up at her.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY
s08e01	Winterfell	A door creaks open and then shuts as DAENERYS and JORAH enter the library. They walk to where SAMWELL TARLY sits and JORAH nods in his direction. DAENERYS clears her throat.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Oh!
s08e01	Winterfell	Startled, SAMWELL stands up and dusts himself off.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: So you're the man?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
s08e01	Winterfell	JORAH: They could, they just wouldn't.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Well, there must be something I could give you.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL nods.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: For what crime?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.
s08e01	Winterfell	JORAH and DAENERYS both smile to themselves.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: And also a sword.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS looks at him, confused.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: From the Citadel?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS' face drops and she looks concerned.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Not Randyll Tarly?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: You know him?
s08e01	Winterfell	He looks at her, surprised. JORAH looks guilty.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
s08e01	Winterfell	JORAH looks down as SAMWELL tried to hold it together. He gulps.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS' face is stern.
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Your brother stood with your father.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL's lips start quivering and his breath becomes shaky.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?
s08e01	Winterfell	DAENERYS: Of course.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL exits quickly, and DAENERYS and JORAH look at each other.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL heads outside before being startled by a horse carrying a wagon. He stops and sees BRAN staring at him from across the courtyard. He walks over.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: What are you doing out here?
s08e01	Winterfell	BRAN: Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL shakes his head.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?
s08e01	Winterfell	BRAN: I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - CRYPTS
s08e01	Winterfell	JON blows out a candle and stands back to look at his father, EDDARD STARK's, statue. He sighs and hears a man grunting and a thud. He walks around the corner to see SAMWELL stand up.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Sam?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON grabs SAMWELL and hugs him tightly.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Were you hiding from me?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Of course not.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
s08e01	Winterfell	He looks at SAMWELL's face and sees he is worried.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: She's good.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Little Sam?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Don't you know?
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Know what?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON looks at SAMWELL, shocked at the news he is hearing.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: She didn't tell you.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Would you have done it?
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I wasn't a king.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: But you were. You've always been.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I gave up my crown, Sam.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON starts walking away, SAMWELL follows.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON stops immediately, pauses and turns around.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: What are you talking about?
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON exhales sharply.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON walks up to SAMWELL:
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON takes a couple of steps back whilst breathing heavily.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: Daenerys is our queen.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: She shouldn't be.
s08e01	Winterfell	JON: That's treason.
s08e01	Winterfell	SAMWELL: It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
s08e01	Winterfell	BERIC DONDARRION and TORMUND with a group of others walk into Last Hearth to find it deserted. BERIC enters the building first, the others following cautiously behind. While exploring a dark hallway, a sudden noise startles the group and they press themselves against the walls, weapons drawn as the sounds turn into footprints. Suddenly, TORMUND leaps around the corner to confront the source of the noise with a roar, the rest of the group yelling in preparation to attack the enemy, but instead they find DOLOROUS EDD and others of the Night's Watch.
s08e01	Winterfell	EDD: Stay back, he's got blue eyes!
s08e01	Winterfell	TORMUND: I've always had blue eyes!
s08e01	Winterfell	Everyone pauses and lowers their weapons with sighs of relief.
s08e01	Winterfell	BERIC: Did you find anyone?
s08e01	Winterfell	EDD leads BERIC and TORMUND through a large hall, faintly illuminated by BERIC's ignited sword. When they reach the far wall there is a young boy impaled on the wall with several spirals of limbs surrounding him.
s08e01	Winterfell	EDD: The Umber boy.
s08e01	Winterfell	BERIC: It's a message. From the Night King.
s08e01	Winterfell	TORMUND: His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
s08e01	Winterfell	EDD: We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
s08e01	Winterfell	TORMUND: If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.
s08e01	Winterfell	UMBER's eyes open.
s08e01	Winterfell	TORMUND: We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
s08e01	Winterfell	UMBER starts shrieking, the three men start clamoring and BERIC shoves his sword in the boy, both igniting him and causing him to shriek even louder. The shrieking eventually stops, but not before the entire mosaic of appendages has been engulfed by flames.
s08e01	Winterfell	Men are marching along the long road up to Winterfell, a cloaked figure rides a horse.
s08e01	Winterfell	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s08e01	Winterfell	The cloaked man rides the horse up to the stable and dismounts as men around shout indistinctly. He removes his hood and JAIME LANNISTER's face is revealed. He sighs and looks around the courtyard before BRAN catches his eye. JAIME stares at him in disbelief at the camera zooms in on BRAN's face.
s08e01	Winterfell	Upon reaching Winterfell with their combined armies, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen learn the Army of the Dead has breached the Wall, and the Night King commands the undead dragon, Viserion. The Northern lords and their allies rally around Winterfell, but distrust Daenerys and doubt Cersei Lannister’s pledge to provide her army.
s08e01	Winterfell	At King’s Landing, Euron Greyjoy returns from Essos with the Golden Company and entices Cersei to consummate their union. On Cersei’s orders, Qyburn hires Bronn to assassinate her brothers, Tyrion Lannister and Jaime Lannister.
s08e01	Winterfell	Theon Greyjoy rescues his sister, Yara Greyjoy, who then sets out to retake the Iron Islands while Theon returns to Winterfell.
s08e01	Winterfell	At Winterfell, Jon reunites with Bran Stark and Arya Stark, and later learns to ride Daenerys' dragon, Rhaegal. Samwell Tarly meets Daenerys, who reveals that she executed his father and brother. After Sam and Jon are reunited, Sam reveals Jon’s true identity is Aegon Targaryen, king and rightful heir to the Iron Throne.
s08e01	Winterfell	At House Umber’s seat of Last Hearth, Tormund Giantsbane and Beric Dondarrion encounter Dolorous Edd and other Night’s Watch members. They find the castle’s occupants dead and Ned Umber’s body used as a gruesome message from the Night King.
s08e01	Winterfell	Jaime arrives at Winterfell where Bran is awaiting him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME LANNISTER stands in the Great Hall of Winterfell.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS TARGARYEN: When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera cuts to a wide view of the hall and we see a multitude of guards placed around the room and the many who ally with House Stark. Sitting at the head of the room is DAENERYS in the centre of a long table; JON SNOW sits on her left and SANSA STARK on her right and JAIME is standing in the middle of the room facing DAENERYS. On the left of the room there is a shorter table where TYRION LANNISTER, LORD VARYS, MISSANDEI and JORAH MORMONT sit. On the right there is another table where DAVOS SEAWORTH, LYANNA MORMONT, LORD YOHN ROYCE, ALYS KARSTARK and BRIENNE OF TARTH sit
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME’s eyes lowered.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She pauses.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Your sister pledged to send her army north.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: She did.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION looks up at his brother and JAIME looks back.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS turned her glare towards TYRION.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: "We"?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION steps forwards towards DAENERYS.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Your Grace, I know my brother-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Like you knew your sister?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION looks to JON and SANSA.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: The things we do for love.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS, SANSA and JON all turn slowly to look at BRAN who sits to the side of SANSA. JAIME looks at him and BRAN maintains eye-contact.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Because this goes beyond loyalty.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He looks around to see BRIENNE, then turns back.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: This is about survival.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS. BRIENNE then stands up.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: You don't know me well, Your Grace.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She walks from behind her table to stand in the middle of the Hall beside JAIME.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She then addresses SANSA.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA looks down and then back up at BRIENNE.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: You vouch for him?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: I do.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: You would fight beside him?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: I would.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: What does the Warden of the North say about it?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She turns to JON who sighs.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: We need every man we can get.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The room falls silent as DAENERYS thinks to herself.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Very well.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION exhales sharply in relief. GREY WORM picks up JAIME’s sword, walks over to him, handing it over aggressively.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Thank you, Your Grace.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS stands up and the rest of the room does as she does. SANSA exits. DAENERYS turns to JON who exits after his sister. DAENERYS then exits followed by TYRION, VARYS, JORAH and MISSANDEI. JAIME then catches BRIENNE’s eye as she leaves and then he ends up looking at BRAN again who mimics his stare.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – HALLWAY
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS walks along the hallway outside the hall followed by TYRION, VARYS and JORAH.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I was a fool.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Not for the first time.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS stops walking and turns to TYRION.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS exits. TYRION turns to VARYS and JORAH.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - FORGES
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Men chatter indistinctly as they forge the weapons. GENDRY walks into frame, dumping dragonglass out of a bucket. He then walks up to furnace and pulls out some dragonglass, moulding it and then dousing it in a bucket of water. ARYA STARK walks towards him. As the steam rises from the bucket she catches his eye.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Don't you have something better to do?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: You make my weapon yet?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY hands her a small axe with a blade made of dragonglass.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY grabs the axe and brings it down harshly on a wooden stump.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: It's strong enough.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY moves to a pile of dragonglass spearheads and checks on it, ARYA follows.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Are you going to be down in the crypt?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: No, but-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: But you're a fighter.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He glances up at her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: I've done my share.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: You've fought them?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: I did. Some of them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: How many?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: A few. That was enough.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: What are they like?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Bad. Really bad.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: "Really bad"?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She walks behind him and around the other side of the table so she is facing him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Even a smith's apprentice can do better than "really bad." What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA picks up one of the spearheads, turning it in her hand.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: I know Death.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She throws the spearhead, narrowly missing a blacksmith’s head. GENDRY exhales, staring in disbelief at the dragonglass impaled on the wooden beam.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: He's got many faces.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She tosses another landing next to the first. The blacksmith quickly runs away. GENDRY slowly turns back to ARYA who picks up a third spearhead.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: I look forward to seeing this one.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She throws it and it lands with the first two. GENDRY chuckles to himself and ARYA walks back round the table and past GENDRY.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: My weapon?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: I'll get right on it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA walks off as GENDRY watches. He smirks to himself.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera pans from behind a tree to show BRAN sitting in his wheelchair facing the weirwood tree. JAIME walks towards him. He stops a couple feet from him and looks down.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I'm sorry for what I did to you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN turns his head towards JAIME.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME walks around in front of BRAN.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I'm not that person anymore.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: You're not?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: No. I'm something else now.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: You're not angry at me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: I'm not angry at anyone.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Why didn't you tell them?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME nods and raises an eyebrow.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: What about afterwards?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: How do you know there is an afterwards?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME stares at BRAN.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	All of the Northerners are busy building defenses in preparation for the army of the dead as TYRION walks past. JAIME approaches him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Well, here we are.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Yes, here we are.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Together again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	A man standing above them clears his throat and then spits on the floor beside them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: And the masses rejoice.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: How do they feel about their new queen?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: She's your new queen too.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	They start walking together.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: And she is? Different?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: She is.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: You're sure about her?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I am.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: She didn't seem sure about you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Hmm.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	They stop walking and TYRION turns to look up at JAIME.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Was she lying about the baby too?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: No, that part is real.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION thinks to himself and they both start walking again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	They start to walk up a staircase and TYRION turns to look at JAIME.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: What?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION walks ahead as JAIME remains in the same spot. After a couple seconds, he follows. They both walk along the walls of castle looking over the courtyard.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BOTH: A girl's mouth around-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Your cock.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: My cock.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION smiles up at JAIME.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME notices something whilst TYRION continues to talk and walks off.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION glances up where JAIME was and notices he is gone, he looks behind to see JAIME looking over the wall. The camera cuts to show BRIENNE walking outside the walls among the Unsullied.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GREY WORM is seen testing out the traps around the castle as other Unsullied and Northerners work around him. JAIME walks out the front gate. We see PODRICK PAYNE training with a soldier as BRIENNE watches on, smiling proudly. JAIME stands next to her and she glances at him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Lady Brienne.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK blocks the soldier and pushes him back, bettering him. They continue to fight with their swords.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: He's come a long way.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE starts walking away and JAIME follows.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: I am. It's, uh-it's good ground.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: It is.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: The rise, it should give us some advantage.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	They stop walking.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Yes, I think you're right.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE quickly turns to face JAIME.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: What are you doing?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: What?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: I think you know.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I truly don't.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: You want me to insult you?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: No!
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Good.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He pauses.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE goes silent and looks down briefly. She returns his gaze.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: I better get back.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE walks off, leaving JAIME standing alone.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS’ door opens and JORAH walks in.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: Forgive me, khaleesi.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Have you done something to offend me?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: Many things.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Long ago and long forgiven.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: You made the right choice.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH chuckles.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: But the mind behind all those words-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS walks into the library.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ROYCE: The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera pans to show ROYCE and SANSA sitting at a table together.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	They both notice DAENERYS’ presence and stand up.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ROYCE looks at SANSA who nods, granting him leave. ROYCE walks towards DAENERYS, bows and then exits. DAENERYS turns to watch him leave before turning back.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She starts walking towards SANSA.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: You never should have either.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I thought he knew his sister.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: Families are complicated.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Ours certainly have been.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	They both sit down in the seats SANSA and ROYCE were previously occupying.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: A sad thing to have in common.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA returns her uneasy smile.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: He loves you, you know that.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: That bothers you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: All my life, I've known one goal: the Iron Throne. Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours. My war was against them. Until I met Jon. Now I'm here, half a world away, fighting Jon's war alongside him. Tell me, who manipulated whom?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA scoffs; she then leans forward and places her hand on DAENERYS’ hand.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS places her other hand on top of SANSA’s.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: Who was the first?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Someone taller.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	They both chuckle with one another.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: I take the Iron Throne.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS removes her hand and looks away from SANSA. MAESTER WOLKAN enters the library.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	WOLKAN: Apologies, my lady. Your Grace.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS turns in her seat, agitated.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: What is it?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	WOLKAN leads DAENERYS and SANSA into the great hall, where we see THEON GREYJOY standing in the centre of the hall surrounded by many of the Ironborn. DAENERYS looks shocked, THEON walks up to her and bends his knee.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	THEON: My queen.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Your sister?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	THEON: She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: But why aren't you with her?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	THEON looks at SANSA.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	THEON: I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA walks up to THEON quickly and hugs him tightly. THEON hugs back.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – COURTYARD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Many Northerners wait in line to be served food. DAVOS is filling the bowls.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	MAN: Milord, we're not soldiers.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	MAN: Thank you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He nods towards DAVOS and walks off with his bowl.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GILLY: When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera pans to show GILLY leading a young woman and an older couple, showing them where they will stay during the battle.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GILLY: They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	WOMAN: Thank you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TEELA, a young girl, walks up to where the food is being served and holds her bowl up. DAVOS has his back turned.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TEELA: Which way should I go?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS turns back around and looks at her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: Which way do you want to go?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TEELA: All the children will be going below when the time comes.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GILLY overhears the conversation and starts to walk over.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TEELA: But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS takes her bowl and fills it up as GILLY sits down next to her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GILLY: That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: I'm sure a lot of people would.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He hands her bowl back to her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TEELA: All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TEELA walks off and DAVOS smiles at GILLY. A horn is then blared and the gates are opened as the remaining members of the nights watch return with TORMUND GIANTSBANE and BERIC DONDARRION. SAMWELL TARLY greets DOLOROUS EDD who has just returned. JON sees them and quickly heads over. Before he can embrace EDD, TORMUND hugs him first.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: My little crow.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: I thought we'd lost you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: Almost.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON turns to hug EDD. He then turn to BERIC and shakes his hand.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: How did you find each other?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	EDD: We met up at the Last Hearth.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: The dead got there first.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: The Umbers?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BERIC: Fighting for the Night King now.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: How long do we have?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON looks at SAMWELL with a concerned look. TORMUND looks back over his shoulder, surveying his surroundings.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: The big woman still here?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Northern soldiers jog around the walls of Winterfell
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON (V.O.): They're coming.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Men are removing dragonglass weapons from carriages and handing to soldier. The camera pans and GENDRY lifts a dragonglass axe up and hands it to a man.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON (V.O.): We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The Unsullied pull ropes, causing a large boulder to be thrown into the air by a large trebuchet. More soldiers march out of the gates of Winterfell.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON(V.O.): But there are too many of them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – BATTLEMENTS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Archers walk up to the edge of the battlements with their bow and arrows. We see a man stretch the bow string
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON (V.O.): Far too many.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	A horse neighs and the man looks up over the wall.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The Dothraki ride along the outside of the wall as the camera pans past the trench of spikes used to defend from the Army of the Dead.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON (V.O.): Our enemy doesn't tire.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera moves farther down until it reaches a gap in the trench outside the gate, the Dothraki ride through the center as Unsullied soldiers emerge from the gate.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON (V.O.): Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	In the library, a large table has a map of Winterfell laid out over it, with various markers placed outside the castle. The Unsullied are organized in three groups in the middle outside the front of the. To either side of the Unsullied are markers representing the Northerners and in front are the Dothraki. Facing towards all these troops are markers representing the Army of the Dead, these markers far outnumber the allies of Winterfell. Standing around the table (clockwise) is SANSA, JON, ARYA, SAMWELL, THEON, ALYS, BRIENNE, JAIME, BERIC, TORMUND, DAVOS, LYANNA, ROYCE, QHONO, GREY WORM, VARYS, DAENERYS, JORAH and TYRION. BRAN is seated behind JON.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: We can't beat them in a straight fight.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: So, what can we do?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: If that's true, he'll never expose himself.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: Yes, he will.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Everyone in the room turns to look at Bran.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Why? What does he want?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: How will he find you?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: His mark is on me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN lifts the cuff of his right arm, revealing a red mark in the shape of a hand.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: He always knows where I am.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera pans over the map of Winterfell, to the East but still within the walls, is the Godswood.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANSA: You want us to use you as bait?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: We're not leaving you alone out there.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	THEON: He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION looks shocked and turns to her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION nods.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Dragonfire will stop him?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: I don't know. No one's ever tried.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: We're all going to die.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He turns to look at BRIENNE.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: But at least we die together.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: Let's get some rest.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Everyone begins to leave the library as JON and DAENERYS remain at the table.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: Your Grace.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON then exits along with almost everyone else. Only TYRION and BRAN remain.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Do you need help?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: No.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: You've had a strange journey.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: Stranger than most.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I'd like to hear about it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION grabs a wooden chair and drags it over next to BRAN.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRAN: It's a long story.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION sits in the chair.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Unsullied soldiers clean their weapons as GREY WORM walks past. MISSANDEI walks into the courtyard and sees two young girls.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	MISSANDEI: Hello.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The girls quickly grab one another’s hands and run off. GREY WORM stands behind her as she turns around to face him. GREY WORM walks up to her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GREY WORM: When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	MISSANDEI: Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GREY WORM: Then I will take you there.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	MISSANDEI: My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GREY WORM: My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera pans up over the wall and SAMWELL and JON stand next to each other with GHOST, JON’s direwolf, behind them. SAMWELL leans over slightly towards JON.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Have you told her yet?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: No.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He pauses and they both look at each other and fall silent. EDD walks up the stair behind them and stands between them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	EDD: And now our watch begins.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: Gilly? Little Sam?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: They'll be safe down in the crypt.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: If you want to join them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL looks at him and frowns.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: To protect them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	EDD: Thenn.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	EDD: Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Well, calling you "fucked" wouldn't be strictly accurate.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL chuckles and EDD looks at him. He turns to see JON laughing too.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	EDD: Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL sighs.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: Now it's just us three.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	EDD: Last man left, burn the rest of us.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera rises over the wall and the silhouette of the trees in the distance block the light slowly fading over the horizon.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The fire in the hearth of the hall is lit. Two wooden chairs sit facing it, occupied by JAIME to the left of the fire and TYRION to the right. They both sip on wine.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I wish Father were here.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME looks at TYRION in shock.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME snorts.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: That would be something to see.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Mm.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I was speaking in relative terms.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Do you miss it?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Of course I miss it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION sighs
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION raises his cup to toast.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: The perils of self-betterment.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME raises his and they both go to drink. JAIME stops himself when the door to the hall opens and BRIENNE and PODRICK walk in. JAIME stands up quickly and they both turn to look at the visitors.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Oh! My lady.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION walks over to where the wine is kept, PODRICK starts to walk to him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK: Thank you, milord.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: I don't think that's wise.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK turns back to BRIENNE.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: The battle might start at any moment.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She pauses.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Half cup.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: And you?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION continues to pour PODRICK’s drink until the cup overflows with wine.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME places another chair in front of the fire.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: All right. Just a bit.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION pours BRIENNE a drink and hands it to her as she sits down. PODRICK grabs a chair and brings it over and sits down. DAVOS and TORMUND enter the hall.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: Well, what do we have here?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Ser Davos, join us.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS stands in front of the fire to warm up.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND walks up to BRIENNE and stands in front of her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: It could be our last night in this world, you know.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME, now sitting down next to BRIENNE, glances up.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She pauses and quickly tries to recover.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Would you like a drink?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND turns to TYRION and raises his drinking horn.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: Brought my own.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND looks at JAIME, over to BRIENNE, and then back to JAIME again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: They call you "King Killer."
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I'm sure someone does.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: They call me "Giantsbane." Want to know why?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME sighs and looks over at TYRION who is still standing to the side of the room with his wine. TORMUND grabs a wooden chair and places it with his back to the fire so that he is facing JAIME and BRIENNE. He sits down and leans forwards.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS glances at TORMUND, clearly perplexed.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND raises the horn to his mouth and starts drinking from it whilst gulping noisily. Everyone stares at him as the drink pours out the horn, mostly down his front.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: Maybe I will have that drink.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR “THE HOUND” CLEGANE sits with back against the battlements drinking alone. ARYA walks up to him and he notices her. She walks closer and SANDOR silently offers the drink. ARYA sits down next to SANDOR and takes a swig. They sit silently staring ahead.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR: You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Guess I've changed.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She pauses.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: What are you doing up here?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR: What's it look like?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR turns to her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR: I fought for you, didn't I?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BERIC walks up to the two of them and stops in front of them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR: Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BERIC smiles. He turns to look at ARYA.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BERIC: My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR turns to ARYA.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR: Was he on your list?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: For a little while.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BERIC: That's all right.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BERIC sits down on a barrel opposite the two.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BERIC: The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR: Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He points to the wall he’s leaning against. BERIC chuckles and holds his hand out. SANDOR passes him the drink. ARYA stands up and starts walking away from them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SANDOR: Where are you going?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA turns around to look at them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA exits and SANDOR and BERIC sit in silence.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	A bowstring creaks as an arrow is fired. It hits its target next to two other arrows previously shot. The camera cuts to see ARYA holding a large bow in a dimly lit hallway. She lowers it and picks up another arrow. GENDRY watches from a doorway. She fires the arrow and turns as GENDRY walks up to her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: That for me?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY raises a spear with a dragonglass head. ARYA lays down her bow and takes the spear.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: This'll work.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: What did the Red Woman want with you?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Why your blood?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Arya stops fiddling with her new weapon at this revelation and stares at Gendry.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Was that your first time?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Your first time with a woman.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY scoffs.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Or after?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY stammers indistinctly.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: You don't remember?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY scoffs.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Yes, I was.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: One? Two? Twenty?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Well, I didn't keep count.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: Yes, you did.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY sighs.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Three.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA pauses and walks up to him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	GENDRY: Arya, I-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA inhales sharply as she pulls GENDRY in and starts kissing him. They start undressing themselves and each other whilst still kissing. She pushes GENDRY back onto a pile of bags as she takes off her top. GENDRY, who is still just wearing his pants, notices a couple scars on ARYA’s side.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	ARYA: I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	She pulls her own pants off and climbs on top of GENDRY and starts kissing him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The fire is still lit and the people who were in there earlier still sit there. Opposite the fire sits (from left to right) TORMUND, BRIENNE, JAIME, DAVOS, TYRION and PODRICK. They sit in silence before TYRION breaks it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: At least we'll die with honor.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I think we might live.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS and PODRICK both start laughing.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: All without a shred of combat ability.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME stands up to get himself another drink.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: She's not a ser? You're not a knight?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Women can't be knights.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: Why not?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: Tradition.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: Fuck tradition.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE: I don't even want to be a knight.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK looks at her, slightly confused. BRIENNE ignores him.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME places his cup on the table where the wine is kept.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: I'll prove it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME unsheathes his sword and stands in the middle of the room and holds his sword out.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Kneel, Lady Brienne.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE scoffs.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE looks at PODRICK who nods. She stands up, walks to the middle of the room opposite JAIME and kneels before him. PODRICK and DAVOS both turn in their seats to see and TYRION and TORMUND both stand. JAIME places the sword on her right shoulder.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He raises it over her head and places it on her left shoulder.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He raises the sword and places it on her right shoulder again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He lowers the sword to his side.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE smiles as she stands up and the rest of the room all applaud.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE smiles ecstatically, tears of joy in her eyes.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL is walking down the stairs from the battlements
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH (O.S.): We have all we need to win this war.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANNA (O.S.): I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH (O.S.): Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL notices the two talking down in the courtyard and starts to walk towards them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANNA: I don't need you to remind me of that.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	We now see JORAH and LYANNA up close.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANNA: I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANNA turns around to see SAMWELL facing them both.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANN: It's all right. We're done here.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANNA starts to walk off but stops and turns back to JORAH.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANNA: I wish you good fortune, cousin.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: Thank you, my lady.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	LYANNA exits and SAMWELL walks closer to JORAH.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: What have you got there?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL raises his sword.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: You still have a family.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	He hands JORAH the sword and JORAH removes it from its sheath slightly to examine it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JORAH: I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: I'll see you when it's through.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL walks off but stops several feet away and turns back to JORAH.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	SAMWELL: I hope we win.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Everyone sits around the fire still but DAVOS is standing next to where the wine is.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JAIME: We'd better get some rest.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: No, let's stay a bit longer.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: We're out of wine.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS sits back down.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAVOS: You'll pray for a quick death.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION chuckles.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Ser Brienne?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	BRIENNE shakes her head. TYRION turns to TORMUND who shakes his head too.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TORMUND: Mm-mm.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	TYRION: Mmm.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK starts singing “Jenny of Oldstones”.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK: High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – SAMWELL’S QUARTERS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	As PODRICK continues to sing, SAMWELL and GILLY lay in bed with LITTLE SAM between them.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK (V.O.): The ones who'd been gone for so very long.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera pans down to show SANSA and THEON sitting opposite each other. PODRICK's singing continues.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK (V.O.): She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The camera pans and we see GENDRY sleeping on the pile of bags and ARYA lays next to him with her eyes open. PODRICK’s singing continues.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK (V.O.): Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	The Unsullied start walking out of the courtyard as MISSANDEI and GREY WORM walk together before he stops her, turns to her, and kisses her. He then turns to leave with the Unsullied and MISSANDEI watches as he leaves. PODRICK’s singing continues.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK (V.O.): Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Everyone gathers outside the castle as they prepare for battle. JORAH rides on his horse and gazes at the horizon to see only darkness. PODRICK’s singing continues.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	PODRICK (V.O.): Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - CRYPTS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS turns a corner as she sees JON staring at a statue of his biological mother, LYANNA STARK. She walks up to him. He glances at her and smiles as she walks closer. She holds his arm as they both look at the statue together.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Who's that?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: Lyanna Stark.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS looks troubled.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: He didn't. He loved her.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON turns to face DAENERYS.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS starts to look at him, slightly concerned.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS exhales sharply as she pulls away.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: That's impossible.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: I wish it were.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: Who told you this?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: Bran. He saw it.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: He saw it?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON: It's true, Dany. I know it is.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	DAENERYS: If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Suddenly a horn blares and JON turns around.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON and DAENERYS walk behind the battlements and stand next to TYRION as the three stare out over the wall.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	MAN: Form up! Get yourselves back!
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	JON nods at DAENERYS and they both quickly exit. TYRION watches but turns his attention back over the wall. The camera pans away.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	CUT TO: PATH TO WINTERFELL
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	In an icy haze, the mangled legs of a dead horse trot forward before stopping. The camera pans up to show a white walker sitting upon the dead horse and the entire army of white walkers standing in a line upon their horses is slowly revealed. The camera pans around their backs before settling on the faint glow of Winterfell in the distance.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Jaime Lannister reveals Cersei Lannister’s deception to the Targaryen–Stark alliance and, despite Daenerys Targaryen and Sansa Stark’s mistrust, joins their forces after Brienne of Tarth defends his loyalty.
s08e02	A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms	Jaime later apologizes to Bran Stark for crippling him; Bran replies he is not angry, and they are no longer the same people.

s08e03	The Long Night	INT: WINTERFELL PASSAGEWAY, NIGHT
s08e03	The Long Night	SAM shivers and rubs his hands as the wind whistles.
s08e03	The Long Night	NORTHMAN 1: Oi!
s08e03	The Long Night	The Northman surprises SAM by forcing the hilt of a dragonglass sword in SAM's open hands. An armored soldier pushes by. SAM is overwhelmed and anxious.
s08e03	The Long Night	NORTHMAN 2: Mind out.
s08e03	The Long Night	NORTHMAN 1: MOVE!
s08e03	The Long Night	SAM, still shivering, walks through the dark passageway, passing many northern soldiers. He emerges in the courtyard, which is full of activity in spite of the darkness. Men chatter as they prepare. SAM stops short, cut off by Unsullied warriors, marching double time.
s08e03	The Long Night	NORTHMAN: Look, on the west wall!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER: Get down to the crypt!
s08e03	The Long Night	A baby cries somewhere in the courtyard. SAM looks, then nervously changes direction.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER: Just hold.
s08e03	The Long Night	MAN: We'll take him.
s08e03	The Long Night	LYANNA MORMONT appears behind him, directing her men.
s08e03	The Long Night	LYANNA: Come on, help the lads!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Yes, my lady.
s08e03	The Long Night	LYANNA: Quickly, now! Quickly! Get those in position.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Come on.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Close the gate!
s08e03	The Long Night	SAM walks past TYRION, then exits.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: That's it.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION walks somberly through the busy courtyard. He picks up a bag and slings it over his shoulder. BRAN rolls by, pushed by THEON and accompanied by ALYS KARSTARK and some northern soldiers. They walk through the courtyard on their way to the godswood.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	Warmed by their fires, men stand in anticipation, eyes scanning the darkness. DAVOS delivers a bucket of arrows. SANSA and ARYA stare into the darkness. SANSA looks worried. Her eyes turn upwards in response to DROGON's screech. DROGON and RHAEGAL fly overhead.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	A company of Unsullied warriors double march to join the formation. The entire Unsullied company stands at attention in disciplined rows and columns. Ahead of them stands a line of catapults, with stones and braziers by their sides. In front of the siege weapons, the entire Dothraki horde is mounted and waiting, swords drawn.
s08e03	The Long Night	The Northmen also stand at the ready, fronted by JAIME and BRIENNE. GREY WORM stands in command of the Unsullied. TORMUND and BERIC helm the motley wilding force. The HOUND and GENDRY push their way to the front to join them and EDDISON TOLLETT. A nervous SAM arrives. jostling EDD.
s08e03	The Long Night	EDD: Oh, for fuck's sake. You took your time.
s08e03	The Long Night	Horses snort and whinny. A mounted JORAH waits, seasoned and determined, yet also nervous. GHOST stands nearby. The wind blows and the darkness reveals nothing.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A NEARBY MOUNTAINTOP
s08e03	The Long Night	JON walks by DROGON and RHAEGAL. They growl. He joins DAENERYS to survey the great army that waits before Winterfell. The moon shines through the clouds above.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA and SANSA look out. The wind whistles. A lone rider approaches slowly amidst the darkness, catching the eye of DAVOS. He strains to see.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	The rider is MELISANDRE. She silently leads her mount to stop in front of JORAH. She looks at the Dothraki.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: Do you speak their tongue?
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH: (Nods.)
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: Tell them to lift their swords.
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH and MELISANDRE take measure of one another. Then JORAH turns to the mounted horde.
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH: (speaks in Dothraki)
s08e03	The Long Night	The Dothraki respond by raising their weapons. JORAH returns his apprehensive gaze to MELISANDRE. She nudges her horse forward and stops next to QHONO, the nearest Dothraki. She clasps his curved weapon in her left hand, her index finger pressed against the cutting edge. She concentrates as she offers an incantation.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: (speaks in Valyrian)
s08e03	The Long Night	The blade she holds ignites in flame. Quickly, the other raised weapons blaze with flame as well, surprising the Dothraki who hold them. They yell in celebration of the magic.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA and SANSA look on in amazement. The flames travel in a wave through the entire Dothraki force, lighting up the night. DAVOS watches, cautiously.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE, GREY WORM, TORMUND, BERIC, SAM and EDDISON marvel at the sea of fire and the cheers of the Dothraki.
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH nods in approval to MELISANDRE. She rides quietly past the Dothraki force, JORAH turns his mount and draws Heartsbane with renewed vigor. MELISANDRE reaches the last of the Dothraki and turns to ride in front of the Dothraki. She passes by GREY WORM.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: Valar morghulis.
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM: Valar dohaeris.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS watches as MELISANDRE turns again and heads towards the gates of Winterfell. He is not pleased to see her again.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS: Open the gate!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Open the gate!
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA and SANSA look over to DAVOS.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Open the gate!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GATE OF WINTERFELL

s08e03	The Long Night	MAN: Come. Come on. Easy.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE walks through the courtyard.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: WALKWAY
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS and MELISANDRE meet at a raised walkway. She lowers her hood and approaches while DAVOS stares.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos. I'll be dead before the dawn.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS gives way as MELISANDRE walks past. She pauses, half way up the stairs, where she can see ARYA atop the ramparts. In the distance, a soldier yells and the Dothraki ululate. MELISANDRE walks on.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA rejoins SANSA as the mounted Dothraki, spur their horses forward into a charge, yelling wildly. ARYA and SANSA exchange a look.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE DOTHRAKI
s08e03	The Long Night	The Dothraki horde gallops and ululates. JORAH rides among them.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A NEARBY MOUNTAINTOP
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS and JON watch the wild charge. The flaming swords allow them to see the full shape of the onslaught as the Dothraki pull far away from the rest of the forces.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	Northern soldiers light the stones on the the catapults and trebuchets. The stones arc like meteors over the heads of the charging Dothraki.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE DOTHRAKI
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH and GHOST gallop among the Dothraki. The flaming stones crash to the ground in front of them. The snarls of the undead army precede them. Suddenly the two armies are upon one another, the ferocious undead emerging from the darkness, massive in size and in numbers. Some Dothraki are surprised by their sudden confrontation with ghoulish giants.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A NEARBY MOUNTAINTOP
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS and JON watch the flames of the Dothraki swarm around their darkened foes. Burning stones continue to rain down, landing just beyond the mounted fighters. DAENERYS's eyes are wide.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE and JAIME watch from afar. They exchange a look. The lights of the ignited swords dance in battle.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER: (in Dothraki) Cease fire!
s08e03	The Long Night	Slowly the lights dwindle until most are extinguished. The distance sound of battle gives way to the whistling wind. GREY WORM, the HOUND and BERIC look on. The lights become sparser still. JAIME squints to make out the movements in the dark. Then the last of the fires disappear. SAM and EDD exhcange a worried look while GENDRY scans the horizon. An eerie quiet takes hold, save for the sound of the wind. TORMUND ponders.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA and SANSA watch silently.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	The wind carries the sound of a few hoofbeats. GREY WORM listens. A single, riderless horse neighs as it gallops out the darkness towards Winterfell. ALYS KARSTARK watches for more signs of the Dothraki. GENDRY looks about, nervous.
s08e03	The Long Night	A horse whinnies in the darkness, followed by more neighing. Riderless horses trickle back towards Winterfell. SAM is forlorn. Some Dothraki men run past, retreating on foot, followed by more horses. JORAH rides from the darkness along with some Dothraki. TORMUND looks carefully at JORAH for more information. JORAH is exhausted and hopeless, eyes unfocused and leaning heavily to his left side.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A NEARBY MOUNTAINTOP
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS is shocked and horrified. She turns to find her dragons and help her people. JON grabs her arm and stops her, reminder her of the plan.
s08e03	The Long Night	JON: The Night King is coming.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS shrugs off his grip. She fumes as she looks JON in the eye.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS: The dead are already here.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS walks back to mount DROGON. The dragon roars.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	The northern army looks worried. SAM and EDD listen to the whistling wind. The HOUND is edgy. TORMUND and BERIC stand tense and ready. GENDRY grips his sword. PODRICK takes a breath.
s08e03	The Long Night	In front of the Unsullied, GREY WORM's face twists in anger. He puts on his helmet. The wind blows stronger. A soft patter becomes a rumble of running feet as the undead army starts to boil forth the darkness, running at full tilt. Once visible, they come in like a tidal wave.
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM: (speaks in Valyrian)
s08e03	The Long Night	The Unsullied take their braced battle stance, spears pointed forward. The army of wights crashes over them, shrieking and snarling. They stab and slice the Unsullied as they barrel through. TORMUND and the HOUND stand just off to the side with the Northmen and marvel at the sheer force and number of the undead. Then the undead wave reaches them as well.
s08e03	The Long Night	TORMUND: (yells)
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME, BRIENNE and their company brace for the coming onslaught. One soldier abandons his post in fear, pushing his way through the soldiers towards the gates of Winterfell.
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE:  Stand your ground!
s08e03	The Long Night	The undead crash into their cadre at full speed and the battle begins. JAIME fights. BERIC swings his flaming sword. The undead land gruesome blows to the Northmen. BRIENNE is knocked off her feet by a speeding wight and is trapped in a crowd of the undead. JAIME notices and leaps to help. He pierces the wight that has tackled BRIENNE and throws it aside. Just then, the dragons above shoot forth a wall of flame as they dive past, disintegrating a swath of weights. JAIME looks up at the dragons.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS and DROGON ascend as the inferno below them burns. DAENERYS surveys the battle as she looks for her next line of attack.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	The rush of wights continues. TORMUND dispatches some of the wights while behind him, DROGON and RHAEGAL lay down crossing walls of fire.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	JON rides RHAEGAL above the devastation, taking stock of the battle.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	SAM, illuminated by flames nearby, looks up at the dragons.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	RHAEGAL banks past ARYA and SANSA. Further away, DROGON spews forth an arc of flame. RHAEGAL joins in. ARYA and SANSA take in the power of the dragons and the enormity of the undead army.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	JON and DAENERYS fly side-by-side, away from Winterfell. Where the plain meets the woods, JON sees the mounted White Walkers. He and DAENERYS exchange a look, then dive towards their enemy. The White Walkers notice the approaching dragons. Suddenly, a ferocious gale of blowing snow rolls out from the woods, enveloping JON and DAENERYS. JON loses his bearings and fightS to remain aloft. DAENERYS rips through the undead below with DROGON's fiery breath, then struggles against the great storm.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA and SANSA do not like the way the battle is going.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA: Get down to the crypt.
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA: I'm not abandoning my people.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA: Take this and go.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA extends the hilt of a dragonstone dagger. SANSA accepts it tentatively.
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA: I don't know how to use it.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA: Stick them with the pointy end.
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA exits, and ARYA turns to face the battle. She takes her bow from her back.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME grunts as he dispatches another weight. Behind him, PODRICK and TORMUND fight their own foes. The arctic blast from the woods reaches them, and visibility worsens. TORMUND looks up as DROGON and DAENERYS spew forth another fire line of devastation.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON stands by BRAN, his bow strapped around his back. The roiling snow blast reaches them and creates a white out.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH rides through the ongoing fight, Dismembering a wight with one great swing, then another. His face is bloodied and he looks exhausted. As he pivots his mount, a wight tackles him from behind, and he and is horse both fall. He rolls to his feet and continues to battle. Nearby, BRIENNE grunts as she cuts through her assailants. She tries to catch her breath, but a wight attacks before she can. TORMUND's berserk attacks are brutal and effective, but he is also out of breath. JAIME is more deft in his parries and footwork. PODRICK pushes away the wight that tries to take him down. GENDRY and the HOUND also fight in the fray.
s08e03	The Long Night	A wight leaps through the air and wraps himself around JAIME. The Kingslayer tries to shake him off. Another wight tackles TORMUND. SAM shouts and slays an undead fighter. EDD circles behind him, but is taken down be a leaping wight.
s08e03	The Long Night	SAMWELL: Edd! Edd!
s08e03	The Long Night	Another wight tackles SAM before he can help his friend, pinning him to the ground on his back. SAM fights with all he has to stop the undead's blade from forcing into his skull. EDD saves SAM by stabbing the wight through the back. SAM whimpers, and his sense slow as exhaustion takes over.
s08e03	The Long Night	EDD: Sam, get up!
s08e03	The Long Night	EDD grabs SAM's shirt and pulls him to his feet. As SAM regains his strength, EDD is stabbed from behind. Blood spews from his mouth as he gasps and staggers.
s08e03	The Long Night	EDD: Oh, God. Sam.
s08e03	The Long Night	EDDISON collapses. SAM looks at the snarling wight behind EDDISON. SAM turns and flees.
s08e03	The Long Night	WOMAN: Edd!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE CRYPT
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA walks down the steps to the crypt. Above her, the heavy door closes and is locked by a guard. She joins the crowd of women, children and elderly who are huddling in the crypt, along with TYRION, VARYS, GILLY and LITTLE SAM. SANSA takes stock of the crypt's atmosphere and locks eyes with MISSANDEI. Finally, she and TYRION exchange a look. TYRION takes a large gulp from his wineskin and walks away.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	The wind howls. The clouds of snow hang in the air. RHAEGAL flies through. JON holds on to the powerful dragon as they crash through snow-covered treetops. RHAEGAL regains control of his flight. JON gasps for breath. He looks behind him at the peril they escaped. Suddenly, DROGON appears from the snow cloud in front of them, on a collision course. The dragons bank to avoid one another. DAENERYS grunts as she is nearly thrown from DROGON. JON strains to check that DAENERYS is safe as the dragons pull side by side. The dragons struggle to fly against the wind and snow, and JON and DAENERYS are constantly tested by the unpredictable and jerky flight.  Once they have settled, DAENERYS looks down through the blowing snow to take in the battle. The undead army continues to surge forward with inhuman stamina.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	TORMUND grunts as he lands each blow.
s08e03	The Long Night	TORMUND: Fall back! Fall back!
s08e03	The Long Night	A wight stumbles as it tries to attack TORMUND from behind. He raises his weapon and delivers a powerful overhead strike.
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE: Fall back!
s08e03	The Long Night	The Northmen follow the command to retreat.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER: Come on!

s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: Open the gate!

s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE GATE
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM watches as the Northmen retreat through the gate. The undead battle with the Unsullied nearby.
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM: (in Valyrian) Protect the retreat!
s08e03	The Long Night	The Unsullied fend of the ferocious attacks for the undead.
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM: (in Valyrian) Stand your ground!
s08e03	The Long Night	As one, the Unsullied take a defensive stance, spears pointed forward. The undead swarm into them with great force, but the Unsullied slow their progress.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: WINTERFELL GATE
s08e03	The Long Night	Men continue to pour through the gate. Just beyond, the Northmen fall back behind the battalions of Unsullied, who stand at attention. Sounds of the battle beyond ring through the blasts of wind and snow.

s08e03	The Long Night	JON and DAENERYS fight to fly against the storm.
s08e03	The Long Night	JON: Dany!

s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN sits pensively. Above, he can see RHAEGAL fighting to hover before landing heavily on the wall surrounding the godswood. JON looks around.

s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Guard the barricades!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: Through that pass!
s08e03	The Long Night	LYANNA watches the men rushing through. Near the gate, BRIENNE tries to maintain some control of the rushing crowd.
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE: Hey! Hey! Hey!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 4: Close up the gaps!
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE: Go! Hey! Go! Go!
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE ushers PODRICK into the courtyard. Nearby, JAIME takes command of those near him.
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE GATE
s08e03	The Long Night	Men continue to run towards the gate. Beyond the wooden fortifications, the Unsullied stand their ground.
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM: (shouts in Valyrian)
s08e03	The Long Night	The Unsullied grunt as one in response to the command. The undead continue their onslaught, but the Unsullied stop them.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	Northermen flee in great numbers to the gate. Only a handful of lines of Unsullied remain, but the endless waves of undead continue. The Unsullied are near the end of their defensive effort.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE GATE
s08e03	The Long Night	Soldiers run as fast as they can towards the gate. Flaming arrows shoot through the air above them.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Move!
s08e03	The Long Night	TORMUND takes down a wight with a mighty blow. The man beside him does the same, but is felled by an arrow right after. The snarling undead wrestle through the wooden palisades. ARYA takes careful aim and shoots a flaming arrow, felling the wight pursuing the HOUND. He turns around in surprise, looks up to ARYA, then back at the felled creature. He swings his axe anew.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE UNSULLIED
s08e03	The Long Night	The Unsullied begin to fall back.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: (in Valyrian) Retreat!

s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE UNSULLIED
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM runs forward to take stock of the battle. Panting, he watches the undead making slow but constant progress against the last lines of the Unsullied.
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM: Light the trench! Light the trench!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS picks up two torches and waves them to signal GREY WORM's command.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Wait!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: Light the trench!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE UNSULLIED
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM continues to pant as he watches the ferocious undead army battle against the Unsullied and the Northmen in front of him. Deciding that it is time, he grabs a rope and pulls with all his might, triggering the collapse of the wood that spans the trench in front of him. A fury of arrows descends from the ramparts behind him.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS continues to signal with his torches.

s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS:  She can't see us.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS throws down the torches in frustration.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS: Light the trenches!
s08e03	The Long Night	Archers shoot flaming torches at the palisade in the trenches. The harsh wind blows out the flames before the stakes catch fire.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE BATTLEFIELD
s08e03	The Long Night	The seemingly endless undead army continues to surge forward, snarling and growling.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE GATES
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM pants from exhaustion, and removes his helmet.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: With a torch, light the trenches! Right there.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Torch it!
s08e03	The Long Night	The soldiers grab torches from the braziers
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS: Light the trenches!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE GATES
s08e03	The Long Night	The soldiers run from the brazier to towards the trenches. One by one, they tackled by wights before they reach their objective. GREY WORM assesses the battle, and locks eyes with MELISANDRE through the mist.
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH, BERIC, TORMUND and the HOUND protect the gate. Snarling wights try to force their way through the palisades.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS looks down to the gate as a battalion of Unsullied march out.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE GATES
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH, BERIC, TORMUND and the HOUND give way to the Unsullied, who march double time into a defensive formation. They align their shields to form a barrier and a battle stance. MELISANDRE emerges from the gate. The HOUND slays a wight nearby. The Unsullied captain gives a command, and the soldiers stand at attention, creating an aisle for MELISANDRE. She walks to the trench and places her hand on a frozen log, eyes closed.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: (chants in Valyrian) Lord of Light, cast your light upon us. Lord of Light, defend us. For the night is dark and full of terrors!
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH and some Unsullied fight back the charging undead. Flaming arrows streak down from the ramparts into the darkness beyond the trench. The growls of the undead creep out of the darkness.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: (urgently chants in Valyrian) Lord of Light, cast your light upon us! Lord of Light, defend us! For the night is dark and full of terrors!
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND, BERIC and TORMUND stand their ground, helping to protect MELISANDRE. The wights get dangerously close to MELISANDRE, who opens her eyes at the threat.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: (desperately chants in Valyrian) Lord of Light, cast your light upon us! Lord of Light, defend us! For the night is dark and full of terrors!
s08e03	The Long Night	A wight leaps over the trench to grapple MELISANDRE. Just in time, sparks explode between her hands and the log. The oil in the trench quickly ignites, consuming the attacking ghoul and those behind it. The trench erupts into a blinding wall of flame, stopping the swarm of undead attackers. They shriek in surprise and pain. For now, Winterfell is protected from the charge.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	The glow of the flaming trench reaches DAENERYS and JON, who fly high above.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE GATE
s08e03	The Long Night	The fiery wall leaps twenty feet into the air. The flames light up the wall of Winterfell. MELISANDRE looks on her inferno with relief.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA and DAVOS watch as DAENERYS directs DROGON to incinerate a swath of undead beyond the flaming trench.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE TRENCH
s08e03	The Long Night	Some wights squirm and crawl out of the trench, engulfed in flames. Unsullied warriors march past JORAH, BERIC and the HOUND, who fight to catch their breath. Beyond the wall of flame, the undead stand, motionless and staring. The HOUND stares at the scene for a moment and then walks away.
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC: Clegane.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE CRYPT
s08e03	The Long Night	A baby cries, but otherwise the crypt is quiet.
s08e03	The Long Night	WOMAN: You must try not to worry yourself.
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA, VARYS and MISSANDEI sit apart from the others. The residents of Winterfell wait with concern on their faces. GILLY looks at TYRION, who is facing the other way.
s08e03	The Long Night	VARYS: (Sighs.) At least we're already in a crypt.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION: If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.
s08e03	The Long Night	VARYS: (Scoffs.)
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION:  What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
s08e03	The Long Night	VARYS: And got your face cut in half.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION: And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA: You'd die. There's nothing you can do.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION picks up a stool and places it next to SANSA.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION: You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION drinks from his wineskin.
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA: Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION: Maybe we should have stayed married.
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA: You were the best of them.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION: What a terrifying thought.
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA: It wouldn't work between us.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION: Why not?
s08e03	The Long Night	SANSA: The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.
s08e03	The Long Night	MISSANDEI: Yes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already.
s08e03	The Long Night	MISSANDEI stands and walks away. TYRION and SANSA exchange a look.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	The wild whips through the godswood. THEON continues to guard BRAN, bow strapped to his back.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON:  They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN: Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON weighs BRAN's words.
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN: I'm going to go now.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON: Go where?
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN's eyes go white.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A TREE BEYOND THE BATTLEFIELD
s08e03	The Long Night	A raven's eyes go white as BRAN wargs into the bird. The ravens caw as they take flight from the tree, towards the fire wall. DROGON spits forth a blaze of fire into the undead army, just in front of the conspiracy of ravens. They fly past the battle, beyond WInterfell, and climb high into the dark sky. They hear the slow flaps of a great dragon, then come upon the NIGHT KING riding Viserion. The NIGHT KING extends his hand in command, which crackles like freezing water.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE TRENCH
s08e03	The Long Night	The undead army stands motionless behind the flaming trench. One wight steps calmly forward into the trench, falling forward. Then another joins him, and another still. They pile on top of one another at a quickening pace.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS watches as the undead sacrifice themselves, one by one. He realizes that they are forming a bridge of corpses. Other groups of undead tumble into the trench, building other pathways with their bodies. ARYA and DAVOS watch silently. Dutifully, the wights fall like dominoes until they have spanned the trench.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAVOS: Man the walls!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE TRENCH
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Man the walls!
s08e03	The Long Night	The first wave of undead forge across the corpse bridge.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: WINTERFELL COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Man the wall!
s08e03	The Long Night	LYANNA: Man the walls! Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	Soldiers hustle to obey the command. JAIME looks up, then moves to action. JORAH grabs SAM and drags him towards the battle.
s08e03	The Long Night	LYANNA: Get out there! Get moving!
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENNE: Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPARTS
s08e03	The Long Night	Soldiers fire arrows at the approaching ghouls.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE TRENCH
s08e03	The Long Night	The undead pour across the corpse bridges and set upon the walls.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	Riding RHAEGAL, JON watches the onslaught as the undead army restarts their siege. Hearing flapping above, he looks upwards and sees the undead VISIERION hovering, with the NIGHT KING astride him. VISIERION lets out a shriek. JON spurs RHAEGAL and they fly away.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALL
s08e03	The Long Night	The undead reach the exterior wall of Winterfell and press themselves against in en masse. Flaming arrows zip down from the ramparts.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: They're against the wall!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Get more men up here!
s08e03	The Long Night	BRIENE sprints through the yard. JAIME runs up the stairs to the ramparts, ushering soldiers to take position.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Fill the gaps, quickly!
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Get in there!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: They're climbing the walls!
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Relieve the archers!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Relieve the archers!
s08e03	The Long Night	The soldiers and archers jostle and trade places.
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Archers on top!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Move up!
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH ascends the stairs, two at a time. SAM follows.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Go, go! Come here! Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: Move back!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 4: Stand away!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Go on, go on.
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH helps to shepherd the transitions.
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH: Go! Go.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: Step back.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 4: All the way, archers!
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM reaches the ramparts and puts on his helmet.
s08e03	The Long Night	GREY WORM: (speaks in Valyrian)
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH looks down at the undead horde. They are piling on top of one another, creating a ramp for others to ascend to the top of the wall. They snarl and scramble with relentless energy. JAIME looks down at them.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Hold the wall!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: The wall, they're coming up!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: Hold the wall!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 4: Hold the wall!
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH, TORMUND and GENDRY stand ready to meet the wights when they crest the wall.
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Draw!
s08e03	The Long Night	GENDRY takes deep breaths as he looks down, wide eyed, at the relentless ghouls. The undead climb and strain as they approach the top of the wall. The highest wight grabs a chain and pulls himself over the wall. GENDRY cleaves him in two with a mighty swing. JAIME stabs another the face, and it topples away with a high pitched shriek.
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	Soldiers grunt as they slay the cresting wights, one by one. SAM, BRIENNE, TORMUND and GREY WORM defend their perches.  A wight successfully leaps onto the rampart and tackles a soldier. JAIME dispatches him with a left-handed swing. The undead start to overwhelm the defense, crawling their way onto the rampart. JAIME does his best to battle them back. One soldier gets pulls over the wall, and tumbles into the undead mass below.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE WALL
s08e03	The Long Night	Still more wights are pouring across the flaming trench. There is no end in sight. The Northmen fight on, shooting arrows and swinging swords. The undead hiss and growl, crawling over one another with unflagging battle lust.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE RAMPART
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH slices a climbing wight. He hears a yell above him and looks up.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER: They're coming up!
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME grapples with two wights, while BRIENNE goes on a mighty charge across the rampart, sending bodies, beams and snow tumbling to the courtyard below. JAIME is pinned by two wights. BRIENNE finally reaches him, and liberates him from his captors. They fight side by side.
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME: Look out!
s08e03	The Long Night	JAIME slays a ghoul attacking BRIENNE from behind. JORAH takes down another cresting the wall. SAM fights for breath, recovering from the ferocious battle. A growl makes him look up, just in time to see the wight that leaps down onto him. They struggle, and another wight joins in. JORAH appears and delivers a mighty overhead chop that saves SAM. Just beyond, the undead break through the wooden rail as they leap down into the courtyard below.
s08e03	The Long Night	The battle commences in the courtyard as the undead pour down from above, overwhelming the first Northern soldiers that they encounter. Some ghouls mindlessly impale themselves on the stakes of the defensive palisades. Soldiers in the courtyard fight back while archers above unleash flaming arrows into the courtyard. BERIC joins the fray, flaming sword in hand.  Undead pour into the courtyard faster than the Northern soldiers can dispatch them.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A CORNER OF THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND hides in a corner, shuddering. His fear of fire has overwhelmed him. The ghouls and Northerners slash and hack, grapple and tumble.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA uses her spear to slice the head off of a wight as it crests the wall. She runs down the walkway and slashes another ghoul. She expertly counters and gores a few more, then splits her spear in two, giving her a weapon in each hand. She fights her way up a stairway, dispatching wights with martial skill.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A CORNER OF THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC fights on, and notices the HOUND shuddering in the corner.
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC: Clegane! Clegane!
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND hyperventilates in his trance-like state.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA continues her assault, and meets up with DAVOS. She spins, strikes, blocks and kicks, destroying wights left and right. She looks back at DAVOS, who marvels at her skill.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS
s08e03	The Long Night	Arrow rain down as more ghouls rush the wall.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	Wights leap into the yard, tackling Northerners. As LYANNA takes stock the the battle, a wooden gate behind her explodes into shards. An undead giant stand backlit by the flaming trench. It charges LYANNA, who lets out a sharp scream as it bats her away.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e03	The Long Night	A horde of undead blocks the stairway below ARYA. With no other recourse, she leaps, tumbling on top of the undead before taking a hard landing below them. She dodges the attack of a ghoul and scurries away on all fours. As she tries to exit the stairwell, she is pushed into the wall, hitting her head. Momentarily dazed, she regains her feet as the undead attack.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	The undead giant swings its mighty club back and forth, sending soldiers flying across the courtyard. Some land on the palisades, impaled on impact. Cradling her stomach, LYANNA struggles to find her feet. The undead giant unleashes a devastating blow that sends a clutch of men flying through the air.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A CORNER OF THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND remains frozen and panting.
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC: Clegane! Clegane, we need you!
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC steps over to the HOUND.
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC: You can't give up on us.
s08e03	The Long Night	HOUND: Fuck off! We can't beat them. Don't you see that, you stupid whore? We're fighting Death! They can't beat Death.
s08e03	The Long Night	Above them, ARYA leaps from the parapet onto the roof of a courtyard building. She rolls out of reach of a leaping ghoul, who bounces down the roof and into the courtyard below.
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC: Tell her that.
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND looks up at ARYA, who scurries across the roof away from the growling wights. The HOUND, motivated, rouses himself into action.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	LYANNA finds her feet, panting and in great pain. Her face is streaked with blood. She lets out a battle cry and charges the giant, wielding her war axe. The giant turns to meet her assault. He reaches down and grabs her by the chest, His vice-like grip chokes the breath from LYANNA. He squeezes harder and her ribs crack. He raises LYANNA up to his face, taunting her as he crushes the life from her. Blood pours from her mouth as she pants for breath. The one-eyed giant growls at her and draws her closer. LYANNA yells, and frees an arm to stabs the undead giant in his good eye with her dagger,  Her strength leaves her, but the giant crumbles to the ground, shattering into broken shards. The undead continue to pour through the broken gate.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	Above them the NIGHT KING flies on VISIERION through the swirling clouds. The undead dragon roars. DAENERYS and DROGON are in pursuit followed by JON and RHAEGAL. The clouds of snow and gusting winds impede the pursuit.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS and JON fly higher, breaking the clouds to find the moon's illumination. Their dragons hover while DAENERYS and JON scan the skies for a sign of the NIGHT KING. An eruption of blue flame bursts from the clouds below JON. JON and RHAEGAL veer away as the NIGHT KING and VISIERION fly directly upwards, belching blue flame at DAENERYS and DROGON, who try to speed upwards and away. DAENERYS strains against the blue conflagration threatens to swallow them.
s08e03	The Long Night	Meanwhile, JON and RHAEGAL tailspin out of control and fight to regain control of their path. VISIERION unleashes another blue blast. DROGON weaves an evasive path while DAENERYS holds on for dear life. The NIGHT KING and VISIERION turn away and rocket back towards the earth. JON and RHAEGAL finally stem their downward spiral. They come to a hover next to DAENERYS and DROGON, and look anew for signs of the NIGHT KING. JON and DAENERYS exchange a glance, then direct their dragons to dive back into the clouds beneath them.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: WINTERFELL PASSAGEWAY
s08e03	The Long Night	The injured ARYA secrets her way through a quiet passageway. She opens a heavy door and enters a darkened library. She pauses to catch her breath. She hears footsteps and a figure passes just beyond her, knocking into a pile of books.  Another undead man enters, his sword dragging as he walks. The frightened ARYA moves from shelf to shelf, silently keeping out of sight of the wights shambling in the aisles. She makes her way past half a dozen shelves before encountering a ghoul walking down the aisle toward her. She circles back. and pivots into an aisle to avoid another wight, pressing herself against the shelf. Yet another wight walks past on the other end of the aisle. ARYA quickly scampers across the open part of the room.
s08e03	The Long Night	Now on her hands and knees, blood droplets fall from her facial wounds. A wight seems to sense her, either from the sound of the droplets or the smell of the blood. ARYA can see the door that leads to safety. But the wight steps out of the aisle just in front of her. It crouches to the ground, looking for her with its blank eyes. But she is gone, pressed against a nearby bookshelf. ARYA picks up a book and tosses it down the aisle as a decoy. The wights snarl and take the bait, swarming to where the book landed. ARYA walks quietly behind them towards the door. She rounds a shelf and comes face-to-face with a formerly female wight. ARYA slips her dragon glass blade beneath the wight's chin, then removes it. The wight collapses onto her shoulder, thick black blood pouring from its chin and mouth. ARYA quietly lowers her to the ground, then walks out the door. Once on the other side, she silently uses her body weight to close it behind her.
s08e03	The Long Night	Her relief is interrupted by the growl of a nearby wight in the hallway. She cautiously takes some steps backward, trying to locate the undead creature. The volume rises as more creatures approach. Suddenly, a door behind her breaks apart, and wights start pouring into the darkened hallway. ARYA sprints away, pursued by ferocious wights. Panting, ARYA bumbles through the dark twists of the passageway. The ghouls pursue and close the gap between them. Gasping for breath, ARYA runs full tilt into a darkened passage.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE CRYPT
s08e03	The Long Night	Distant snarls echo through the crypt. The women and children look around nervously. VARYS looks at the stairwell leading to the crypt as the snarling sounds echo down.  TYRION takes a drink from his wineskin. A sudden clank surprises everyone. SANSA walks forward as soldiers begin to pound on the distant door to the crypt. The growls of wights are equally loud.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 1: Open the door!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 2: Open the door!
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 3: Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	The soldiers begin to scream in pain.
s08e03	The Long Night	SOLDIER 4: Open the door! Open the door! Please! Open it!
s08e03	The Long Night	The screaming continues, then fades. Like the rest of those hiding in the crypt, SANSA returns the silence.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: A PASSAGEWAY
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND and BERIC inch though the dark passage, weapons ready. BERIC's flaming sword lights the way. Wights snarl in the distance. They approach each corner with great caution. A door at the end of the hallway crashes down, two grappling figures following it to the floor. A snarling wight assaults the desperate ARYA, who screams and grunts as she fend him off. BERIC throws his flaming sword down the length of the hall, spinning end over end. It pierces the ghoul, throwing the wight off ARYA.
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND battles with the wights pouring into the hallway as BERIC pulls ARYA to her feet. A prone wight stabs BERIC in the ankle and he grunts in pain. ARYA runs and BERIC limps after her, while the HOUND clears their path. The slow-moving BERIC kicks and fights with the wights who catch up to him. ARYA reaches the HOUND, and he pulls her along.
s08e03	The Long Night	HOUND: Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC: Go!
s08e03	The Long Night	HOUND: Come on!
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC stops to hold off the advancing wights. ARYA looks back with dismay.
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC: Run!
s08e03	The Long Night	Attracted to the sounds of battle, wights shamble out from many nearby passages. The HOUND clears the way while ARYA pulls BERIC behind her. He surges ahead to pin a wight against the wall.  Other wights crash into them. One of the ghouls stabs BERIC in the gut with a dagger. ARYA picks up an axe to come to BERIC's aid. Nearby, the HOUND fells another wight, then looks up to see a mass of undead hustling down the hallway. He retreats back to his companions. ARYA helps the cowering BERIC to fight of the wights that grapple him. The HOUND picks her up from behind and carries her away. She resists.
s08e03	The Long Night	HOUND: We've gotta go!
s08e03	The Long Night	BERIC starts to follow, but the wights lying around him stab and grab his legs. He braces himself in pain. The HOUND and ARYA run, pursued by a horde of undead. The wights around BERIC stab and stab again. His energy starts to flag, but he breaks free and staggers away.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GREAT HALL
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND and ARYA burst through a door. BERIC staggers in behind them. He falls to the floor as they and slam the door behind them and hold it fast. ARYA props up BERIC against the wall while the HOUND barricades the door with a chair and a large wooden bench. The light fades from BERIC's eyes. ARYA looks at him pleadingly.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: The Lord brought him back for a purpose. Now that purpose has been served.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE stands by the fireplace.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA: I know you.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE walks towards ARYA.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: And I know you.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA. stands to face MELISANDRE
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA: You said we'd meet again.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: And here we are. At the end of the world.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA: You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: Brown eyes... green eyes... and blue eyes.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA nods as MELISANDRE lists the eye colors. MELISANDRE gives an almost imperceptable smile.
s08e03	The Long Night	Wights snarl and crash against the door.
s08e03	The Long Night	MELISANDRE: What do we say to the God of Death?
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA: Not today.
s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA looks at MELISANDRE and then the HOUND. She jogs away from her companions, and they watch her go.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON hears the wights snarling in the distance.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON: Here they come!
s08e03	The Long Night	The soldiers ready their bows. Shadows streak through the snow-covered trees.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON: Steady, lads.
s08e03	The Long Night	Soldiers grab arrows and set them aflame. They ready their bows.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON: Steady now. Make every shot count.
s08e03	The Long Night	Shadows flit among the trees.
s08e03	The Long Night	MAN 1: Over there!
s08e03	The Long Night	The snarling grows louder and the wights charge out of the woods, frenzied and in great numbers.
s08e03	The Long Night	MAN 2: There!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE
s08e03	The Long Night	Winterfell is surrounded by a moat of fire. Great swaths of field continue to burn where DROGON laid waste to the undead. The NIGHT KING and VISIERION swoop down. The dragon expels powerful blue flame that destroys a great turret of the city wall and they speed across. The NIGHT KING looks backward to savor the damage, allowing JON and RHAEGAL to intercept them. RHAEGAL clutches VISIERION in his claws, and the two dragons engage in a mid-air melee of claws and fangs.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON and the Northern soldiers unleash their arrows at the charging wights. Just above them, RHAEGAL and the undead VISIERION battle and roar, flying jerkily towards the earth. TheY bite and rake one another with massive claws, slicing great wounds into each other.
s08e03	The Long Night	JON: Get off!
s08e03	The Long Night	VISIERION clamps his jaws on the neck of RHAEGAL and sinks his teeth in. JON struggles to hold on. The NIGHT KING readies a javelin. VISIERION rips his jaws away, blue flame boiling in his mouth. He bites at JON, who twists to evade the massive maw. Plumes of blue flame puff from VISIERION as the dragon continues to snap and bite. Entangled, the dragons spiral downward. Then DROGON sweeps in, taking VISIERION in his claws as he flies past. The NIGHT KING falls from his perch atop VISIERION and plummets to the ground. JON holds onto RHAEGAL for dear life. DROGON chomps deeply into the neck of the undead VISIERION with a sickening crunch. Meanwhile, RHAEGAL reaches the ground with incredible speed and force and tries to transition from flying to running. The velocity is too great however, and the dragon ends up sliding on its belly, throwing JON to the ground. JON gathers himself, groaning and panting. DROGON roars above him, with DAENERYS riding assuredly astride him.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	The courtyard is strewn with piles of bodies. TORMUND. GENDRY, and JORAH fight on. DROGON roars above them. JORAH reacts, drawn to help DAENERYS.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ABOVE THE BATTLE.
s08e03	The Long Night	DROGON hovers above Winterfell. DAENERYS looks down at  the NIGHT KING. He stands in a field below them, looking up and seemingly unharmed by his fall.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS: Dracarys.
s08e03	The Long Night	DROGON belches forth a column of flame that envelops the stoic NIGHT KING. DAENERYS looks down with vindication at the massive fireball. Just below them, JON limps towards the conflagration. DROGON ceases his attack and DAENERYS watches as the fire dissipates. JON gets as close as the heat will let him. DROGON squawks. The flames start to clear, revealing the NIGHT KING - confident, unhurt, and unphased. He stares up at DAENERYS, smirking at his invulnerability. DAENERYS is stunned. The NIGHT KING picks up the javelin beside him. DAENERYS immediately spurs DROGON to flee. The NIGHT KING hurls the javelin at the receding pair, which misses by inches.
s08e03	The Long Night	Satisfied, the NIGHT KING strides through the smoldering grounds towards the godswood. JON draws Longclaw and sets after the NIGHT KING at a brisk run. The NIGHT KING walks calmly toward his intended target, but is quickly alerted to JON's pursuit of him by the sound of JON's footprints among the burning cinders. The NIGHT KING turns to look at him and JON pauses. The NIGHT KING plants his feet and spreads his hands, beginning a silent invocation. JON sets off towards him at a sprint, but has too much ground to cover. The eyes of the undead soldiers between them open, a vacant milky blue. JON runs faster. Still fifty yards away, the slain soldiers sit up, then stand. JON gets within ten yards of the NIGHT KING before the newly risen wights block his progress completely. JON looks behind him to see scores of soldiers resurrected as undead warriors.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	TORMUND and JAIME continue to fight the undead, yelling and grunting as they dispatch their foes. JAIME pauses, astounded as the slain soldiers in Winterfell rise to their feet. GREY WORM pants for breath as the new undead rise in near silence, looking on in horror with SAM. Nearby, TORMUND and GENDRY do the same. The wind whistles and the undead clumsily take their feet. Nearby, the eyes of LYANNA MORMONT pop open, showing milky blue irises, piercing and lifeless. QHONO and EDD join the ranks of the undead.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE FIELD
s08e03	The Long Night	The NIGHT KING stands motionless and menacing. JON gasps for breath. The NIGHT KING turns his back to JON and walks away. Meanwhile, the crowd of the undead closes in slowly around JON. With no other option, he hacks at the undead that surround him.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	The undead continue to rise in the courtyard. Just beyond the wall, a score of White Walkers strut towards the gate, weapons drawn.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE CRYPT
s08e03	The Long Night	GILLY hears rustling and scratching behind her. She turns her head and gasps when a skeletal hand breaks through the wall of the crypt. A dried up corpse twists out its tomb and wriggles onto the floor, snarling.  TYRION and SANSA look up at the disturbance. GILLY rises to investigate, as does SANSA. LITTLE SAM cries. The emaciated corpse gets to its feet. VARYS jumps up.
s08e03	The Long Night	Behind the crowd, another wall starts to crumble. People stand and begin to scream in panic. Another Stark ancestor wriggles out of its tomb. The women and children flee to another part of the crypt.
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION: Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!
s08e03	The Long Night	One woman falls in the panic, and is dragged backward into the dark catacomb.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON and the Northern soldiers expertly take down the charging wights with flaming arrows. They are successfully fending off the onslaught, but the wights are getting dangerously close. BRAN continues to warg with the crows and sits motionless in his chair.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE FIELD
s08e03	The Long Night	JON parries the lumbering undead that threaten to surround him, vastly overwhelmed by the growing swarm. Suddenly, a wall of fire ignites just behind JON,  consuming the wights. JON ducks and shields himself from the heat.  The wights shriek and chitter as they collapse and die in the inferno. JON catches his breath and looks up to see DAENERYS and DROGON hovering above. The mighty dragon continues to spew forth hits flame breath. JON squints as he peers into the destruction of the flames. DROGON lands down heavily behind him and roars.
s08e03	The Long Night	JON: Bran!
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS: Go!
s08e03	The Long Night	JON runs towards Winterfell, tracing a path through the walls of flame that still burn. Behind DROGON, more undead run at full tilt. DAENERYS, watching JON make his way to Winterfell, doesn't see the new assault until they are leaping on her dragon. They swarm on DROGON's tail and flanks. The dragon shakes and whips most of them off, but those that hang on stab mercilessly into DROGON'S hide. The dragon roars and screeches as the frantic stabbing continues. DAENERYS grunts as she tries to stay on DROGON in spite of his contortions. She is thrown to the ground as the wights continue to swarm over DROGON. The dragon labors and takes flight, undulating with great effort. The swarm of undead soldiers loses their grip as DROGON flies higher.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS watches as wights crash into the ground in front of her. They are bloodied and broken, but unphased by the traumatic wounds. They snap their attention onto DAENERYS. She crab walks backward in fear. One gruesome, pale wight charges her,  but is decapitated by JORAH at the last second. He grabs DAENERYS and leads her away.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: WINTERFEL COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	JON has reached the courtyard. A constant stream of bodies pours down from the parapets above. JON struggles to walk through the mounds of bodies that cover the courtyard. He passes GENDRY and TORMUND, who continue to battle the horde of undead. JON staggers onward and passes SAM who lies propped against another mound of bodies, frenetically stabbing the undead who cling to him. JON hacks through an attacking wight, and looks backwards as SAM screams, desperate and panicked. JON turns his back on his friend and continues forward, meeting more wight attacks. GREY WORM twirls his spear in a deadly whirlwind of precision. BRIENNE releases guttural grunts and screams as she hews through her foes. She is dangerously close to being overwhelmed, but JON does not pause.
s08e03	The Long Night	JON enters a passageway, where the battle continues in close quarters. He dispatches those that try to stop them, and dodges falling debris. He stumbles, buried momentarily, but regains his feet and lurches through an iron gate that he slams shut behind him. Undead soldiers slam against the grate, hissing and grabbing at JON. The gate holds fast, and JON launches away further down the hall.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON pants as he takes a few paces backward, notches a flaming arrow, and fires. He readies another arrow, but the wights are starting to get the upper hand, tackling the Northerners and encroaching on BRAN, who continues to sit helpless while warging. THEON reaches for another arrow, but his bucket is empty. He bats down one wight with his bow, but is tackled by another. He squirms away, as the wight charges again. THEON yells as he raises a spear that impales the oncoming ghoul. THEON stands and leverages the wight away from BRAN. He switches to hand-to-hand combat with the spear.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE FIELD
s08e03	The Long Night	JORAH leads DAENERYS through the burning wreckage of the battlefield outside the walls of Winterfell. He chops down an undead Dothraki. DAENERYS picks up a sword she sees on the ground. JORAH gores another two wights and the undead start to run at them from all sides.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE CRYPT
s08e03	The Long Night	The reanimated Stark ancestors hiss and shriek as they attack those in the crypt. Women scream as they are clawed and chewed by the desiccated undead. TYRION pokes his head out from behind the tomb where he and SANSA are hiding.  SANSA is overwhelmed, panting as she listens to the screams of her people. TYRION keeps peeking around the tomb, scheming for some opportunity to improve their situation. He and SANSA catch one another's eye, and she regains her focus. She pulls out her dragonglass knife. They exchange a long and affectionate look. TYRION pulls her gloved hand to his lips and kisses it. He gives a quick smile. He exhales sharply and turns quickly around the side of the tomb.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	JON continues his progress towards the godswood. VISIERION roars above him and JON looks up and spins, trying to locate the dragon. VISIERION lands atop the gate in front of him and belches forth blue fire. JON ducks reflexively at the impact. VISIERION turns his fire breath into the courtyard and JON flees back the way he came, barely escaping the torrent of blue flame that blasts down the hallway.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD

s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS: Jorah!
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE CRYPT
s08e03	The Long Night	Women and children try to flee the reanimated Starks corpses. SANSA swivels to take a look. TYRION seizes his moment and makes a break across the chamber, followed by SANSA. He reaches an alcove where VARYS and some others have taken refuge. He looks for his next opportunity.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE SIDE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	JON is pressed against a wall, panting and exhausted. As he peers around the corner, a mass of battling wights pours into the far passage as the gate gives way. JON runs back into the courtyard where VISIERION sits atop the wall. Fires burn everywhere and the undead dragon roars and shifts, causing further destruction . The dragon slides down into the courtyard itself. JON slays a wight, and turns to run as VISIERION unleashes a vortex blue flame at JON. He turns a corner to escape the attack, and presses himself against the wall.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON fights with all he has, slaying wights as they set upon him. BRAN continues to warg. The NIGHT KING has reached the godswood, and walks calmly towards BRAN, leading a procession of White Walkers.

s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	The NIGHT KING and the White Walkers stride through the godswood. THEON lands one mortal blow after another to keep the charging wights away from BRAN. He pauses, doubled over, exhausted and gasping for breath. The wights stop their attack and stand motionless. They part to allow the NIGHT KING to walk through. BRAN returns to consciousness. THEON looks at the NIGHT KING, who stands motionless amid his followers.
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN: Theon.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON turns to look at BRAN.
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN: You're a good man.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON: (Nods.)
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN: Thank you.
s08e03	The Long Night	THEON takes a breath. A single tear falls from his eye, and he looks down. He turns back to face the NIGHT KING and gives the slightest of nods at his foe. The NIGHT KING takes a step forward.  THEON readies his spear, then charges the NIGHT KING with a battle yell. THEON runs the length of the clearing at full tilt. In a single motion, the NIGHT KING side steps THEON's attack, grabs the spear, breaks it in two, and impales THEON through the gut. THEON grunts, looks up at the NIGHT KING's expressionless face, and falls quivering to his knees. The NIGHT KING shifts his gaze to BRAN. THEON falls and BRAN looks down.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE SIDE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	JON remains pinned behind a wall as VISIERION spurts blue flame in the courtyard where he crouches. JON tries to dart past him, but VISIERION turns and blasts forth blue flame. JON scampers behind a ruined wall, and lies prone, trapped by the blue incineration above.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD

s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	The NIGHT KING draws closer. BRAN does not look at him as he closes the final steps to his wheelchair. The NIGHT KING stops just next to BRAN's chair. BRAN turns his head and looks up. Their eyes meet and they ponder one another. The NIGHT KING cocks his head slightly.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE SIDE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	VISIERION's head is just on the other side of the broken wall where JON lies hiding. JON steels himself and stands up, facing the dragon, hands and sword at his side. He yells out a challenging cry. VISIERION opens his great jaws to unleash a blast to rip JON apart.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GODSWOOD
s08e03	The Long Night	BRAN and the NIGHT KING calmly look eye-to-eye. The NIGHT KING reaches back to unsheathe his weapon from its shoulder scabbard. A faint wind moves the hair of a nearby White Walker. As the NIGHT KING is about the grab the hilt of his sword, ARYA appears, leaping through the darkness at the NIGHT KING's back. Her scream gives her away and the NIGHT KING swivels around, grabbing her by the throat with one hand and staying her knife hand with the other. ARYA drops her knife, made of Valyrian steel, and the NIGHT KING's eyes follow its descent.  ARYA catches the knife in her free right hand and buries it in the NIGHT KING's stomach with a grunt. The NIGHT KING shatters into tiny ice shards, which rain down where he once stood. ARYA lands crouching on her hands and feet, panting.
s08e03	The Long Night	One by one, the White Walkers explode into ice shards. The crowd of wights that surround BRAN and AYRA fall over, lifeless as rag dolls.

s08e03	The Long Night	JON stares in disbelief.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e03	The Long Night	TORMUND, GENDRY, and GREY WORM are stunned. They look out at the lifeless mounds of friend and foe. Nearby, BRIENNE, JAIME, and PODRICK, lean against the wall, dumbfounded at their sudden escape from certain death.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE CRYPT
s08e03	The Long Night	TYRION and SANSA stand motionless. VARYS walks up from behind, leading women and children to join them. GILLY stands with LITTLE SAM. The undead have turned into piles of dust and bone fragments.

s08e03	The Long Night	ARYA looks out from the weirwoord. A gentle snow falls. She looks back at BRAN. He looks back, pleased.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: The field.
s08e03	The Long Night	DAENERYS sobs over JORAH's listless body. He tries to say something, but goes still, eyes glazed by death. As she sobs, DROGON curls loosely around her to comfort her.
s08e03	The Long Night	CUT TO: THE GATE
s08e03	The Long Night	The HOUND comes out of the darkened doorway, followed by MELISANDRE. The HOUND stops, bent over in relief, but MELISANDRE continues, walking out the gate and down a snowy aisle flanked by piles of the dead. DAVOS appears at the gate and watches her walk towards the snowy field beyond. As she walks, she first sheds her red cloak, then her metal choker. Her gait becomes unsteady and her hair turns from red to white. Her dress slides off her shoulders as she shrinks, aging countless years in seconds. She gives off a cloud of dust as she collapses into an emaciated and lifeless pile.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL, DAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JORAH MORMONT's body lies on an unlit funeral pyre. DAENERYS TARGARYEN mourns over his prone body. She leans down and kisses him gently on the forehead. She then whispers something in his ear.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA STARK weeps over THEON GREYJOY’s dead body, her hand on his chest. She steps back, takes a Stark direwolf pin from her chest, and secures it on THEON's.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON SNOW, ARYA STARK, SAMWELL TARLY, and BRAN STARK stand amidst the Stark men, some of whom bear torches. DAENERYS joins the crowd a bit further down, next to GREY WORM, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and TYRION LANNISTER. In front of the crowd are scores of funeral pyres in a grid. Stark soldiers stand at intervals with more torches. SANSA returns to the somber crowd, joining her siblings. Even GHOST stands obediently in mourning. JON steps forward to address those assembled.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Soldiers and Free Folk hand torches to JON, SANSA, ARYA, SAM, TORMUND GIANTSBANE, DAENERYS, and GREY WORM. They fan out to various pyres in the field, joining their fallen comrades for one final farewell: ARYA to BERIC DONDARRION, SAM to EDDISON TOLLETT, JON to LYANNA MORMONT. JON looks at DAENERYS. As one, they ignite the pyres. DAENYRYS watches the flames spread under JORAH, then turns away. The living return to the crowd and the flames rise higher. The air fills with a thick black smoke.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: WINTERFELL GREAT HALL
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The victory feast is somber and quiet, even though the hall is filled to capacity. At the head table sits BRAN, SANSA, JON, DAENERYS, and TYRION.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN: To your health.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	In the crowd, GENDRY looks around. He turns back to the table where SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE eats hungrily. GENDRY takes a drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: Have you seen Arya?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: You can still smell the burning bodies, and that’s where your head is at.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: I just want to thank her for-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: I'm sure you do.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: Look, it's not about that.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND takes a deep gulp of his wine. GENDRY gets up, insulted. He walks the length of the hall to exit, but DAENERYS notices him as he passes the head table.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Gendry.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY stops and faces her. The hall goes even quieter.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: That's right, isn't it?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY approaches DAENERYS.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: Yes, Your Grace.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: You’re Robert Baratheon’s son.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: (nods)
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: I didn’t even know he was my father until after he was dead.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: I don’t know, Your Grace.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Does anyone?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	No one in the hall responds.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS:I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The crowd murmurs.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: I can't be. I'm a bastard.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The newly named GENDRY BARATHEON nods in shock and surprise. At a nearby table, DAVOS stands and raises his glass.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS: To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Everyone in the hall rises to their feet to salute GENDRY.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ALL: To Gendry!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 1: Lord Gendry!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 2: Gendry!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 3: Gendry!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 4: Gendry!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY takes a goblet from the smiling JON SNOW.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 5: Lord Gendry!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY salutes the hall. They cheer in response.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 6: Gendry!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND, still sitting, shakes his head and returns to shoveling food into his mouth. The hall contiunes to cheer.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 7: That's easy, isn't it?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION; A fitting reward for a hero.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SAM: (to GENDRY) Uh, hold on.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 8: (to GENDRY) Come, my lord.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS:  See? You're not the only one who's clever.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA looks at DAENERYS with concern, pondering the play that the Mother of Dragons has just made.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	WOMAN: I have to go down and get another barrel.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: WINTERFELL GREAT HALL, LATER
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The mood has lightened. The merry crowd laughs and enjoys themselves. The wine flows freely. A server places a carafe of wine on the table in front of BRIENNE and JAIME. BRIENNE covers the top of her goblet but JAIME removes her hand.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME pours wine for BRIENNE and himself. BRIENNE watches, a bit nervous. They clink glasses and drink together.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS and TYRION stand talking about MELISANDRE.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS: The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  I'm sure you had your reasons.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS:  I did. I do.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:   So did you?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS: Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS: And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS:  Thank you. I feel much better.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS takes the wine that TYRION has poured for him and drinks. TYRION exits.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE HOUND'S TABLE
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The celebrations are becoming raucous. THE HOUND takes  the entire pitcher of wine from a serving wench  as she passes.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION looks into the fire, pensively.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN: More ale!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION address BRAN, who sits nearby.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRAN: It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRAN: I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRAN doesn't answer.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You don't want it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRAN: I don't really want anymore.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I envy you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRAN looks turns to look behind him at MAESTER WOLKAN.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRAN: You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAESTER WOLKAN steps up behind BRAN's chair and starts wheeling him away."
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE HEAD TABLE
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND goads JON into drinking from his horn.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: All of it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN: Go on.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON:  No, not in one go.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Go on. I believe in you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: We have to celebrate our victory.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: Vomiting is not celebrating.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: Yes, it is.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Everyone laughs. TORMUND holds up the drinking horn in salute.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: Ah! To the Dragon Queen!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Everyone in the hall cheers. DAENERYS stands.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Everyone stands and cheers again, even louder. Only THE HOUND remains seated in disdain for the celebration.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ALL: Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	WOMAN: Drink!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND tips the great horn back and drinks for an inordinately long time.  He roars. JON and SANSA smile. SANSA watches DAENERYS again, then stands and exits.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: I'm fine!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS returns to her seat, sitting alone while TORMUND continues to spur on the drunken revelry nearby. The hall is abuzz with merriment.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: A NEARBY TABLE
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE, and PODRICK are playing TYRION's drinking game.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: (drunkenly) Your turn.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: (to BRIENNE) Um, You are an only child.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: I told you I was.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME:  You didn't.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: I did.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: I surmised it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Humorously scoffing, BRIENNE drinks.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Go again.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: Why does he get to go again?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Because it's my game.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: You have danced with Renly Baratheon.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE looks accusingly at PODRICK.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	PODRICK: (to Brienne) No.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE HEAD TABLE
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND is quite drunk and vociferous as he celebrates with JON, DAVOS, and some Free Folk.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN: The other way around!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: I saw him riding that thing.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS:  We all did.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND:  No. No. I saw him riding that thing.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON, sitting behind him, shakes his head and laughs. He takes another drink as he listens.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS:  That's right, you did.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: I did. That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Sitting just beyond the group, DAENERYS notices the praise that JON is getting. She watches closely. TORMUND  puts his hand of JON's shoulder with drunken affection. He then throws his arm around JON's shoulder.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: (laughing) He's little but he's strong. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAERNERYS continues to jealously observe the adulation that JON receives. A coffee cup rests on the table next to her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND firmly slaps JON on the back. JON winces in pain.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: Not this one.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The men laugh.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting. Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS grows more unhappy with the praise and attention that JON is getting.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The crowd cheers. JON looks at DAENERYS. She toasts him with her glass. TORMUND continues to laugh as DAENERYS looks around the room, with VARYS standing in the wings behind her. She looks over at the table where the drinking game is being played by TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE, and PODRICK.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME:  Drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	PODRICK: Drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE drinks. They all laugh.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS looks back at JON and TORMUND, feeling let out. She stands quickly. VARYS stands in response. As she exits, VARYS bows to her, then watches her go with concern.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE DRINKING GAME
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE, and PODRICK are deep in their cups.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE and TYRION laugh. TYRION drinks.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Mm!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: You were married. Before Sansa.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME:  Drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION growls and drinks.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: No!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION laughs drunkenly, and BRIENNE drinks, smiling. TYRION stares at BRIENNE as he prepares his next guess in their game, his face suddenly very serious.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You're a virgin.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE's face falls. PODRICK drinks nervously. JAIME tries to save the mood.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: That's a statement about the present.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or a woman.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE goes from flabbergasted to angry in the course a moment. She stands.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: I have to piss.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND approaches them
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: We did it! We faced those icy fucks. Looked right into their blue eyes, and here we are. Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND guffaws.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: Please pardon me for a moment.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE exits, and the drunken TORMUND moves to follow. JAIME stands quickly and blocks him. They exchange a look. JAIME jovially pats TORMUND on the shoulder to stay him, then turns to follow BRIENNE. Wounded, TORMUND watches BRIENNE leave, tailed by JAIME. TYRION gets his attention by pouring his wine into TORMUND's drinking horn.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN: Drink it!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION's eyes hold TORMUND's gaze as he  clinks his glass with the drinking horn. He exits and PODRICK smirks. TORMUND digests the reality of the situation. He returns to his Free Folk friends. PODRICK watches him go, and his eyes meet those of a Stark maiden, who smiles at him. He smiles back.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE GREAT HALL, LATER
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND, confessional and teary, pours his heart out to THE HOUND.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: And after all that, this fucker comes north and takes her from me. Just takes her, like that. I mean it, Clegane. My heart is broken.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND clasps THE HOUND's shoulder.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: Don't touch me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	WILLA: You can touch me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND swivels quickly to find WILLA and SARRA standing nearby.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	WILLA: I'm not afraid of wildlings.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: Maybe you should be.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA watches their interaction from afar. TORMUND chuckles and hugs WILLA close to him
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: Well, Clegane, it's time to drown our sorrows.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: I'm not done with my drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND sighs and grabs the pitcher from WILLA. He sets it down on a nearby table. They exit.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 2: You saved the day.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 1: You owe me one.  Don't forget that.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 2: For the rest of my days.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	While THE HOUND drains his glass and plunks it on the table, SARRA walks to the other side of him and sits.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SARRA: Are you ready now?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND grabs a large pitcher from the table in front of him and refills his glass.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	HOUND: This is my drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SARRA looks across the room to SANSA. She tries to re-engage THE HOUND, but he lurches aggressively at her, growling. SARRA recoils, then exits quickly
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN: All right!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA approaches THE HOUND and sits down across from him.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: She could have made you happy, for a little while.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: There's only one thing that'll make me happy.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: And what's that?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: That's my fucking business.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA returns his brush off with silence.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: Used to be you couldn't look at me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: That was a long time ago. I've seen much worse than you since then.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: Yes, I've heard. Heard you were broken in. Heard you were broken in rough.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: And he got what he deserved. I gave it to him.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: How?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Hounds.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND chuckles.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: You've changed, Little Bird.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND takes a deep drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: None of it would have happened if you'd left King's Landing with me. No Littlefinger, no Ramsay none of it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA clasps his hand, gently. He looks down at the kindness, then back at her eyes.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA gathers herself, stands and exits. THE HOUND ponders.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The rowdiness continues to increase, as the party spills out into the courtyard
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 1: Hey!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 2: Pour another one.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY searches for ARYA. He enters a passageway away from the festivities. He is startled by an arrow that pierces the wall just in front of his face. He turns to see ARYA holding the bow. He raises both hands in surrender, and enters.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: Don't shoot.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA notches another bow.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating. You should be celebrating with them.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: I am celebrating.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	She launches the arrow at a makeshift target tacked to a barrel. She picks up another arrow.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: Yeah, I am too. I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore. I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. By order of the queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: Congratulations.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY grabs her quickly and kisses her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: I don't know how to be lord of anything. I hardly know how to use a fork. All I know is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if you're not with me. So be with me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY kneels before ARYA
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GENDRY: Be my wife. Be the Lady of Storm's End.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA bends down and kisses GENDRY. They stand together.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you. But I'm not a lady. I never have been. That's not me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA readies another arrow, and lets it fly.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE adds a log to the fire burning in the hearth. There is a knock on the door. BRIENNE walks over and opens it. JAIME stands at, leaning drunkenly against the wall.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: You didn't drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME invites himself in. He places a pitcher on the table, and grabs the two glasses nestled the elbow of his right arm. BRIENNE is a bit confused, but she closes the door and walks over.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: I didn't drink?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: In the game.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE:  I drank.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME picks up the pitcher to pour a glass of wine.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: In the game. This is Dornish.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE:  This is not the game. This is only drinking.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME hands her a full glass.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: Suit yourself.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE drinks, a puzzled look on her face.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: You keep it warm enough in here.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME slides off his jacket with a bit of difficulty and throws it down on the table.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North. Keep your fire going. Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: That's very diligent. Very responsible.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: Piss off.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: It grows on you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: I don't want things growing on me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME fills the other glass with a sloppy pour.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME drinks. BRIENNE's expression softens.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: (almost whispering) You sound quite jealous.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: (nods) I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME works to undo the lacing of his shirt, but struggles to do so one-handed. He chuckles in embarrassment at his ineptitude. He tries using his left hand and his teeth. BRIENNE realizes that this is a drunken seduction. She swats his hand away.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: Oh, move aside.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE undoes JAIME's shirt. He starts doing the same for her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE:  What are you doing?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: I'm taking your shirt off.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	They both pause and look at one another. BRIENNE undoes her own shirt as he watches. She helps JAIME pull his shirt over his head. She then peels off her own shirt.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: I've never slept with a knight before.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: I've never slept with anyone before.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: I told you-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME cuts her short with a hungry kiss. She returns in kind.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON sits on the edge of his bed, his head propped up on one fist, tired and drunk. DAENERYS opens the door and enters.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Are you drunk?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON looks at her for a beat.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: No.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON stands and stumbles a bit. He laughs at himself.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: Only a little.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS shuts the door and moves closer.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I didn't know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: He loved me. And I couldn't love him back. Not the way he wanted. Not the way I love you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	They embrace.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Is that all right?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON and DAENERYS kiss, gently at first. Their passion builds and they start to undress one another while still kissing. JON pulls back, a conflicted look on his face. DAENERYS responds with dejection. JON moves away.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: I wish you'd never told me. If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	She sits.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I told you I don't want it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: (angrily) It doesn't matter what you want. You didn't want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON kneels before her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I'll refuse. You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS quickly takes JON's face in her hands and looks him straight in the eye.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: (desperately) You can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON stands. DAENERYS takes his hand in hers.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: I want it to be the way it was between us.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON returns her touch.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I have to tell Sansa and Arya.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: She won't.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: She's not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I owe them the truth.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Even if the truth destroys us?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: It won't.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: It will. I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you. Don't do this. Please.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON cups her face in his hands.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: You are my queen. Nothing will change that. And they are my family. We can live together.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS's face turns stony.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: We can. I've just told you how.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON lets his hands fall. DAENERYS walks away.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE and JAIME lie in bed, naked. BRIENNE is fast asleep. JAMIE looks at her, breathes deeply, then stares towards the ceiling.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The room contains a map of Westeros with stone pieces representing the forces at Winterfell and King's Landing. The war council consists of MISSANDEI, DAENERYS, VARYS, GREY WORM, TYRION, JON, ARYA, SANSA, QHONO, SAM, BRAN, MAESTER WOLKAN, DAVOS, and BRIENNE. The mood is somber and tense.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM picks up a handful of Winterfell markers.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM:  Half are gone.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: The Northmen as well.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON slides of some other markers. MAESTER WOLKAN slides away some more. VARYS places additional markers in King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI: When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS pauses and thinks before responding.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: All right.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: The men we have left are exhausted. Many of them are wounded. They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: How long do you suggest?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: It's not just our people. It's yours. You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: (to SANSA and ARYA) The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON turns to face DAENERYS.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: What you command, we will obey.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA and SANSA exchange a glance.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON moves the corresponding markers on the map.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM moves those markers into position.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: We have won the Great War. Now we will win the Last War. In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Everyone exits, except for the Stark children. ARYA intercepts JON as he begins to leave. SANSA moves to stand beside BRAN.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: We need a word.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The Stark children discuss the situation in the godswood.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: You understand we'd all be dead if not for her. We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Arya's the one that killed the Night King.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: And we will never forget them. That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I swore myself and the North to her cause.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: I respect that.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: You respect it?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON:  You don't know her yet.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA:  I'll never know her. She's not one of us.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: That's all right. I don't need many allies.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: Arya-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: We're family. The four of us. The last of the Starks.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I've never been a Stark.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: You are. You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON hesitates.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRAN: It's your choice.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA and ARYA look to BRAN, confused.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I need to tell you something. But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: What is it?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: You have to swear it, before I tell you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: Because we're family. Swear it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: I swear it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: I swear it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: (to BRAN) Tell them.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA and ARYA turn to BRAN.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL HOUSE, NIGHT
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Two cloaked people walk by the modest house.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: WINTERFELL HOUSE
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME and TYRION talk by the fire.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: So she's going to stay here with you?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	They both laugh.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall person jokes? To climbing mountains.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION and JAIME clink their glasses in a toast.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: To climbing mountains.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	They drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: What's she like down there?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: What? That's not your concern.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: You're a dog.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I am the Imp, and I demand to know.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN enters. He cavalierly holds JOFFREY's crossbow
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you, what are you doing up North?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME motions to the crossbow.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: What are you doing with that?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You're supposed to be south.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN sits next to them.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: That's a bit rude.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, and what do I have to show?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You're a knight, thanks to me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blonde hair from your brother's ballsack.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: Power resides where men believe-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Shut your mouth.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I'm just trying-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN pivots in his seat and gives TYRION a left hook to the face. JAIME jerks to his feet. In a fluid motion, BRONN leans back and threatens JAIME with the crossbow
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION tips his head back and groans, holding his nose with both hands.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You broke my nose!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: I did not break your nose.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: How do you know?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME:  And you trust Cersei-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN picks up a cup of wine and drinks deeply.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: May I speak?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Why not? Only death will shut you up.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: Highgarden? Are you mad?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: It's better than being dead.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN unleashes a crossbow bolt just past JAIME's head. They both are taken by surprise and go silent at the threat. BRONN reloads.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN takes another drink.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN: Highgarden. Give me your word.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN; (chuckles)  Oh, no. No, my fighting days are done. But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me? I'll come find you when the war is done. Till then, don't die.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRONN stands up and backs out of the room, keeping the crossbow trained on the the Lannister brothers. He shuts the door behind him. JAIME and TYRION look to one another.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND rides though the gray and snowy landscape, chewing on jerky. He sees something in the distance.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: For fuck's sake.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA rides up next to him. Annoyed, THE HOUND throws his jerky on the ground .
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARAY: On your own?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	They ride side by side.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: Not anymore. I don't like crowds.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: Me neither.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: Why not? They all love you now. You're the big hero.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: Don't like heroes.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: I have some unfinished business.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: Me too.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: I don't plan on coming back.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA: Neither do I.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND: Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	ARYA:  Probably.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	THE HOUND laughs. ARYA smiles.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: HILLS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS pets the growling RHAEGAL, who then takes flight. DROGON and DAENERYS watch RHAEGAL take flight. DAENERYS smiles and turns to climb onto DROGON.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL WALKWAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA watches the dragons soar through the air. TYRION approaches.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  My lady.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Distracted by the flying dragons, SANSA does not answer.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: "My lord" is the standard response.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Why her?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You know she loves your brother.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Well, I suppose that's up to him.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Sansa, look at me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA takes her eyes off the dragons and slowly turns to look at TYRION.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: She's your queen too.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The Unsullied march in time out the main gate of Winterfell. SANSA and TYRION both turn to watch.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: You don't have to be her friend. But why provoke her? How is that in the best interest of your family, or the North, or-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: You're afraid of her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA gives a sigh and turns away. TYRION looks at her curiously.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Are you all right?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA mulls over the knowledge she has about JON's heritage.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION starts to walk away.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: Tyrion.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION stops and turns to look at SANSA.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: What if there's someone else? Someone better?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAVOS mounts his steed while JON packs his saddle. TORMUND approachs.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: You're not gonna ride the dragon south?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON shakes his head, amused. He walks to meet TORMUND halfway.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: (scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: (laughs)
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON looks at GHOST.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: So would you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: You never know.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND and JON hug.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND: You've got the North in you. The real North.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TORMUND exits. JON walks to meet SAM and GILLY. JON gives GILLY a hug, and is surprised by her baby bump. She looks at her belly, smiling. SAM nods to confirm that she is pregnant.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SAM: Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GILLY: I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: I hope it's a girl.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON and SAM hug, both of them holding back tears.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SAM: You're the best friend I ever had.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON: You too, Sam.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JON walks away. GHOST whines as he passes. JON mounts, and rides out of the gate with DAVOS. TORMUND, GHOST, SAM, and GILLY watch him go.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: THE OPEN SEA
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The Targaryen fleet sails at a fine clip. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI stand together on deck. MISSANDEI discreetly slips her hand into GREY WORM's. He looks down at their hands and they smile at one another.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION sits, talking with VARYS, who stands nearby.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Think of the past twenty years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: How many others know?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS sits.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Including us? Eight.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: He doesn't want the throne.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION begins to pace.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: (with distaste) She's his aunt.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: That never stopped a Targaryen before.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: I worry about her state of mind.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: DRAGONSTONE HARBOR
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	A ship drops anchor and another furls its sails, while other ships in the distance have already set anchor. RHAEGAL and DROGON fly overhead, with DAENERYS riding atop DROGON. They soar over the castle, enjoying themselves. Suddenly, a huge bolt pierces RHAEGAL's chest. He screeches in pain. DAENERYS is confused and distraught as RHAEGAL struggles to continue flying. Another bolt plunges into his chest, and a third pierces his neck. Blood spurts and the mighty dragon tumbles towards the sea.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE TARGARYEN FLEET
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION and VARYS race to the deck in time to see RHAEGAL plunge into the sea just off the side of their ship, upside down and unconscious. Men shout in confusion and race around the deck. RHAEGAL disappears below the churning foam.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE SKY ABOVE
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS looks down in horror. Another giant bolt zooms just above her head. She ducks in surprise, and looks to see the Ironborn fleet appear from behind the craggy shores of Blackwater. Several of QYBURN's scorpions have been mounted on their foredecks, one of which is manned by EURON. His crew repositions the huge siege weapon for another shot. Rage takes over DAENERYS as she guides DROGON to dive towards the Ironborn. She screams a war cry. EURON patiently waits for his shot. The Ironborn let loose a volley of bolts, forcing DAENERYS to veer away from her attack dive. DROGON escapes unscathed, tailed by bolts as he retreats. DAENERYS seeths.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE TARGARYEN FLEET
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI and TYRION watch DAENERYS fly away.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE SKY ABOVE
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS is consumed by fury. Then she lowers her head in mourning.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE IRONBORN FLEET
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURON watches DAENERYS fly away. He smiles and he and his men repositions their weapons towards the vulnerable Targaryen ships.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE TARGARYEN FLEET
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI runs to GREY WORM's side.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM: Get to the skiff.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI hesitates.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM: Now!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI retreats.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION takes stock of the attacking Ironborn ships, coming towards them at full sail.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SOLDIER 1: Spears!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SOLDIER 2: They're coming round again!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE IRONBORN FLEET
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURON takes aim with a menacing smile. He lets loose the bolt with a grunt. The other ships follow suit, sending off a brutal assault.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: THE TARGARYEN FLEET
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The volley of giant bolts takes apart the Targaryen ships. GREY WORM is knocked off his feet by the force of impact.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SOLDIER 3: Go!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SOLDIER 4: Clear!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SOLDIER 5: Man your stations!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI: No!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The sea spurts over the railings as the massive bolts destroy the hull. TYRION pivots away from the attacking side and is nearly impaled on a whistling bolt. He falls backwards with a grunt. He quickly swivels back to his feet and changes direction. Another bolt screams through the air in front of him and destroys the railing on the far side of the deck. TYRION tries to continue towards the stern of the ship, but the bolts continue relentlessly, causing devastation and carnage. With no other options, TYRION jumps overboard to escape.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SOLDIER 4: Go! Go!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SOLDIER 5: Clear!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION treads water. He looks up as a felled mast comes down on top of him. The screen goes black.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: THE SHORE OF BLACKWATER BAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Survivors of the Targaryen Fleet drag their comrades through the surf and onto the shore. They cough and gasp. VARYS and TYRION lie on the shore, VARYS coughing uncontrollably while TYRION pants. GREY WORM staggers to shore and desperately looks around.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM:  Missandei? Missandei!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM runs back into the water, his eyes scanning the waves.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM: Missandei!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	He dives into the water and swims out to search for her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI looks out into the courtyard of the Red Keep. A crowd files in through the main entrance from the city beyond.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI: Our message was well-received, then?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: Your people have heard the Usurper is coming. They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURON approaches.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI: You're certain about the dragon?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURION: I saw it sink beneath the waves.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI: That must have been glorious.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURON kneels before her.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURON: The glory is yours, my queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI strokes his face.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI: When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea, and our child shall one day rule them all.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURON rises, and looks to QYBURN, who nods, confirming CERSEI's pregnancy. Elated, EURON stokes CERSEI affectionately. She does not enjoy it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EURON: She's coming for you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI: Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI moves away from the window and walks past SER GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE, who guards MISSANDEI, hands shackled and weeping.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI: So much for "the Breaker of Chains."
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI, QYBURN, and EURON exit.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS lays down the lion figure on the war map.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: You saw my child fall from the sky.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: (nods)
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: They took Missandei.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS is silent.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS: Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	DAENERYS and GREY WORM exit.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS:  I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: And how do you know she wasn't?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION pours himself some wine.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: We're discussing treason.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: He could temper her worst impulses.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: You've always known my reasons.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Even if you know it's a mistake?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisers.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: So, what happens to her?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS looks at TYRION with a knowing lock, not putting into words the unspeakable. TYRION shakes his head.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  Please. Don't.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS: I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS exits.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	A man breaks coal in the busy courtyard.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 1: I'm just about to start it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	WOMAN 1: Good luck.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 2: Protect shell right up to the wall.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 1: All right, I'll put another one on it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 3: He's headed down to the cellar. I'll need a cart over here.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 4: That's it, thanks. Thank you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME enters the courtyard. He looks over at SANSA, BRIENNE, and MAESTER WOLKAN, who are engaged in conversation. WOLKAN exits one way and SANSA and BRIENNE leave in another. JAIME follows them.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	WOMAN 2: It's really heavy, mind you.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 5: We need some more water.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MAN 3: Take it down there!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME finds SANSA talking to BRIENNE.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: . . . as are the rest of her advisors.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME approaches them cautiously.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: What happened?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA and BRIENNE exchange a glance. SANSA nods, giving BRIENNE permission to tell JAIME the news.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA: I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister. Seems like I won't get the chance.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	SANSA exits. JAIME's face falls.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	INT: BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME sits awake and and fully dressed at the foot of the bed. BRIENNE lies sleeping. He tries to slip away quietly, but the sound of his exit wakes BRIENNE. She sits up, alarmed, looking for him.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME readies his horse for departure. BRIENNE approaches.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: Have you ever run away from a fight?
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE takes JAIME's face in her hands, pleading with him.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE: You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	BRIENNE inhales deeply, holding back her tears.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME: She's hateful. And so am I.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	JAIME turns and mounts his horse. BRIENNE sobs. JAIME rides away, leaving her alone with her tears.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	EXT: OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	VARYS, GREY WORM, DAENERYS, and TYRION stand in front of a phalanx of Unsullied soldiers. High above them, CERSEI, EURON, and THE MOUNTAIN look down upon them from atop the gate. MISSANDEI stands with them, shackled and frightened. They are flanked by a long line of scorpions that are loaded, manned, and ready. The small company of Unsullied are vastly outnumbered by the archers and soldiers of King's Landing. An Unsullied solder shouts and the company thump their spears to attention.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The gate rattles and QYBURN walks out. TYRION steps forward to meet him halfway between the gate and the Unsullied.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: My lord.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Qyburn, you're a rational man.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: Or so I flatter myself, my lord.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: Yes.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: No, it is not a pleasant sound.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: I- I don't want to hear it. Help me save this city.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Your queen.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION: Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	QYBURN: We understand nothing of the sort. Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable. Your armies are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan-
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Having heard enough, TYRION walks past QYBURN so that he can address CERSEI directly. As he approaches the wall, The Kingsguard respond to the thread.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CAPTAIN: Ready! Nock! Draw!
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	The scores of archers draw their bows back, aiming at TYRION. The Imp continues to approach until he is within shouting distance. Looking down on him with contempt, CERSEI raises her hand, ready to give the order to her soldiers. After a tense moment, she makes a fist and brings her arm gently to her side. Her men stand down. TYRION nods, grateful.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	TYRION:  I know you don't care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate them. But you're not a monster. I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI weighs his words. DAENERYS looks on, anxious and angry. CERSEI steps forward next to MISSANDEI and clutches her arm. In response, DAENERYS and GREY WORM move closer.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	CERSEI: (to MISSANEDEI) If you have any last words, now is the time.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI stares below for a moment and takes a few shuddering breaths before raising her eyes.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	MISSANDEI: Dracarys.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Horror and disbelief shows on the faces of DAENERYS and GREY WORM. TYRION mouths "No". CERSEI smiles cruelly. She looks to THE MOUNTAIN, who steps forward, drawing his great sword. He slices through MISSANDEI's neck in one sweeping cut. Her head and body fall from the top of the gate to the ground below. GREY WORM turns away, unable to watch. His face twitches and he breathes raggedly.
s08e04	The Last of the Starks	Atop the wall, CERSEI looks down, satisfied. EURON looks pleased. TYRION turns around, dejected. He looks at DAENERYS, who struggles to contain her anger. TYRION knows he has failed her. CERSEI savors her cruel moment. DAENERYS fumes and boils with fury as she walks away through the Unsullied.

s08e05	The Bells	INT: DRAGONSTONE, VARYS'S CHAMBERS
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS sits at an ornate desk, writing a letter about JON SNOW's true heritage. Only partially visible, it includes the phrases, "... is not the only Targaryen left, Rhaegar and Lyanna ..." and " ... their son lives still, hidden by Eddard Stark ... " and " ... he is the true heir to the Iron Throne ...". There is an knock on the door. VARYS discretely hides what he has been writing.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: Come in.
s08e05	The Bells	The door opens and MARTHA enters, sheepish.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: And?
s08e05	The Bells	MARTHA: (shakes her head)
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: Nothing?
s08e05	The Bells	MARTHA: She won't eat.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS taps the table rhythmically as he thinks.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: We'll try again at supper.
s08e05	The Bells	He returns to writing.
s08e05	The Bells	MARTHA: I think they're watching me.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: Who?
s08e05	The Bells	MARTHA:  Her soldiers.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: Of course they are. That's their job.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS extends his hand kindly. MARTHA comes closer and clasps hold.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: What have I told you, Martha?
s08e05	The Bells	MARTHA: The greater the risk, the greater the reward.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: (Nods.) Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
s08e05	The Bells	MARTHA exits.
s08e05	The Bells	EXT: DRAGONSTONE SHORE, BEACH OVERLOOK
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION LANNISTER stands above the beach, watching a boat being beached by its crew. JON walks from the boat to VARYS.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE BEACH
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: The Northern armies?
s08e05	The Bells	JON: Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
s08e05	The Bells	JON and VARYS walk inland.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: She shouldn't be alone.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: Aren't you worried for her?
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: We both know what she's about to do.
s08e05	The Bells	They pause. JON sighs.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: What do you want?
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
s08e05	The Bells	JON considers.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: I don't want it. I never have.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: (Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true: You will rule wisely and well, while she--
s08e05	The Bells	JON: She is my queen.
s08e05	The Bells	JON continues on, alone. VARYS sighs.

s08e05	The Bells	TYRION enters, stopping at the threshold.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Your Grace?
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS TARGARYEN does not reply. TYRION walks cautiously to DAENERYS, who stands, looking out at the shoreline.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: There's something you need to know.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Someone has betrayed me.
s08e05	The Bells	Surprised, TYRION does not answer right away.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Yes.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Jon Snow.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Varys.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: He knows the truth about Jon.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: He does.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: And Varys?
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: (angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: It was a mistake.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: She trusts me.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS does not reply.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: But it doesn't matter now.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: No. It doesn't matter now.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION takes measure of DAENERYS. She returns to her view of the landscape. She looks haggard and ill, more pale than ever with heavy bags under her eyes.
s08e05	The Bells	INT: VARYS'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS sits writing by candlelight. In the distance, a door opens. VARYS looks up and folds the scroll he was writing. He uses the candle to set it aflame, then snuffs the burning parchment. The sound of footsteps draw closer. VARYS removes his rings and places them in a small bowl. He sits, quietly resigned to his fate. The plodding of the approaching guards echo in the chamber. The door opens and GREY WORM enters, accompanied by a handful of Unsullied. He pauses and gives VARYS a menacing look.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE
s08e05	The Bells	GREY WORM and the Unsullied guards lead VARYS through the caverns by torchlight. They exit onto the rocky shore, passing an unhappy TYRION. DAENERYS stands in front of the surf with JON at her side. VARYS faces them, having accepted his fate. TYRION approaches from the side, and they exchange a knowing look.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: It was me.
s08e05	The Bells	VARYS: (Nods.) I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION and VARYS take in their good-bye. TYRION touches VARYS's shackled hands kindly, and steps away. VARYS fights to maintain his composure. DAENERYS steps forward.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...
s08e05	The Bells	From behind her, DROGON's head emerges from the darkness, growling.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: ... sentence you to die. Dracarys.
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON rears up behind DAENERYS and roars. Fright takes over VARYS's face. DROGON steadies himself, roars between his teeth, and quickly unleashes an inferno that consumes VARYS. TYRION watches, deeply sorrowful. JON stands quietly, willing himself to follow his queen.
s08e05	The Bells	INT: DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS sits by the fire, holding MISSANDEI's leather collar. GREY WORM stands at attention.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS hands the collar to GREY WORM. He looks it over, masking his pain, and throws it in the fireplace, where it shrivels and burns. At the sound of footsteps, GREY WORM regains his composure and turns to face JON as he enters. DAENERYS hides her sorrow as well.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.
s08e05	The Bells	GREY WORM nods and exits. JON approaches DAENERYS. There is an awkward silence.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
s08e05	The Bells	JON: I don't want it, and that's what I told him.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: I love you. And you will always be my queen.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS stands and walks to JON.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
s08e05	The Bells	They kiss. It is tentative at first, and then passion consumes them, until JON pulls away. He looks at her, deeply conflicted. DAENERYS shakes her head ever so slightly.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: All right, then.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS takes a step back.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS:  Let it be fear.
s08e05	The Bells	INT: DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS sits on the throne. TYRION and GREY WORM stand on the main floor, looking up at her.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION:  I beg you, my queen-
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION is silent and disappointed in her decision.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: (to GREY WORM) Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies.
s08e05	The Bells	Desperate, TYRION ascends the platform stairs to get closer to DAENERYS.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS considers TYRION's suggestion. She nods quietly to GREY WORM, accepting the plan.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
s08e05	The Bells	GREY WORM nods and then exits. TYRION and DAENERYS look at one another silently. Then TYRION slowly bows every so slightly, expressing his gratitude to his Queen. He turns and starts to walk away.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION stops and turns.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS:  It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION pivots and exits.
s08e05	The Bells	EXT: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY
s08e05	The Bells	The citizens of King's Landing chatter as they move into the protective walls of the Red Keep. They hold onto their loved ones and carry supplies on their backs or balanced on their heads. The guards help to keep them moving through the main entrance to the Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	GUARD 1: Let them pass.
s08e05	The Bells	GUARD 2: Through the gate.
s08e05	The Bells	GUARD 3: Get going.
s08e05	The Bells	EXT: THE SEAS OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY
s08e05	The Bells	JON and TYRION ride in a boat towards land. TYRION broods while JON is resigned. DAVOS waits for them on the shore below King's Landing, where their forces have made camp.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY
s08e05	The Bells	The camp is busy as the forces prepare for the upcoming battle. DAVOS, TYRION, and JON pause a few yards from the shore.
s08e05	The Bells	DAVOS: The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: She wants to attack now.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: Daybreak at the earliest.
s08e05	The Bells	JON turns to talk with some Stark soldiers.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Careful with that.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: My lord.
s08e05	The Bells	DAVOS turns to leave as well, but TYRION stays him.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?
s08e05	The Bells	DAVOS: I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?
s08e05	The Bells	EXT: THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: He's always better when he's got some food in him.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
s08e05	The Bells	The encampment has gone quiet for the night. Braziers light the camp at regular intervals. THE HOUND and ARYA STARK ride into camp. A SOLDIER stops them.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Ay up. Where you going?
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3 is confused.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: I need to go talk to my captain.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Go ahead, talk to him.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA and THE HOUND continue on their way.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Where's he going?
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION walks past the Unsullied warriors who line the path. An UNSULLIED gives him a questioning look.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: (speaking Valyrian) I drink to eat the skull keeper.
s08e05	The Bells	The UNSULLIED is unresponsive.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: (speaking Valyrian) I want to eat the skull keeper.
s08e05	The Bells	Again, the UNSULLIED gives no response. TYRION clears his throat and tries again.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: (struggling to speak Valyrian) I want to see the ...
s08e05	The Bells	UNSULLIED: We speak the common tongue.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
s08e05	The Bells	UNSULLIED: We have orders to guard the prisoner.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
s08e05	The Bells	UNSULLIED:  No.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.
s08e05	The Bells	The UNSULLIED looks to his comrades. They file away. TYRION enters the tent.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME LANNISTER sits, eyes closed, chained by his neck and hands. TYRION enters behind him,.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: How did they find you?
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME holds up his golden right hand as explanation.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Did you consider taking it off?
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister."
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: And you're going back to her, to die with her.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: You've underestimated her before.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Difficult to do from here.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION holds up the key to JAIME's chains. JAIME exhales heavily, impressed at this turn of events.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: The city will fall tomorrow.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Why?
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION moves closer to JAIME, and crouches to meet him, eye to eye.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME considers.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Swear to me.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: You have my word.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION unlocks JAIME's bonds.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: I'll try.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Your queen will execute you for this.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME gives an apprehensive look. TYRION stands quickly.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: You would have.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME starts to protest, but he is interrupted by TYRION's embrace. They hold one another tightly, aware this could be the last time they ever see each other. TYRION cries with an upwell of emotion. With a final look, TYRION exits quickly.
s08e05	The Bells	EXT: KING'S LANDING, MORNING
s08e05	The Bells	It is a quiet and beautiful morning. The Ironborn Fleet sits in the harbor, sails furled. The scorpions are fully manned in preparation for the coming onslaught. EUROON strides to the foredeck of his ship as the soldiers behind him load the scorpion. His eyes scan the far distance, looking for a sign of enemy forces.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Eyes on the horizon!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Load the scorpion!
s08e05	The Bells	On another ship, Lannister soldiers load a massive bolt onto their scorpion.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: OUTER WALL OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	Lannister archers hustle into position. Below them, city dwellers run towards the Red Keep for protection. Scorpions line the walls of King's Landing, loaded and ready.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Archers, close up!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 4: Up to the espringal!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 5: To the back of it!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 6: Archers, line up!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREET BELOW
s08e05	The Bells	A stream of citizens rushes anxiously towards the Red Keep. Lannister soldiers march double time in the opposite direction.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: This way! Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Clear the streets now!
s08e05	The Bells	Above the crowded street, citizen shutter their windows. Below people take shelter in their homes, one MAN grabbing his wife and picking up his child.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: No!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: In, now.  And you, come on.
s08e05	The Bells	More citizens rush through the streets as others shutter their windows.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Inside, now!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: Quickly.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2 directs the rushing citizens.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Yes. Follow down there. They're here. Get to the Red Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	In a doorway, a woman soothes her infant as the crowd hurries past and her daughters carry their belongings inside.
s08e05	The Bells	FATHER: My son!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Get inside!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: ANOTHER STREET
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA and THE HOUND walk calmly towards the Red Keep while anxious citizens stream around them. THE HOUND wears a hooded cloak to disguise his face.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Just ahead of you, I can see it!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: All right, move it!
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Keep moving!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Keep going!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Keep moving!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Quickly!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: All the way!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	FATHER: Hold your mother's hand!
s08e05	The Bells	Lannister soldiers move double time away from the Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: A DIFFERENT STREET
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME, cloaked and inconspicuous, removes the glove from his golden hand. He looks around.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 4: Make way for the Golden Company!
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME slides through the gate, down the center of a Golden Company battalion as they march in time.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 4: Close the gate!
s08e05	The Bells	The gates close with a great clanging. JAIME continues to walk quietly towards the Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	The Golden Company stands at attention. Some of their faces betray their trepidation towards the forthcoming battle. HARRY STRICKLAND guides his mount in front of them. His eyes are fixed on the distance, where the Stark forces stretch across the panorama.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY
s08e05	The Bells	The battered and snarling Northmen are crowded together. Behind them, the Dothraki and the Unsullied stand ready. On a rise just behind them stands JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM. TYRION joins them as men file past. GREY WORM walks down the rise. They look at the battlements and forces in the near distance.
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION: If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.
s08e05	The Bells	JON looks at TYRION with apprehension. He exits, followed by DAVOS.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Move along now, lads.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI LANNISTER walks to the window and surveys the great capital city. In the far distance is the wall where her loyal forces are stationed, and the great plain beyond where the Stark and Targaryen forces await. Behind her, QYBURN and SER GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE stand ready.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	Masses of city dwellers continue to move through courtyards, gates, and walls to the protection of the Red Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: That's it.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Go on, move it.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Come on, move, move. Faster, faster. Come on, move it. Keep going.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Keep moving.
s08e05	The Bells	The crowd chatters as they churn towards the gate. Among them, THE HOUND becomes frustrated at the slow pace. He grabs NORA by the shoulder and brushes past her. ARYA returns her shock with a stare as she follows THE HOUND through the gate.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Move.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Stay with him.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: Hold on.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Hold my hand.
s08e05	The Bells	Seizing the opportunity, NORA instructs her daughter, VICKY, to follow behind the THE HOUND and ARYA.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: Get behind there.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Close the gate! No more through!
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND picks up the pace to make it through before the gate seals. ARYA follows. People rush through, but the gate closes in front of NORA and VICKY.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: No!
s08e05	The Bells	VICKY:  No! Mommy!
s08e05	The Bells	NORA, VICKY, and the others pound desperately on the massive doors.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: Vicky! Please!
s08e05	The Bells	VICKY: No, please, sir!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: Open the gate!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Close the gate!
s08e05	The Bells	The massive crowd starts to panic, rushing towards to closed gate.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Open it!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 3: Open the gate!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Get back!
s08e05	The Bells	NORA points VICKY to sneak through the crowd towards another way into the Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: Look, try that one! Go! Go!
s08e05	The Bells	The crowd surges, crushing soldiers and citizens against the closed gate. The clamor rises and people become even more desperate. Far behind, the hooded JAIME sees that the gates are closed. He tries to jostle his way forward.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: The gates are locked now!
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Open!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Get back!
s08e05	The Bells	Trapped by the crowd and still far from the gate, JAIME rips off his hood. He waves his golden hand at the soldiers, hoping that they will recognize him.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Open the gate! Soldier! Soldier!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 4: Please open the gate!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Go back to your homes!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Stay back! It's closed!
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Soldier!
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME's cries are useless, lost in the din and chaos of the crowd.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Move away! Stop!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 5: Let us in!
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME gives up in frustration. He turns and fights through the crowd, moving away from this gate.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: We're not leaving!
s08e05	The Bells	The crowd screams and shouts, growing larger by the minute. JAIME slips into any alleyway and runs.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	The shouts of the citizens have reached CERSEI's ears. She looks down soberly.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION surveys the two armies.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE OUTER WALL
s08e05	The Bells	The Lannister soldiers scan the horizon.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: BLACKWATER BAY
s08e05	The Bells	EURON paces while his men look to the sky. Something in the sun catches his eye, and he shields his eyes as he looks directly at it. DROGON emerges from the blinding sun, diving through the sky towards the fleet. The Ironborn react to the attack.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER: Turn!
s08e05	The Bells	They bring the scorpion around and fire a bolt at DROGON. DAENERYS and DROGON evade the bolt and continue their steep dive.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON has lost the dragon in the sun once again. DROGON soars above the fleet. With a roar, he levels his trajectory and lets forth an eruption of fire, decimating the boat in front of EURON, flying past with unbelievable speed. DROGON destroys another ship before arcing away for a second sortie.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: Turn it around! Turn it around!
s08e05	The Bells	Angry at the soldier's incompetence, EURON rushes to position the scorpion himself.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: Get back! Back!
s08e05	The Bells	He is too late. DROGON destroys another handful of ships as he strafes the fleet.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: Fire!
s08e05	The Bells	The scorpion fires at the banking DROGON, but misses. DAENERYS and DROGON come directly towards EURON's ship. The dragon belches forth fiery destruction, shattering EURON's ship as he leaps overboard to avoid incineration.
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS and DROGON lay waste to the fleet and begin heading across the harbor towards the city itself, DROGON's tail skimming the water as they fly. Atop the walls, the soldiers aim their scorpions at the charging dragon.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: I can see her! Ready!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Move!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Fire!
s08e05	The Bells	They fire a bolt, but DROGON gracefully dodges, continuing to close the distance to the city wall at tremendous speed.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Reload!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 3: Reload!
s08e05	The Bells	The soldiers strain to ready the weapon for another strike.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Faster! Hurry!
s08e05	The Bells	The bolt locks in place. They start to aim the scorpion, but they are too late. DROGON engulfs them in a great burst of flame. The soldiers and the scorpion disintegrate in the powerful eruption.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Fire!
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON spews forth more destruction. Soldiers scream in agony. DAENERYS and DROGON swoop past as man and machine  incinerate.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	It is quiet. The two forces are still in their stand off. HARRY STRICKLAND is mounted before the Golden Company. GREY WORM, JON, and DAVOS lead the Stark/Targaryen forces. GREY WORM takes a step forward, reacting to something no one else has sensed. A horse whinnies and the wind picks up, carrying the sound of great wings flapping. Everyone turns their heads to try and locate the rising sound. STRICKLAND seems to hone in on the location, but he is too late. The gated wall behind the Golden Company explodes in an enormous fireball, destroying a huge section of the wall and consuming dozens of soldiers as the fire spews forth in a rage. STRICKLAND is knocked from his horse by the blast as the Golden Company scatters and his mount expires. DROGON flies over the destruction.
s08e05	The Bells	GREY WORM and the Unsullied charge, followed by the mounted Dothraki. Members of the Golden Company scream and writhe in agony as they burn. Stunned by the force of the blast, STRICKLAND pulls himself up on hands and knees. He sees the charging Dothraki army and panics. He finds his feet and begins flees towards the wall, limping and bloodied. The Dothraki ride past, as he looks nervously to either side. He falls, impaled by GREY WORM's spear. GREY WORM pauses to retrieve his spear from STRICKLAND's corpse with a grunt before resuming the charge with the rest of the Unsullied.
s08e05	The Bells	Screamingly wildly, the Dothroaki gallop through the broken wall into King's Landing. Continuing full speed, they rip through the Lannister soldiers just inside the walls, speeding through the street. The Lannister soldiers fall like dominoes, no match for the ferocity of their charge. Behind the Dothraki, the Stark forces reach the wall, roaring as they enter the city. One Stark soldier kneels by a severely burned member of the Golden Company who lies supine on the ground. The Stark soldier plunges his sword through the man's heart.
s08e05	The Bells	Above, DROGON flies along the wall and destroys another part of the battlement. The few Lannister soldiers who survived the Dothraki rise to meet the Stark men in battle, but they are no match. DROGON continues to destroy the unwieldy scorpions before they can even threaten the dragon. The Stark men continue to dispatch the Lannister soldiers, whose corpses begin speckle the streets. Scores of Lannister soldiers flee through an open yard, but DROGON catches up and destroys them with a mighty exhalation of fire. They die in a painful and brutal conflagration.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI listens to the sounds of destruction - the rumbling explosions and the screeching roar of the distant dragon. A vast section of the outer wall burns as DROGON and DAENERYS fly toward another part of the city. DROGON unleashes his fire breath once again.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE BREACHED WALL
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION walks through the battlefield, stunned by the carnage. In the distance, more Northern soldiers rush towards the battle.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: Go!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Run!
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON strafes another row of scorpions, demolishing the ramparts where they are mounted.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN passes the steadfast MOUNTAIN to approach CERSEI.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: Your Grace.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: All we need is one good shot.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: The scorpions have all been destroyed, Your Grace.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay. Euron killed one of her dragons. He can kill another.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning. The gates have been breached. The Golden Company-
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: Yes, Your Grace.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: The Red Keep has never fallen. It won't fall today.
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON roars. QYBURN exits.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	GREY WORM leads JON, DAVOS, and a force of Northern soldiers and Unsullied warriors through the charred and burning wasteland. Bodies are strewn everywhere. A Lannister soldier tries to set upon GREY WORM, but the Unsullied captain gores him clean through with his spear. Other Lannister soldiers make futile attacks that are quickly dispatched by JON and his men. Before them, the streets are empty and clear.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, A BIT LATER
s08e05	The Bells	JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM reach a crowd of Stark soldiers who are at a stand off with a perhaps one hundred Lannister soldiers.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: No, no, no!
s08e05	The Bells	JON: Move, move!
s08e05	The Bells	The Stark men part to let JON and his companions through . JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM stand in front of the Stark men facing the Lannister soldiers. The two sides take measure of one another, separated by the width of the street.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: FURTHER BACK IN KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION passes through a burning wall, making his way among piles of charred bodies. Ahead of him, some Unsullied warriors clear the streets. Beyond them is a bell tower and, further back, is the Red Keep. Smoke fills the air.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE ALLEYS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME runs through the streets and alleys, passing citizens who have yet to take shelter.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI continues to survey the battle.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	Citizens look up to see DROGON and DAENERYS diving towards them. DROGON roars and the panic ensues as people begin to run, desperate and terrified. Some protect their children while others knock down anyone in their way.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: Run. Run! Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON roars and glides over a street filled with fleeing innocents. He lands atop a parapet and roars at the city dwellers who are trapped before him.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF
s08e05	The Bells	JON and the leader of the Lannister battalion stare at one another.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON braces himself and lets out a mighty roar.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF
s08e05	The Bells	The leader of the Lannister soldiers hears the powerful roar. He seems to lose faith as he looks at the men around him. He drops in sword in surrender. The rest of the battalion follows suit, the message spreading through the troops behind him, back towards the Red Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 2: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: The bells!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Ring the bells!

s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Ring the bloody bells!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 3: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI stands at the window, listening to the cries of surrender from her citizens and soldiers.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Tell the queen to ring the bells.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 4: Ring the bells! Ring the bell!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE ALLEYS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME picks up a sword from a pile of weapons as he passes by. He dodges as citizens flee, heading in the opposite direction.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: This way.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME ducks into a dark open doorway.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION continues to look down the street at the bell tower and the Red Keep beyond.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER: Ring the bell!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: Ring the bell!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Ring them!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON snarls as DAENERYS sits and listens to the calls from people below.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 3: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 4: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 5: Help us!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI listens to the cries from below, stone-faced. THE MOUNTAIN continues to stand guard behind her.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 6: In the name of the-
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON roars in the distance.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 7: Queen! We're surrounded!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION waits for a reaction to the people's cries.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 2: Now! Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION looks up to where DROGON and DAENERYS are perched on the parapet. The dragon snarls and roars.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS does her best to control her rage as she waits.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: Hurry up!
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI considers her options.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS waits and listens. She is getting more anxious.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: TINSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI listens, frozen in disbelief or denial.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: Ring the bells!
s08e05	The Bells	The bell near the keep remains still.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION stares at the bell, pleading with his eyes. It sways and begins to ring.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF
s08e05	The Bells	JON hears the one bell ringing. It is joined by another, and another still. He looks up and sighs in relief.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI slowly closes her eyes in defeat. Her face remains expressionless.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION looks over as DROGON roars. The bells become a chorus across King's Landing. His eyes are fixed on DAENERYS and her dragon as he waits for her to react.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE PARAPET
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS sits atop DROGON, wide-eyed and fighting a frantic energy. She breathes deeply and her face twists with anger. She looks towards the Red Keep, built by her family and where the Targaryens had ruled for three hundred years. She thinks of all that she has suffered and endured and lost. Bells clamor as the Iron Fleet burns in far distance. She tries to choke back her rage, but she cannot. She spurs DROGON and the dragon takes to the sky.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION is distraught, staring in disbelief at DAENERYS's response to the bells.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: ABOVE KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	DAENERYS and DROGON fly directly towards the Red Keep. DROGON roars.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI watches as DROGON and DAENERYS fly towards her.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	As DROGON flies overhead, the citizens and Lannister soldiers panic and run. Behind some fleeing guards, DROGON unleashes his fire, decimating the surrounding buildings and consuming the soldiers.
s08e05	The Bells	Just beyond, innocents flee as quickly as they can. DROGON rises behind them, constantly spewing his deadly torrent of flame. Buildings collapse under the inferno, and citizens disappear as the raging fire consumes them.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION breathes shakily as he watches helplessly.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	The citizens flee, screaming and panting. DROGON's fire obliterates them.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF
s08e05	The Bells	JON watches DROGON from afar. The Lannister soldiers turn at the sounds of destruction. GREY WORM breathes deeply, cold vengeance in his eyes. At the back of the Lannister battalion, an eruption of DROGON's flame destroys a building and sends soldiers scattering. GREY WORM begins to lower his spear for attack. The leader of the Lannister soldiers spins quickly to face JON, knowing the terms of surrender have been breached. Before he can speak, GREY WORM changes his grip on his spear and hurls it through the man's chest. He falls, dead. JON's attention snaps to the ground in front of him. He hesitates. The Stark men act first, screaming a battle cry as they launch themselves at the Lannister soldiers. JON is frozen in indecision as his men begin to decimate the Lannister soldiers. Time slows down. Suddenly, JON comes to his senses. He grabs the man closest to him and pulls him back.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: No! Get back! Get back!
s08e05	The Bells	The Northerners pour around him and JON manages to stop a handful. GREY WORM turns his head toward JON, staring with a look of fierce disapproval.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: Stay! Stay!
s08e05	The Bells	JON's efforts are fruitless. GREY WORM stares coldly at him. Then a Lannister soldier attacks JON and he is forced into battle. GREY WORM turns to join the fray. JON defends and attacks. Further ahead, GREY WORM methodically dispatches guard after guard with precision and artistry. The Lannister soldiers are overwhelmed by the invading force. GREY WORM attacks with a brutality and rage, letting forth an uncharacteristic scream. His eyes are filled with hatred.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON and DAENERYS strafe another street, decimating Lannister soldiers and buildings alike. The guards scream as they die painful deaths. Some citizens huddle for safety while others try to flee the path of destruction.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI watches as DROGON scorches great swaths of King's Landing. Lines of fire scar the city and huge plumes of smoke rise beyond them.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	TYRION stands agog. Fleeing innocent citizens are incinerated.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER BATTLE
s08e05	The Bells	The Unsullied dispatch wounded Lannister soldiers as they advance through the streets. Nearby, citizens stampede and scream in panic. DAVOS tries to help direct them to safety.
s08e05	The Bells	DAVOS: Quickly. Quickly.
s08e05	The Bells	JON continues to try to stay his men from engaging in battle.
s08e05	The Bells	JON:  Stop!
s08e05	The Bells	Guards attack JON, forcing him back into the melee. The Stark men are starting to attack the fleeing citizens as well as Lannister soldiers. The frenzy of the battle takes over as the siege becomes a sacking of the city. The Unsullied attack expertly and without mercy.
s08e05	The Bells	A little girl hides behind a pillar as others run. A Stark soldier tackles a citizen, and his wife leaps out to stop him.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER: Get off me! Get off, bitch!
s08e05	The Bells	A Stark comrade pulls the woman off of the soldier and holds her back.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN: No, get off! Help! Help! No!
s08e05	The Bells	She screams and struggles until the soldier slits her throat. The little girl stands witness.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON lays waste to another street filled with innocents.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER BATTLE
s08e05	The Bells	JON shambles forward, helpless to stop the carnage. Some Lannister soldiers try to direct citizens out of harm's way.
s08e05	The Bells	LANNISTER SOLDIER: Go! Go!
s08e05	The Bells	JON's men continue to sack the city. He meet the attacks on him by reflex. He is overwhelmed by the wild carnage and is inability to stop it. He snaps to as one a Stark soldier drags a woman into an alley to rape her. The woman falls to the ground and tries to crawl away. The soldier continues his assault. Suddenly, JON grabs him from behind and pulls him off the woman, holding the soldier against the wall with his left hand and brandishing his sword. The soldier is surprised and confused. They exchange a look. The soldier looks at his intended victim and becomes defiant. JON runs him through, and the soldier collapses to the ground.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: (to the woman) Find somewhere to hide.
s08e05	The Bells	The woman flees. JON reels and catches his breath.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI watches as DROGON and DAENERYS strafe another section of King's Landing.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: My God!
s08e05	The Bells	The mighty dragon flies directly towards the keep. Below, the citizens run in panic. DROGON sets onto the castle itself, destroying a small tower.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE SHORE BENEATH THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME has reached the mouth of the cave that leads into the Red Keep. A dinghy sits on the shore, just as TYRION promised. He starts into the cave, but is stopped by a voice behind him.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: The Kingslayer.
s08e05	The Bells	An exhausted EURON wades onto the beach. The Iron Fleet burns in the distance beyond him. He spits out seawater.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: Listen. That's the sound of a city dying. It's over.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Well, maybe for you.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME starts to leave, but EURON draws his sword behind him.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: If you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: You're no king.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: Oh, but I am. And I fucked the queen. If I win, I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME swings his sword wildly at EURION, who evades back, stumbling against a boulder. JAIME brings down a powerful overhead swing that EURON dodges. Sword hits rock with a great clang.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	A piece of the ceiling falls, startling CERSEI. DROGON circles overhead. A great chunk of wall falls to the ground, crushing citizens below. DROGON and DAENERYS circle the keep, then bring their full force upon it. Spiraling about the Red Keep, DROGON slices through walls and towers with his devastating fire. The mighty castle starts to come undone and crash to the ground.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE SHORE BENEATH THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	The broken tower slides down the cliffside and into the water just beyond the beach. JAIME runs further into the cave while EURON pursues him. JAIME swings his sword, but EURON jumps back and counters with his own attack, slicing JAIME across the chest. JAIME staggers against the rock. Pivoting, JAIME knocks away EURON's sword with a blow, and they begin to grapple. EURON elbows JAIME in the face, wraps him up, and jerks him off balance. JAIME loses his sword. EURON throws JAIME into the rock, and staggers to catch his breath. JAIME tackles him, but EURON managed to get astride JAIME delivers repeated blows to his face. JAIME coils his legs and kicks EURON in the throat. EURON falls to the ground, gagging for air. JAIME tries to land a great punch, but EURON avoids him, and grapples JAIME onto the wet sand. EURON chokes JAIME while JAIME tries to push him away. JAIME lands a two-handed blow to EURON's arms, head butts EURON, and tosses him aside. JAIME chokes up blood as EURON crawls towards his sword. JAIME grabs EURON's foot, and pulls him back. EURON kicks JAIME dives, and grabs his sword as JAIME grapples him. EURON pulls himself around and plunges his sword into JAIME's side. JAIME reels with pain. EURON grunts and pants, then he pulls his sword free from JAIME's torso. They both fall back. JAIME scuttles on his back, away from EURON, then rolls onto his back, gasping.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	The entire city is aflame below CERSEI. Sounds of destruction fill the air. QYBURN enters.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI does not respond. A tear rolls down her face as her armor of denial comes down.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI weeps. She takes QYBURN's hand, and he leads her away. Below them, plumes of green wildfire explosions join the wholesale devastation of the capitol city. Dark and putrid smoke fills the sky.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE SHORE BENEATH THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	EURON pants in exhaustion. He is drenched in sweat and blood covers his mouth.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: You fought well for a cripple.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME wheezes, helpless. He looks down the beach. His sword is far from his grasp. He rolls onto his stomach and crawls towards it. EURON sees that there is still some fight in JAIME and he drop his head, sighing. JAIME reaches his sword, but EURON stands above him and plunges his sword into JAIME's side once again. Both grunt, then JAIME pushes EURON onto the ground, and rights himself. He gores EURON through the stomach. They both yell. JAIME pushes his sword in further, pinning EURON against sand and rock. He steps back. EURON grabs the blade with both hands. Both pant and scream. JAIME forces the sword in further. Hate joins the pain on EURON's face.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: Another king for you.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON grunts and JAIME pulls out his sword and stands over EURON. Blood pours from his stomach as EURON's head bows in relief. JAIME starts his way into the cave. EURON slides down the rock towards the sand. He twists his head to watch JAIME leave.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: But I got you!
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME walks into the mouth of the cave and into the lit passage beyond.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: I got you!
s08e05	The Bells	Panting, EURON smiles up to the sky.
s08e05	The Bells	EURON: I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE MAP COURTYARD OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON and DAENERYS swoop overhead as the rumbles of destruction echo. THE HOUND and ARYA enter the crumbing courtyard. They look up to the skies. DROGON roars. THE HOUND gives his head a little shake, knowing they have reached the point of no return.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Go home, girl. The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki.
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON roars in the distance.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Or maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: I'm going to kill her.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA tries to walk past THE HOUND, but he grabs her arm.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: You think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA jerks her arm free.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: It's all I care about. And look at me.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND grabs ARYA's shoulder to force her to face him.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Look at me! You wanna be like me?
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND cups his hand around the back of ARYA's head.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: You come with me, you die here.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND walks away. ARYA pauses, then turns.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: Sandor.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND turns back around.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: Thank you.
s08e05	The Bells	With a knowing look, THE HOUND exits the map courtyard and moves further into the keep. ARYA looks up as the walls continues to crumble around her.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI, QYBURN, THE MOUNTAIN, and the Queensguard descend the tower
s08e05	The Bells	staircase as DROGON roars overhead. A great section of the ceiling collapses behind them, revealing the ferocious glow of the fireball overhead. The tower shakes and the party falls to their knees. THE MOUNTAIN is felled by a chunk from the ceiling. Above them, the tower ceiling comes apart. THE MOUNTAIN shields CERSEI and PYCELLE with his body, taking great blows from the chunks that rain down. CERSEI cowers. DROGON  roars again and the entire ceiling gives way, burying some of the Queensguard.
s08e05	The Bells	When then destruction settles, THE MOUNTAIN stands erect. CERSEI and QYBURN are unharmed. There is nothing left of the tower behind them, only open sky filled with smoke. Debris falls continuously as the tower above them crumbles. THE HOUND enters below them. He nods at CERSEI.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Your Grace.
s08e05	The Bells	The four remaining Queensguard rush down to engage THE HOUND. He easily dispatches each of them in turn. He looks up to THE MOUNTAIN.
s08e05	The Bells	HOUND: Hello, big brother.
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN takes a step towards THE HOUND.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: Ser Gregor, stay by my side.
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN pauses and looks back at CERSEI with his gruesome red eyes. He takes another step.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: Ser Gregor, I command you.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN: Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.
s08e05	The Bells	QYBURN moves to intercept THE MOUNTAIN. The hulk effortlessly picks up QYBURN by the neck and tosses him down the steps. QYBURN's head smashes against the rubble-strewn stairs when he lands, cracking his skull and killing him instantaneously. THE MOUNTAIN takes a few more steps towards THE HOUND as CERSEI quivers behind him. DROGON roars. The Clegane brothers take measure of one another. CERSEI tentatively walks past THE MOUNTAIN and then slides past THE HOUND. She exits. More rubble falls as DROGON soars overhead, spewing fire.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND walks up the stairs towards THE MOUNTAIN, then draws his sword and starts his attack. THE MOUNTAIN fends off the blows with his armored arms, then grabs THE HOUND's blade. Enraged, THE HOUND rips his weapon free and attacks anew. THE MOUNTAIN parries with his arm. On his third blow, THE HOUND knocks off THE MOUNTAIN's helmet, revealing his brother's ghoulish face. The skin of THE MOUNTAIN'S revived corpse is fetid and rotting.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been.
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN draws his sword. He unleashed powerful swings that crush the railing and wall when THE HOUND dodges. Their swords clash with a powerful clang. THE MOUNTAIN roars.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE MAP COURTYARD OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	The castle continues to fall around her as CERSEI makes her way through the Red Keep. DROGON roars overhead. An exhausted JAIME enters the courtyard. CERSEI turns and sees JAIME propping himself up against a pillar. Her face brightens as she stares at him with disbelief. She sobs and he walks to her. They embrace and hold tight, panting. JAIME looks at her tears.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: You're hurt.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: It doesn't matter.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI pulls her hands away. They are covered in JAIME's blood. JAIME caresses her face.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: You're bleeding.
s08e05	The Bells	More of the Keep tumbles down. JAIME looks around for safe passage away from courtyard. They stagger together into the arcade.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND and THE MOUNTAIN battle ferociously. THE HOUND spins, traps THE MOUNTAIN's arms between his body and his left arm, then leverages THE  MOUNTAIN's sword away. He steps back and plunges his sword into THE MOUNTAIN's stomach, grunting with effort. He looks up with gritted teeth and forces the blade in further. THE MOUNTAIN stands impassive, one hand cupping the blade. THE HOUND cannot believe that THE MOUNTAIN still stands. He roars and pushes the blade harder. THE MOUNTAIN unleashes a mighty backhand that sends THE HOUND tumbling backward down the steps. THE HOUND struggles to look up. He watches THE MOUNTAIN pull the blade from hit gut, his armor falling away. THE MOUNTAIN descends towards THE HOUND, who sighs in exasperation.  The tower continues to collapse. THE HOUND chuckles at the impossibility of it all. THE MOUNTAIN grabs him by the collar, and flips him over, roughly.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA moves through the streets. Wounded denizens lean against the wall, screaming and wailing. Ash fills the air as debris falls and fires burn. ARYA switches directions and walks through the chaos. People yell and scream.
s08e05	The Bells	OWEN: Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?
s08e05	The Bells	OWEN grabs ARYA, frantic.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: Let go.
s08e05	The Bells	OWEN:  Have you seen my wife?
s08e05	The Bells	OWEN lets go and rushes off. ARYA continues. A child wails as others cry out in pain. ARYA ducks away from falling stone as people rush past her.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: Out of the way!
s08e05	The Bells	Flapping can be heard overhead. ARYA quickens her pace and collides with a man wearing a turban. DROGON roars. ARYA and the man push past one another. She heads down a darken staircase and emerges in a scene of carnage, the wounded huddled and hiding. Women wail, holding their mortally wounded loved ones. DROGON flaps his wings above them. ARYA flees. The man in front of her is felled by debris.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN: No!
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON roars and flies over them, his mouth spewing flames. ARYA jostles through the alley and into a flood of people running in panic. She gets pulled into the screaming mob. She looks behind her to scan the skies, but she loses her footing and falls under the rushing crowd.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND falls to the ground, grunting.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA tries to get up as people rush past.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Oh.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND tries to get up. THE MOUNTAIN grabs him by the collar
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	The crowd pushes ARYA down as they run over her.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN throws THE HOUND against the ruined wall. THE HOUND grunts and falls
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA continues to struggle against the crowd.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN throws THE HOUND once again.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA struggles and panics, caught under a stampede.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN holds THE HOUND against the wall by the throat. THE HOUND punches his brother in the jaw. THE MOUNTAIN responds with a more powerful blow to THE HOUND's jaw. THE HOUND collapses to the ground.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA continues to struggle and panic.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN unleashes on his brother. He picks up THE HOUND, who is barely conscious, by the shirt and hits him again.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA continues to struggle and panic, gasping for breath.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN pulls THE HOUND up by the shirt and brings him up to his knees. THE HOUND groans. THE MOUNTAIN lands a powerful downward punch to THE HOUND's face.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA covers her head for protection. She has given up on trying to stand. Suddenly, a helping hand appears.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: Take my hand. Take my hand! Get up. Get up.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA helps ARYA to her feet. VICKY is by her side. DROGON roars overhead.  Everyone ducks as DROGON flies past. The buildings around them start to collapse. People start to scatter. ARYA and NORA get torn from one another, swept up in the crowds.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: No. No.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: Wait! Wait! No!
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA looks back, searching for NORA, but it is futile. She starts to run with the crowd. Buildings along the street continue to collapse.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP
s08e05	The Bells	THE MOUNTAIN throws THE HOUND to the ground again. THE HOUND groans. THE MOUNTAIN picks his brother up by the neck and chokes him, slamming him against the wall. THE HOUND gurgles, exhausted and desperate for air. Gagging, THE HOUND tries to gain purchase on THE MOUNTAIN's hands. He shakes and writhes as THE MOUNTAIN pins him to the wall. THE HOUND frees his dagger from his belt and stabs THE MOUNTAIN just above the clavicle. THE MOUNTAIN does not react. THE HOUND stabs again with a grunt. Again, THE MOUNTAIN does not react. THE HOUND then stabs THE MOUNTAIN repeatedly in the torso.
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND: Fucking die!
s08e05	The Bells	THE HOUND stabs THE MOUNTAIN below the neck once more. THE HOUND laughs and chokes at the impossibility of THE MOUNTAIN's stamina. THE MOUNTAIN moves his thumbs atop the HOUND's eyes, presses his hands like a vice around THE HOUND's head, and raises his brother high in the air.  He presses his thumbs into THE HOUND's eye sockets. THE HOUND lets out short screams, his feet dangling helplessly. He blindly feels around THE MOUNTAIN's face before plunging his dagger deep into THE MOUNTAIN's left eye, the blade penetrating clean through to the other side. THE MOUNTAIN steps backward and THE HOUND collapses onto the floor. THE MOUNTAIN staggers backward, confused and blinded. THE HOUND coughs and sits upright. THE HOUND growls at his brother and pants. The MOUNTAIN regains his composure and slowly reaches for the hilt of the knife. The HOUND watches in disbelief. The MOUNTAIN starts to tug at the dagger. Screaming, THE HOUND launches himself at his brother. Just as THE MOUNTAIN frees the dagger from his face, THE HOUND tackles him. They crash through the compromised wall behind them. They fall amidst an avalanche of stone down to the raging fire far below and disappear into the conflagration.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER BATTLE
s08e05	The Bells	The Stark men yell at the Lannister soldiers while the citizens of King's Landing are caught in between. Behind JON, a building explodes from wildfire. The acrid green explosions speckle the burning city. DROGON flies in the distance. JON and DAVOS look at each other across the melee. They have both had enough. JON sheaths his sword.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: We need to fall back!  Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Fall back!
s08e05	The Bells	JON grabs a Stark soldier by the collar and forces him to join in the retreat. The Stark men begin to retreat. JON tries to command the civilians as well. One man is buried in a burning avalanche of debris.
s08e05	The Bells	JON: Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
s08e05	The Bells	The Stark men begin to run. DROGON flies overhead, strafing another street with flame.
s08e05	The Bells	SOLDIER 1: Fall back!
s08e05	The Bells	The soldiers and the civilians flee while DROGON soars overhead.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA lies unconscious on the ground, covered in a thin layer of ash. Blood from a head wound coats her cheek and has soaked into her tunic. She is awoken by an explosion nearby. She gasps and coughs. People shout in the distance. She pulls herself to her feet as people run past. She staggers and coughs, then stops to clear her lungs. Above her, the stone cracks in the high tower next to her, and begins its collapse. ARYA runs in terror as others around her scream and flee. Huge fragments fall around her, shaking the ground upon impact. ARYA is surrounded by dust.
s08e05	The Bells	The air clears and ARYA sits against a wall, panting. She calms herself and sees citizens who have also taken shelter there. She moves over to them and takes the hand of the cowering NORA.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN 2: We can't go out there.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: You have to.
s08e05	The Bells	WOMAN 2: Everyone out there is dead.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA pulls up NORA and VICKY.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: Follow me!
s08e05	The Bells	Others follow them out into the street. Other denizens rush past.
s08e05	The Bells	MAN 1: Come on, quickly. All of you.
s08e05	The Bells	Dothraki riders appear, and slaughter the men. ARYA leads NORA and VICKY down the street, running. The Dothraki ride past. ARYA is separated from NORA as they dive to opposite sides of the street to avoid a pair of galloping Dothraki.
s08e05	The Bells	A woman screams behind her. ARYA scampers back to NORA and VICKY.
s08e05	The Bells	VICKY: Mama! Mama! Mama!
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA gets to her feet and reaches the NORA and VICKY. NORA lies on the ground.
s08e05	The Bells	VICKY: No. Mama! Mama! Mama!
s08e05	The Bells	DROGON roars behind them. ARYA helps NORA to her feet. She is in great pain.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: Get up. Get up!
s08e05	The Bells	NORA yells in pain and ARYA grunts as they get her to her feet, her arm draped over ARYA's shoulder. They begin to limp down the street as others run and scatter. DROGON flies behind them.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA: We have to keep moving.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: Take her. Take her!
s08e05	The Bells	NORA falls to her knees. ARYA grabs VICKY and pulls her away from her NORA.
s08e05	The Bells	NORA: Take her.
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA:  Come on! Come on!
s08e05	The Bells	VICKY fights ARYA and wrestles free. She runs back to her NORA. DROGON floats towards them, and lets forth a burst of flame. ARYA dives into an alley as the NORA and VICKY are incinerated amongst the screams.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: RED KEEP CELLAR
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME and CERSEI enter the Red Keep cellar where the dragon skulls are stored. Sounds of destruction echo through the chamber.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: This way.
s08e05	The Bells	The tunnel JAIME intended to use has collapsed and is impassable. He looks for another way out, but the other tunnels are similarly blocked. CERSEI watches as he tries to climb the debris in front of one of the tunnel entrances. She appears shell-shocked.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME returns to her.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME embraces CERSEI. She weeps. Part of the cavern collapses.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: It's all right.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: Please don't let me die.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: It's all right.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: I don't want to die.
s08e05	The Bells	A large chunk of ceiling falls behind them.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Just look- Look at me. Look at me.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI: Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Look- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.
s08e05	The Bells	CERSEI looks at him. She fights back her tears.
s08e05	The Bells	JAIME: Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.
s08e05	The Bells	They caress one another. CERSEI focuses on JAIME. He nods in encouragement. They gather in a tight embrace. Behind them, the cavern begins its final collapse. The ceiling gives way in a wave of destruction that envelopes them, and they are gone.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	It is quiet. Smoke and huge flakes of ash waft though the air. ARYA sits quivering beside a blackened wall. She stands shakily and starts putting one foot in front of the other. She walks through the decimated streets. Fires burn everywhere. The street is littered with blackened bodies. ARYA sees the corpses of NORA and VICKY, embracing in death. She looks down the street, and sees a white horse, improbable as it is. She approaches slowly and gently takes its reins. She calms the horse.
s08e05	The Bells	CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e05	The Bells	ARYA rides the galloping horse down the length of the street, fires burning on each side.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: THE RUINS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION LANNISTER walks silently through the smoldering desolation of King's Landing as soldiers mill in the distance. Everything is covered in filthy soot and small fires continue to burn. His eyes looks skyward as his memories replay. Flakes of ash float in the air. He passes piles of brick and broken beams, and small fires that speckle the devastation. He passes the prone body of a blond girl, the first of many charred and incinerated corpses. He does not pause.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	A man comes towards TYRION, shambling in a state of shock.  His bare chest is streaked with soot, and his pants are in tatters.  TYRION looks back as he passes. The whole of the man's back is burned away severely. TYRION continues forward, with JON SNOW and SER DAVOS SEAWORTH trailing behind him. TYRION chokes down his rage as he walks. The bodies here have been reduced to skeletons, even those who were hiding indoors.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION, JON, and DAVOS pause at mangled body of a Lannister soldier.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I'll find you later.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I'm going alone.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION walks forward, alone. He turns a corner and pauses to take in the ruins of the Red Keep, then continues onward.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Unsullied soldiers stand at attention behind a line of kneeling Lannister prisoners. GREY WORM paces in front of them.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Grey Worm!
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON and DAVOS enter, along with their men. JON comes face-to-face with GREY WORM.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: It's over.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM:  These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM:  They are breathing.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: Look around you, friend. We won.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM:  I obey my queen's commands, not yours.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: And what are the queen's commands?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM:  "Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister." These are free men. They chose to fight for her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM draws his dagger, but JON grabs hold of his arm to stay him. As one, the Unsullied lower their spears and step into battle stance. The Stark soldiers respond by drawing their weapons to defend their King.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: Easy, men. Easy! Easy.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM and JON continue to stare each other down.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: Jon. We should speak with the queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The tension is broken and JON looks down. Accepting DAVOS's council, he releases GREY WORM's arm. They begin to walk away and the Unsullied return to attention. GREY WORM slits the throat of the first Lannister soldier. The man grunts softly as GREY WORM pushes him forward to die. JON and DAVOS exit.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: THE RED KEEP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION walks under the arcade leading to the map courtyard of the Red Keep. A great crack runs the length of the Westeros map, and piles of debris cover both sides of the broken floor. Ash flakes fall like snow. TYRION enters the chamber at the far side. He picks up a metal torch from the floor and continues further into the castle.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: THE RED KEEP CELLAR
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION moves by torchlight down a circular stairway leading below the Keep. He reaches the bottom and his eyes search the cavernous room.  Archways are filled with rubble, impassable. TYRION spies a crack of light in one archway. He places the torch on the ground.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: THE DRAGON SKULL CHAMBER
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION enters the cellar chamber containing the dragon skulls. He climbs a pile of rubble and comes upon JAIME LANNISTER's golden hand, half buried amongst the bricks. TYRION kneels, then bows as he touches the hand in grief. As he straightens, he takes away a single heavy brick and tosses it aside. He moves a second brick and then a third. JAIME's body starts to become visible. TRYION begins to weep, painfully. He fights back the tears, and begins to work again. After a few bricks, his sobs overtake him. Still mostly buried corpses, JAIME lays holding CERSEI LANNISTER. TYRION bawls, and smashes a brick repeatedly in frustration. He props himself up to look at his siblings. He sobs again.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA STARK walks through the streets, taking in the piles of debris and bodies. She is soot covered, her face bloody and filthy. Nearby, the Dothraki shout. She looks beyond the arches where the mounted Dothraki forces have amassed.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Amongst the Dothraki, JON strides forward. The Dothraki are still filled with battle lust, and their horses are antsy for action. After passing through the wild Dothraki, JON reaches the phalanx of disciplined Unsullied. He continues forward to a great staircase leading to a ruined structure. An expansive Targaryan flag hangs over the left side of the ruined facade.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: THE ADJACENT ARCADE
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Further back, ARYA also walks forward, staying under the arcade to the left of the riled Dothraki.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: THE RED KEEP STEPS
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON reaches the foot of the staircase, lined by Unsullied on each side. He ascends towards GREY WORM above. A dragon roars in the distance. JON takes a deep breath as he looks up at GREY WORM at the top of the stairs. DROGON roars again. As the dragon files over the Dothraki, they cheer wildly. DROGON glides over the ruined facade. JON renews his ascent.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON reaches the top of the stairs. DAENERYS TARGARYEN walks stoically from within the ruin of the building. DROGON roars and unfurls behind her. His wings appearing to expand from her soldiers, making her the image of a true dragon queen. DROGON then launches into the air. DAENERYS reaches the grand terrace, its staircase flanked by the disciplined Unsullied. She surveys the devastation of King's Landing, which continues to burn and smolder as far as the eye can see. JON walks to the wings as she takes her place in the center of the terrace, looking out over the ranks of the Unsullied, and the shouting Dothraki horde behind them. DAENERYS breathes deeply as she takes in her triumph, her destiny.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: THE COURTYARD
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The Unsullied stand at rigid attention.  The controlled stillness of the Unsullied provides stark contrast to the wild Dothraki ululations behind them.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The Dothraki, still mounted continue to celebrate in their visceral fashion. They waive their raises swords and cheer wildly. Their horses churn amongst themselves, feeding on the energy of their riders.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: THE TERRACE
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The Dothraki horde quiets and looks up to their khaleesi.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The Dothraki cheer.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DROGON lands on a ruined building to her left, and lets out a screeching roar. The Dothraki return the cheer, and resume their wild cries of celebration, waiving their weapons once again. From DAENERYS"s left, JON looks on with concern. DAENERYS surveys her forces with pride and satisfaction. She turns to speak to GREY WORM.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: Torgo Nudho.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM steps forward from her right.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The Unsullied thump their spears in a unison of slow triplets. GREY WORM steps back. From behind the terrace, TYRION approaches, his face a mask of malice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The Unsullied thump their spears.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The Unsullied thump their spears as DAENERYS continues her speech. JON and TYRION watch her, stone faced and roiling.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DROGON roars and the Unsullied thump in threes.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Will you break the wheel with me?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DROGON answers with a roar. The Unsullied answer by thumping their spears rhythmically. Behind them, ARYA looks on with disgust.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS savors the moment. The Unsullied thump. DROGON roars. The Dothraki go wild, horses rearing.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION takes a deep breath, passes JON, and approaches DAENERYS cautiously from behind. He stands to her right to take in the scene. DAENERYS looks at him, satisfied. DROGON roars. The celebrations continue, spears thumping in rhythm and Dothraki screaming amok.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: You freed your brother. You committed treason.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	They face one another. TYRION devastated and resigned, DAENERYS haughty. They lock eyes. TYRION removes his Queen's Hand brooch. He tosses it away in disgust. The brooch bounces half way down the steps, landing at the feet of an Unsullied warrior. The celebrations come to a quiet. DAENERYS and TYRION continue to take measure of one another. DAENERYS makes her decision.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: (In Valyrian) Take him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Two Unsullied step forward and flank TYRION. The dwarf accepts his fate, turns his back to the courtyard, and walks slowly away. The Unsullied pivot and walks beside him. TYRION gives JON a look that demands that JON come to his own reckoning of DAENERYS's slaughter of King's Landing. JON's sorrowful visage is weighed by the gravity of the situation. He watches GREY WORM lead TYRION away. JON turns back to look at DAENERYS. She is both transcendent and horrible. She sees JON's inner conflict, and chooses to let him think. She walks away from the courtyard, her Unsullied falling in line behind her. JON watches her go.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON steps into the courtyard behind the terrace and looks on as DAENERYS continues to walk on. He suddenly notices that ARYA has appeared silently at his side.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: What are you doing here?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Gathering himself, JON notices the cuts and wounds across ARYA's face. He takes hold of her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Hey, what happened?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: (sighs) She's everyone's queen now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	They watch DAENERYS walk away with her Unsullied.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: Try telling Sansa.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON starts to leave, but ARYA grabs his arm to halt him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: KING'S LANDING CELLAR
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON descends a staircase, followed by an Unsullied warrior. He looks at the two Unsullied guards at the foot of the staircase, then hands Longclaw back to his minder. He strides past the Unsullied.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	An Unsullied warrior opens the door for JON, who walks past him into a large, darkened storeroom strewn with cabinets, tables, pots, and crates.  The door shuts behind JON as he comes upon TYRION who sits on the floor, back against a small wooden pen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Did you bring any wine?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: No.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, "See, I told you." It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: (sighs)
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: So is there life after death?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Not that I've seen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: You didn't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION:  I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION:  Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION stands and approaches JON.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Cersei left her no choice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: And she burned down a city for it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Would you have done it?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: What?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: I don't know.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: (scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: What's it matter what I'd do?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: (sighs)
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON sits, overwhelmed, and inhales deeply. TYRION walks closer to him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION turns and walks towards one of the tables opposite JON.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: "Love is the death of duty."
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION stops and looks at JON, impressed.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: You just came up with that?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON sniffles and wipes his nose before answering.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON weighs TYRION's words, somber and distraught.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON exhales shakily. Then he stands, regaining his composure.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: That's her decision. She is the queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON pats TYRION's shoulder, and rests his hand there.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: I'm sorry it came to this.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON walks back to the door and knocks to call the guards.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION:  Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON:  She doesn't get to choose.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION:  No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Keys rattle outside the door and it swings open. The guard stands at attention. JON ponders, then leaves quickly. The Unsullied guard shuts the door.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: KING'S LANDING ARCADE
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON strides the length of an arcade that is lined by Unsullied soldiers.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: KING'S LANDING COURTYARD
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON walks in the snowy courtyard. The piles of rubble are covered by a layer of snow. More snow falls from the grey and blustery sky. He looks up at the Red Keep as he walks, approaching a passageway that leads to the Keep. As he approaches the passage, the large pile of snow before him cracks, then undulates and expands. It is DROGON, awakened from slumber. The blanket of snow that enveloped him falls away. The dragon growls and extends himself to smell JON, who stands motionless before the great beast. DROGON growls softly, and curls back around himself, accepting JON's presence. JON walks past him and into the dark passage.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: THE THRONE ROOM
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS walks out of the darkness into the half-demolished throne room. The Iron Throne sits untouched, surrounded by dust and snow. Open sky extends beyond it, where the wall of the Red Keep once stood. The wind blows and snow falls directly into the room. DAENERYS pauses, then walks to the Iron Throne, past the twisted and broken waste. She touches the hilt of one of the countless swords that have been forged into the throne. With a faint smile, DAENERYS takes in the enormity of the completion of her life's quest. She turns and looks back across the length of the hall.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON emerges from the same entryway that DAENERYS used. He walks towards her. She descends the steps to meet him, happy to share her victory with him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS takes on a defensive demeanor in response to JON's anger.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: It was necessary.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON:  Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: And Tyrion?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Forgive him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS:  I can't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS does not respond.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Please, Dany.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS comes closer, hopeful and bright.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS:  And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS:  Because I know what is good. And so do you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: I don't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS:  You do. You do. You've always known.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: They don't get to choose.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS embraces JON.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAENERYS: Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: You are my queen. Now, and always.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	They kiss, passionately. JON's right arm thrusts as they kiss. He grunts as his blade pierces DAENERYS through the heart. Their lips part. Panting, DAENERYS looks down at the blade in her torso, then up into JON's eyes. They both pant and gasp. DAENERYS falls back, JON holding her up with both arms. Her eyes glaze in pain and disbelief. She takes shallow, panting breaths as small rivulets of blood run from her mouth and nose. She dies. JON exhales sharply and begins to weep.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON cradles her dead body. In the distance, DROGON screeches. The dragon past, then circles back to the throne room. DROGON roars and growls as he scrambles slowly towards JON and DAENERYS. He sniffs, confused and curious. JON tenderly lays DAENERYS down onto the snow-covered floor and continues his half-embrace as he takes her in.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Behind him, DROGON pushes forward, growling. JON stands and faces the dragon. He steps carefully back to make room. DROGON nuzzles DAENERYS and coos. When she doesn't move, he nuzzles more firmly with his chin. Recognizing she is dead, DROGON gives a short, piercing whistle, then looks directly at JON. A rumbling growl builds as DROGON bares his teeth at JON. He rears back, screeching and whistling, then turns to the sky for a deafening roar. He spreads his wings, balancing on his haunches, roaring and roaring. He brings his forearms down, and looks directly down at JON. He roars and his throat glows as the fire builds in his belly. JON prepares for his immolation.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DROGON lets loose his inferno, extending his neck so that the flames surge past JON's head and burn the castle walls around the Iron Throne. DROGON stops, takes a deep breath, then blasts the Iron Throne with an unyielding conflagration. The mighty throne slowly gives way as DROGON spews fire and roars. The sword tips melt and bend. The throne becomes a glowing, amorphous slag under the relentless flames. It spills and melts away in a molten, flaming heap.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DROGON stops his assault. JON looks at the oozing, burning slag in amazement. Behind him, DROGON nuzzles DAENERYS again. Then the dragon grabs her gently in his hind claw. He takes to the sky, launching over the remains of the Iron Throne. He gives a final roar, and flies gently away.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION lies silently on the floor, eyes open, hands shackled. His beard and hair are longer than when he was last seen with JON. Footsteps approach and the door rattles open. GREY WORM enters, flanked by two Unsullied.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: AN ARCADE, DAY
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION walks with his hands chained. GREY WORM leads him to the Dragon Pit, with four unsullied marching behind them.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT; THE DRAGON PIT, DAY
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM and TYRION reach the entrance to the Dragon Pit. They pass the Unsullied footmen who stand at attention. The large awning tent stands in the center of the pit with many people seated underneath. GREY WORM and TYRION approach the central dais. Seated there in groups lining the sides of the tent are SAMWELL TARLY, a RIVERLANDS LORD, and EDMURE TULLY, then ARYA, BRAN STARK, and SANSA STARK, then SER BRIENNE OF TARTH, DAVOS, GENDRY BARATHEON, and a VALE LORD, then an IRONBORN LORD, YARA GREYJOY, and a DORNISH PRINCE and finally ROBIN ARRYN, MAESTER WOLKAN, and YOHN ROYCE. TYRION glowers at them, meets their eyes, and looks down in shame. GREY WORM stands with disciplined posture at his side.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: Where's Jon?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: He is our prisoner.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	YARA: Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: You swore to follow a tyrant.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	YARA: She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS stands.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM does not respond.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS sits.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: It's not for you to decide.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: (nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	MAESTER WOLKAN: We don't have a king or queen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION looks at GREY WORM, who shakes his head dismissively.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: Make your choice, then.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Those on the dais exchange glances. EDMURE seizes the moment. He stands and moves towards the center of the dais.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EDMURE: My lords and ladies.  I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: Uncle? Please sit.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EDMURE scoffs and looks around for support. He only finds muted laughter and averted gazes as he engages ROBIN, YOHN ROYCE, MAESTER WOLKAN and SAM. He turns to SANSA, whose eyes instruct him to take his seat. Humiliated, EDMURE turns and stumbles as his sword crashes into the post at his side. He sits, then sighs.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	MAESTER WOLKAN: Well, we have to choose someone.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM clears his throat to get everyone's attention.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: Why just us?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM stands.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Those gather ponder SAM's suggestion. YOHN ROYCE bursts out laughing, and others follow.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EDMURE: Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	YOHN ROYCE: I'll ask my horse.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM nods uncomfortably at their rejection, then sits.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EDMURE: (to TYRION) I suppose you want the crown.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Me? The Imp?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION shakes his head.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION glances up at GREY WORM, who returns it with a look of loathing of his own.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Can't think of a worse choice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS:  Who, then?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION looks at GREY WORM, who rebuffs him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION looks at GREY WORM again. This time, he holds the Imp's gaze.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION walks to BRAN.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The camera zooms in on BRAN, who pauses and blinks before responding.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: Why do you think I came all this way?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN gives an almost imperceptibly small knowing smile.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	There is a moment of heavy silence while the rest of the council considers. TYRION starts to glance around nervously, awaiting the first response.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM nods encouragingly at TYRION, who nods gratefully in return.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EDMURE: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	RIVERLANDS LORD: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EDMURE looks over at his nieces and nephew.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	YOHN ROYCE: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION turns to YOHN ROYCE, who nods in approval.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	MAESTER WOLKAN: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ROBIN: (nods) Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DORNISH PRINCE: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	YARA: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	IRONBORN LORD: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	VALE LORD: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GENDRY: (with a definitive nod) Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRIENNE: Aye.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA turns to BRAN.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN nods once, accepting SANSA's terms.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Everyone stands (except BRAN).
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ALL: All hail Bran the Broken!
s08e06	The Iron Throne	They sit. TYRION bows to BRAN and turns to leave.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: And I don't want to be king.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN:  I choose you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: You cannot.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: Yes, I can. I'm king.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM: (shakes his head) It is not enough.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION sighs and looks downwards.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION councils a very scruffy looking JON in his cell.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: There's still a Night's Watch?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: (sighs)
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Was it right? What I did?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: What we did.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: It doesn't feel right.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Ask me again in ten years.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION approaches JON and rests his hand on JON's shoulder. He starts to walk away.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: (nods)
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION exits.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: KING'S LANDING SEAWARD STAIRS, DAY
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON descends the stairs. The surf roars and seagulls call. Two men of the Night's Watch await him at the bottom of the stairs. They follow him as he continues towards the water. The bay is filled with ships.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING WHARFS
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON walks through the busy wharf. He looks up to see GREY WORM in the ship that he is passing. They take measure of one another, then JON looks down and continues on. An UNSULLIED CAPTAIN joins GREY WORM.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	UNSULLIED CAPTAIN: (in Valyrian) All the men have boarded.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	GREY WORM:  (in Valyrian) Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The UNSULLIED CAPTAIN nods and exits. The Unsullied prepare their ship for departure.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: KING'S LANDING SEA WALL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON walks along the sea wall. SANSA, ARYA, and BRAN are waiting for him.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON struggles to find any words.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: The North is free, thanks to you.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: But they lost their king.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA gives JON a tearful hug. He holds her close. JON then places his hand on ARYA's shoulder.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: I can't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: (chuckles) I'm not going back north.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA: Where are you going?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: What's west of Westeros?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: (chuckles) I don't know.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON and ARYA trade nods. ARYA's eyes fill with tears.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: You have your Needle?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA: Right here.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	A tear slips down ARYA's face. JON wipes it away before pulling her in for a tearful embrace. JON then kneels before BRAN.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: Your Grace.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON looks up at BRAN.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON: I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN gives JON a small smile. JON rises and sighs. He gives a last look at his three siblings and walks to the ship's boat filled with Night's Watchmen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: KING'S LANDING LIBRARY
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRIENNE sits in the library, paging through the Book of Brothers, which lists the history and deeds of all the knights in Westeros. She comes to the page for SER JAIME LANNISTER. It is only half written, and somewhat sloppily done. She fills his pages in careful script. She pauses to think about how to end the entry. Her final written line is "Died protecting his Queen." She closes the massive tome.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION enters first and looks at the chair inscribed for the hand. He sits down and sighs. He gets up quickly to straighten the other chairs at the table to make the room more presentable. The door opens, and he sits back down at the head of the table. SER BRONN OF THE BLACKWATER, DAVOS, and SAM, who is dressed in maester's garb, enter. BRONN and DAVOS noisily and uncouthly take their seats. TYRION quietly emits some futile protests.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: That's not- Uh-
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM places a large book in front of TYRION.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: What's this?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION starts to flip through the pages.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: Oh, I wouldn't say that.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM does not respond.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: He's not kind?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM:  He-
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: He what? What does he say about me?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION cannot believe it. BRONN smirks. TYRION pushes the book aside as the door opens. They stand as BRAN enters, his chair pushed by BRIENNE, now captain of the Kingsguard.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Your Grace.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: Your Grace.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: Your Grace.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: Your Grace.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRIENNE places BRAN at the other head of the table. TYRION sits, and the others follow his lead. They look to BRAN.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: And Drogon? Any word?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: He was last spotted flying east, toward-
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: The farther away, the better.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: As you wish, Your Grace.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRIENNE: Ser Podrick.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	PODRICK enters, also a Kingsguard. The small council stands.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: (clearing his throat) We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM:  Long may he reign.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS:  Long may he reign.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRIENNE: Long may he reign.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: Long may he reign.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	PODRICK wheels BRAN around.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: That will improve.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN: (smiling) I'm sure it will.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRAN and PODRICK exit. Everyone sits back down.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: In full, my lord Hand.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: Indeed we can.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	DAVOS: "Any more."
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: You Master of Grammar now too?
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: The strong live and the weak don't.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: Find the best builders and set them to the task.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SAM: Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRIENNE: I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	BRONN: I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	TYRION: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	EXT: CASTLE BLACK, DAY
s08e06	The Iron Throne	The wind whistles on a grey day at the wall. A horn sounds as JON and two Night's Watchmen arrive on horseback. The doors are opened for them. Jon breathes deeply, gathering his emotional strength. In the courtyard, TORMUND stands, resting. JON spurs his mount forward. The gate closes behind him. There is a slow fade to black
s08e06	The Iron Throne	INT: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON picks up Longclaw from the table.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: ARYA'S SHIP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA sheaths Needle.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: WINTERFELL

s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON sheaths Longclaw at his hip.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Handmaidens continue to dress SANSA. Her sleeves feature Stark direwolf scale-like fur design on the outside and embroidered autumn leaves on the inner lining.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON rolls a pack of tools.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: ARYA'S SHIP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA unrolls a map on a table. She collapses a spy glass, places it in her pocket, and exits her quarters.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON walks along a covered snow walkway.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA walks along a torchlit hallway.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: ARYA'S SHIP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA walks through a ship's darkened passageway, then up the steps that lead to the deck.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON walks slowly down stairs to a landing to look out over the crowd of Night's Watchmen and Free Folk that have gathered in the snowy courtyard. He turns back without speaking.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	SANSA enters the crowded Great Hall. As she walks past, everyone kneels before her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: ARYA'S SHIP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA walks through along the ship's deck as the crew works.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON walks through the crowd of Free Folk and Night's Watchmen.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Seen from above, SANSA progresses though the hall and her people kneel.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: ARYA'S SHIP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Seen from above, ARYA walks as the crew works efficiently. The ship sails at a steady clip.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	Seen from above, JON makes his way through the ragtag crowd of Wildlings. They part to make way for him. GHOST whines, and JON smiles. The direwolf is missing an ear and has other cuts and abrasions. JON walks over and kneels down to pet him. GHOST licks him in return and JON grins.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: ARYA'S SHIP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA stands just behind the direwolf figurehead of her ship. She looks out at the unknown seas ahead and smiles.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON and TORMUND are mounted behind the gate that leads from Castle Black to the tunnel through the Wall. The gate rises before them.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: WINTERFELL
s08e06	The Iron Throne	A braided crown featuring the Stark direwolf at the crest is placed onto SANSA's head. She surveys her subjects and takes a seat on her throne, also adorned with Stark direwolf carvings. Her soldiers draw their swords and salute her.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	MAN: The Queen in the North!
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ALL: The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North!
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: ARYA'S SHIP
s08e06	The Iron Throne	ARYA stands at the prow and the ship sails to the west. Her sails display the Stark direwolf.
s08e06	The Iron Throne	CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
s08e06	The Iron Throne	JON rides through the tunnel with TORMUND behind him. GHOST reaches the other side of the Wall first. The Free Folk follow behind them. They move out into the snowy landscape, and the Free Folk chatter happily as they walk. JON stops and looks back as the external gate closes. He glances around at the Free Folk around him and begins moving again. They reach the first expanse of woods, and continue northward.
