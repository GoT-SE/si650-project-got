One lot steals a goat from another lot, before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces. I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life. How close did you get? - Close as any man would. - We should head back to the Wall. Do the dead frighten you? Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more. You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse. Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children. It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter. If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again. Your dead men seem to have moved camp. They were here. See where they went. What is it? It's Go on, Father's watching. And your mother. Fine work, as always. Well done. Thank you. I love the detail that you've managed to get in these corners. Quite beautiful. The stitching Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very - It's beautiful. - Thank you. And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on. Don't think too much, Bran. Relax your bow arm. - Quick, Bran! - Faster. Lord Stark! My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch. Get the lads to saddle their horses. Do you have to? He swore an oath, Cat. Law is law, my lady. Tell Bran he's coming too. Ned. Ten is too young to see such things. He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming. Good lad, go run back and get the rest. White walkers. I saw the white walkers. White walkers. The white walkers, I saw them. I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them, but I saw what I saw. I saw the white walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry. Forgive me, Lord. In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, - the first of his name - Don't look away. King of the Andals and the First Men - Father will know if you do. Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die. You did well. You understand why I did it? Jon said he was a deserter. But do you understand why I had to kill him? \"Our way is the old way\"? The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. Is it true he saw the white walkers? The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years. So he was lying? A madman sees what he sees. What is it? Mountain lion? There are no mountain lions in these woods. It's a freak. It's a direwolf. Tough old beast. There are no direwolves south of the Wall. Now there are five. You want to hold it? Where will they go? Their mother's dead. They don't belong down here. Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother. - Right. Give it here. - No! Put away your blade. - I take orders from your father, not you. - Please, Father! I'm sorry, Bran. Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your house. They were meant to have them. You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves. What about you? I'm not a Stark. Get on. What is it? The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow. As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you you worry too much. - It's starting to show. - And you never worry about anything. When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock, you were never afraid. There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father. \"We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.\" - What if Jon Arryn told someone? - But who would he tell? My husband. If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on. You should be the Hand of the King. That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short. All these years, and I still feel like an outsider when I come here. You have five northern children. You're not an outsider. I wonder if the old gods agree. It's your gods with all the rules. I am so sorry, my love. - Tell me. - There was a raven from King's Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you. - Your sister, the boy? - They both have their health, gods be good. The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell with the queen and all the rest of them. If he's coming this far north there's only one thing he's after. You can always say no, Ned. We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. - I'm told he reads all night. - I'm told he drinks all night. How much could he possibly drink? A man of his stature? We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out. In any case, candles. Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king? It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's a sleek bit of mink. I hear the prince is a right royal prick. Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick. Go on, Tommy, shear him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair. Gods, but they grow fast. Brandon! I saw the king. He's got hundreds of people. How many times have I told you? No climbing. But he's coming right now, down our road. I want you to promise me, no more climbing. I promise. - Do you know what? - What? You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close. Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Oh. What are you doing with that on? Go on. Move! Your Grace. You've got fat. - Cat! - Your Grace. Nine years Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been? Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours. - Where's the Imp? - Will you shut up? Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is? Arya. Oh, show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier. That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother. Would you please shut up? My queen. Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects. We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait. Ned. Where's the Imp? Where is our brother? Go and find the little beast. Tell me about Jon Arryn. One minute he was fine and then burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man. We both did. He never had to teach you much, but me? You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. - He showed me what was what. - Aye. Don't look at me like that. It's not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned, down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark I would name you the Hand of the King. I'm not worthy of the honor. I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our houses. It is true what they say about the northern girls. Did you hear the king's in Winterfell? I did hear something about that. And the queen and her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms. And the other brother? - The queen has two brothers? - There's the pretty one and there's the clever one. Mmm I hear they call him the Imp. I hear he hates that nickname. Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher, prone to all manner of perversions. Clever girl. We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion. Have you? - Already? - Oh! The gods gave me one blessing. - Don't get up. - My lord. Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother? You have much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention. She has odd cravings, our sister. A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. - Don't leave me alone with these people. - I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses. I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time Come on, girls. See you at sundown. Close the door! Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her. She was my sister. This is where she belongs. She belonged with me. In my dreams, I kill him every night. It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone. Not all of them. Daenerys! Daenerys. There's our bride-to-be. Look, a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Go on, feel the fabric. Mmm. Isn't he a gracious host? We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything. Illyrio's no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let them see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you? No. When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today. It's too hot, my lady. Where is he? The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality. May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, and his sister, Daenerys of House Targaryen. Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen. Come forward, my dear. Where is he going? - The ceremony is over. - But he But he didn't say anything. Did he like her? Trust me, Your Grace, if he didn't like her, we'd know. It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king. When will they be married? Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long. Is it true they lie with their horses? I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo. Do you take me for a fool? I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense. I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army. I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home. So do I. I want us both to go home, but they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home? I don't know. We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took. Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly? Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived. He's so handsome. When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait? Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes. Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms. He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you. You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make Father say yes! - Sansa - Please, please! It's the only thing I ever wanted. Fill that up! Boys, Rodrik, come on. Come on! Come here, you little beauty! Is he dead yet? Uncle Benjen. You got bigger. Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast? Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst. Well, you're always welcome on the Wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there. So take me with you when you go back. - Jon - Father will let me if you ask him. I know he will. The Wall isn't going anywhere. I'm ready to swear your oath. You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. - None of us will ever father sons. - I don't care about that. You might, if you knew what it meant. I'd better get inside, rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later. Your uncle's in the Night's Watch. What are you doing back there? Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall. You're Tyrion Lannister, the queen's brother? My greatest accomplishment. And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you? Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though. Lord Eddard Stark is my father. And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you the bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you. What the hell do you know about being a bastard? All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes. You at a feast it's like a bear in a trap. The boy I beheaded - did you know him? - Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned, a true ranger. He was talking madness. Said the walkers slaughtered his friends. The two he was with are still missing. Hmph. A wildling ambush. Maybe. Direwolves south of the Wall, talk of the walkers, and my brother might be the next Hand of the King. Winter is coming. - Uncle Benjen. - Robb boy. - How are you? - I'm good. Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace? Yes. Lovely country. I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time. Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. - How old are you? - Thirteen, Your Grace. You're tall. Still growing? I think so, Your Grace. And have you bled yet? No, Your Grace. Your dress, did you make it? Such talent. You must make something for me. I hear we might share a grandchild someday. I hear the same. Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever. - Your pardon. - I hear we might be neighbors soon. - I hope it's true. - Yes, the king has honored me with his offer. I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept.", "summary": null, "review": null}, "1": {"id": "s01e02", "name": "The Kingsroad", "script": "You need to drink, child. And eat. lsn't there anything else? The Dothraki have two things in abundance - grass and horses. People can't live on grass. ln the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. lt murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything - that's the way the world will end. lt'll get easier. Khaleesi! Your hands. We're still not far from Pentos, Your Grace. Master lllyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there. l have no interest in hospitality or comfort. l'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and l have my crown. As you wish, Your Grace. Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, l suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver? Selling to one. Some poachers l caught on my land. Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that. Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today. Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies. What good will my sympathies do them? None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted. The boy means nothing to me. And l can't stand the wailing of women. One word and l'll hit you again. l'm telling Mother! Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand? You can't Do you understand? The Prince will remember that, little lord. l hope so. lf he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Ah. Time for breakfast. Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black. Hyah. - Little brother. - Beloved siblings. ls Bran going to die? Apparently not. - What do you mean? - The maester says the boy may live. lt's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain. Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the North seem entirely lost on you. l still can't believe you're going. lt's ridiculous, even for you. Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the white walkers. Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black. And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. No, l just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world. The children don't need to hear your filth. Come. Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good, clean death any day. Speaking for the grotesques, l'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life ah, life is full of possibilities. l hope the boy does wake. l'd be very interested to hear what he has to say. My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on. My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much l love my family. Please. Oh, l would have dressed, Your Grace. This is your home. l'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? l lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too - tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. lt's the last thing you need to hear right now. l never knew. lt was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care. The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing. A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. l screamed and l battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and l never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. l pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you. l am grateful. Perhaps this time she'll listen. A sword for the Wall? - l already have one. - Good man. - Have you swung it yet? - Of course l have. At someone, l mean. lt's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood, and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall - wildlings and white walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us. We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8,000 years. ls it \"we\" already? Have you taken your vows, then? Soon enough. Give my regards to the Night's Watch. l'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not it's only for life. Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says l have to do it again. My things weren't properly folded, she says. Who cares how they're folded? They're going to get all messed up anyway. lt's good you've got help. Watch. Nymeria, gloves. - lmpressive. - Shut up. Nymeria, gloves! l have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully. A present? Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself. - lt's so skinny. - So are you. l had the blacksmith make it for you special. lt won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough. - l can be quick. - You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance? l think so. First lesson - stick them with the pointy end. l know which end to use. l'm going to miss you. Careful. All the best swords have names, you know. Sansa can keep her sewing needles. l've got a needle of my own. l came to say goodbye to Bran. You've said it. l wish l could be here when you wake up. l'm going north with Uncle Benjen. l'm taking the black. l know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. l'll know my way around by then. l'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid. l want you to leave. you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again. l have no choice. That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. Cat l can't do it, Ned. l really can't. You can. You must. You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. l know it. You Starks are hard to kill. My mother? - She was very kind. - Good. Next time l see you, you'll be all in black. lt was always my color. Farewell, Snow. And you, Stark. There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood. ls my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where l am, where l'm going? Does she care? The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. Hmm? l promise. Gods, this is country! l've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going. l've half a mind to go with you. What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight. You should have asked me 20 years ago. There were wars to fight, women to marry - we never had the chance to be young. l recall a few chances. There was that one Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca. With the great big tits you could bury your face in. Bessie. She was one of yours. Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie. And her tits. Yours was, er Aleena? No. You told me once. Er Meryl? Your bastard's mother? - Wylla. - That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like. Nor will l. We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. l swear if l weren't your king, you'd have hit me already. The worst thing about your coronation - l'll never get to hit you again. Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night. Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Do we send her a wedding gift? A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one, and a bold man to wield it. She's little more than a child. Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding. - Tell me we're not speaking of this. - Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family - that was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister - the woman l loved. l'll kill every Targaryen l get my hands on. But you can't get your hands on this one, can you? This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde. Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert. There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper. lf the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, - the scum will join him. - He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea. There's a war coming, Ned. l don't know when, l don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming. Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them. Ah, rapers. They were given a choice, no doubt - castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch - you discard your old family and get a whole new one. Why do you read so much? Look at me and tell me what you see. ls this a trick? What you see is a dwarf. lf l'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, l was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years. Until your brother killed that king. Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king, and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. l must do my part for the honor of my house. Wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and l have my mind, and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why l read so much, Jon Snow. And you? What's your story, bastard? Ask me nicely and maybe l'll tell you, dwarf. A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms. The Night's Watch protects the realm from Ah, yes, yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense. Everything's better with some wine in the belly. lt's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us. Talk to Poole about it. Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require - our immediate attention. - l don't care about appointments! l'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning. Very good, my lord. My lady. When was the last time you left this room? l have to take care of him. He's not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed. What if he's wrong? - Bran needs me. - Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, - clutching my leg, crying - Close the windows! l can't stand it! Please make them stop! Fire. You stay here. l'll come back. You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. lt's a mercy. He's dead already. No! - Have you ever seen a dragon? - Dragon gone, Khaleesi. Everywhere? Even in the East? No dragon. Brave men kill them. - lt is known. - lt is known. A trader from Qarth told me that dragons come from the moon. The moon? He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat, and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire. Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess - wife of sun. - lt is known. - lt is known. Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Qarth tell you these stories? Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was myjob to make men happy. How old were you? l was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house. Nine?! l did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn. Can you teach me how to make the khal happy? Yes. Will it take three years? No. Welcome. What l am about to tell you must remain between us. l don't think Bran fell from that tower. l think he was thrown. The boy was always surefooted before. Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see. - Saw what, my lady? - l don't know. But l would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the Crown. Did you notice the dagger the killer used? lt's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him. They come into our home and try to murder my brother? lf it's war they want lf it comes to that, you know l'll stand behind you. What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Hmm? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this. l don't trust a raven to carry these words. - l'll ride to King's Landing. - No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. - l will go myself. - Mother, you can't. l must. l'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you. Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. l don't want the Lannisters to know l'm coming. Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone. What about Bran? l have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now. No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. lt is said that lrogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes. Finish a man? Oh. Kings traveled across the world for a night with lrogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all. Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. l l don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top. You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you. l l don't think that this is the Dothraki way. lf he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you? No. No! Tonight l would look upon your face! Pardon me, ser. Do l frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face. l'm sorry if l offended you, ser. Why won't he speak to me? He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the Mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers. He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser llyn Payne, the King's Justice. The Royal Executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. l don't like to see you upset. The sun's finally shining. Come walk with me. Stay, Lady. l probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts. My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry. You're safe with me. l'll get you! Arya! Ow! What are you doing here? - Go away. - Your sister? - And who are you, boy? - Mycah, my lord. - He's the butcher's boy. - He's my friend. A butcher's boy who wants to be a knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are. She asked me to, my lord. She asked me to. l'm your prince, not your lord, and l said pick up your sword. lt's not a sword, my prince. lt's only a stick. And you're not a knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting. Do you know that? - Stop it! - Arya, stay out of this. l won't hurt him much. Arya! Filthy little bitch! No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you! You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything! l'll gut you, you little cunt! - Arya! - Nymeria! Arya! Nymeria! No. No. Please don't. Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here. l'll go back to the inn and bring help. Then go! Don't touch me. The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream. You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on. Run. Go! Leave now! - lt's a direwolf. - l'll check down here. l think l heard a noise. Go! Arya! Arya! Arya! Arya! Arya! Arya! My lord! My Lord! They've found her. - She's unharmed. - Arya! - Where is she? - She's been taken directly before the king. - Who took her? - The Lannisters found her. - Arya! - Right, get back. The queen ordered them to bring her straight to him. Back! Back to the inn! All back! l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry. - Are you hurt? - No. Oh, it's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once? How dare you speak to your king in that manner? Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. l never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly. Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off. That's not true! She just bit him a little. - He was hurting Mycah. - Joff told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him. That's not what happened! Yes, it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river. - Liar! - Shut up! Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am l to make of this? - Where's your other daughter, Ned? - ln bed, asleep. She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.", "summary": ["Plot Bran's fate remains in doubt. Having agreed to become the King's Hand, Ned leaves the North with daughters Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn stays behind to tend to Bran. Jon Snow heads north to join the brotherhood of the Night's Watch. Tyrion decides to forgo the trip south with his family, instead joining Jon in the entourage heading to the Wall. Viserys bides his time in hopes of winning back the throne, while Dany focuses her attention on learning how to please her new husband, Drogo.  Summary In the Dothraki Sea The Dothraki khalasar led by Khal Drogo have departed Pentos and are heading east. They travel away from the Free Cities and into the Dothraki sea, the long-grassed plains that the Dothraki call home. Viserys Targaryen accompanies the khalasar, meaning to stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and provides him with an army with which to invade Westeros, despite Ser Jorah Mormont's suggestion. He tells Viserys that he offended his liege lord, Eddard Stark, by selling poachers into slavery. When he received word that Eddard meant to execute him for the crime (slavery has been illegal in Westeros for centuries), he fled to Essos. Viserys laughs at the notion, saying such trivialities would not be punished under his reign. Daenerys is finding adapting to her new role as khaleesi to be a huge challenge. Only Mormont offers her some solace, telling her it will become easier. Daenerys is however fearful of her new husband and it is revealed that their first sexual encounter has left her slightly injured.  Fascinated with her gift from Illyrio, Dany asks her handmaidens if they have ever heard of dragons surviving in the east. They reply no, but Doreah, a former pleasure-girl from Lys, tells her an old story about how there used to be two moons in the sky. One wandered too close to the sun and cracked like an egg, spilling out thousands of dragons into the world. Dany's Dothraki handmaidens Irri and Jhiqui dismiss the story, saying that the moon is a goddess, wife to the sun.  Daenerys seeks the advice of her handmaid Doreah. Doreah instructs Daenerys on how to please Drogo in bed but also how to use her skills to gain respect from him. Doreah tells Daenerys, \"You are no slave,\" and that Daenerys should not have sex like one. Daenerys nervously puts these plans into action and is surprised to find Drogo responsive, particularly once she starts using her body in combination with the Dothraki language to speak to him.  In the North Robb 1x02 Robb Stark says farewell to Jon.  In Winterfell, Bran Stark lies unconscious and badly wounded, his mother by his side. Tyrion Lannister insists to his nephew Joffrey that Joffrey pay his respects to Lord and Lady Stark, since his absence has been noted. When Joffrey refuses, saying the boy means nothing to him, Tyrion slaps Joffrey three times until he accepts his uncle's suggestion. Tyrion then breakfasts with his other family members, informing them of his decision to journey north to see the Wall before returning to King's Landing. He also tells them that Bran is expected to live and notes Cersei and Jaime's guarded reactions.  Cersei visits Catelyn Stark, who is sitting by her son's side, and tells her that her first child, a beautiful, black-haired boy, died of a fever. She and Robert were grief-stricken and her prayers and tears were for naught. She offers to pray for Bran's survival, hoping that this time the gods will listen.  Jon Snow has Winterfell's blacksmith, Mikken, forge a light sword for his sister, Arya. Arya is excited by the gift and names it Needle. Jon also gives her advice on how to best use the weapon: \"Stick them with the pointy end.\" Jon urges Arya to practice every chance she gets and they hug. Jon then visits his still-comatose Bran to say his farewells and kisses his forehead, before departing at his stepmother's cold request. Eddard then says his goodbyes to his son and to a grieved Catelyn, who is angered at his departure while Bran remains ill. Outside, Robb and Jon hug each other before they depart, hoping to see each other soon.  Distant Winterfell The two parties depart Winterfell.  The parties depart Winterfell: Jon, Tyrion and Benjen Stark to the Wall; and Eddard, Arya, Sansa and the royal party south to King's Landing. At their parting, Eddard tells Jon, \"You are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.\" Ned also promises Jon to tell him about his mother the next time they see one another.Eddard and Jon Eddard Stark says goodbye to his bastard son.  Days later, on the Kingsroad south to the capital, King Robert Baratheon calls a halt to discuss with Eddard some dire news that has just arrived. Robert's spies have learned of Daenerys Targaryen's marriage to Khal Drogo, whose khalasar is reported to number over one hundred thousand warriors. Eddard points out that the Dothraki cannot cross the Narrow Sea, as they have no ships, but Robert is concerned that the Seven Kingdoms will soon face another war. A curious Robert asks Eddard about Wylla, the mother of his bastard son, but Eddard refuses to enlighten him. Robert reminds him that at that time, they were in the middle of a war and no one knew if they would ever return to their families.  In Winterfell, Catelyn's refusal to leave Bran's side is starting to cause problems for the smooth running of the castle. Robb offers to work with Maester Luwin to put the castle to rights. There is then a fire in part of the castle, but this proves to be a distraction to allow an assassin to attempt to finish off Bran. Catelyn holds the assassin off long enough for Bran's direwolf to enter the chamber and tear out the assassin's throat.  Kingsroad1 Jon and Tyrion discussing matters.  Traveling north, Jon and Tyrion talk, and Tyrion reveals that he reads books to sharpen his mind, his greatest asset and weapon. As it travels north, the party is joined by several, new recruits \u2014 rapists who chose to \"take the black,\" rather than face the knife. Tyrion tells Jon that the Night's Watch is not the noble institution it was once was, idealized with glorious knights defending the realm against the horrors lurking beyond the Wall, and says Jon is smarter than to believe the stories his wet-nurse told him about \"grumpkins and snarks and other monsters\".  In Winterfell, Catelyn goes to the tower from where Bran fell and finds a strand of blonde hair on the floor. She summons Robb, Theon, Luwin and the castle master at arms, Ser Rodrik Cassel and tells them that she suspects that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran because he might have seen something in the tower. Robb and Theon are all for making war, but Luwin schools them to caution. Catelyn decides that Ned must know the truth and resolves to travel south to King's Landing and meet him there. Ser Rodrik will escort Catelyn while Robb will remain in Winterfell to take charge of the castle in Catelyn's absence.  At the Wall The Wall from the south The Wall, as seen by Jon's party.  Jon's party crests a rise and sees the Wall before them. Benjen welcomes them, and Tyrion seems impressed by the Wall's sheer size.  At the Inn at the Crossroads On the Kingsroad, the royal party reaches the Crossroads Inn, a noted waystop on the way south to the capital. Prince Joffrey's bodyguard, Sandor Clegane, also known as \"the Hound,\" a man with half his face burned in a mysterious accident, introduces Sansa to Ser Ilyn Payne, the king's headsman, a frightening-looking man who had his tongue torn out on the orders of the Mad King many years ago. Joffrey saves Sansa from this unpleasantness and takes her for a walk along the riverbank. They find Arya practicing her sword work with Mycah, the son of the party's butcher. Joffrey pretends to take offense at Mycah using a sword on the sister of his betrothed and starts to gleefully cut Mycah's face with his sword, but an outraged Arya hits him on the head with a stick. Joffrey quickly becomes violent and threatens Arya at sword point, but before he can hurt her, Arya's direwolf, Nymeria, attacks Joffrey, biting at his arm. Mycah runs off, and Arya throws Joffrey's sword in the river before running off herself. Sansa tries to help Joffrey, but he spitefully tells her to leave him alone and go for help.  Arya, knowing that Nymeria will be punished for injuring the prince, forces the direwolf to flee by throwing a rock at her. She is then taken before the King, who is angered that a minor fracas has become a major incident, with his wife and new Hand blaming one another's children. Joffrey offers a false account of the incident, and asks Sansa to confirm it. Put in an impossible position, Sansa refuses to contradict him, enraging Arya. The King decides to let Ned discipline Arya while he will do the same to Joffrey, but Cersei demands that the direwolf be executed. When Nymeria cannot be found, Cersei spitefully requests that Sansa's direwolf Lady be killed instead, and Robert acquiesces, upsetting Sansa and further angering Arya.  Furious, Eddard attends to the matter himself, passing the Hound arriving with Mycah's bloodied corpse. Eddard is shocked and disgusted, and when he asks if the Hound ran Mycah down, the Hound responds \"He ran, but not very fast.\" Eddard kills Lady with a dagger, and hundreds of miles away, Bran awakens."], "review": null}, "2": {"id": "s01e03", "name": "Lord Snow", "script": "Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested. Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. - And, Jory, you go with them. - Yes, my lord. If you'd like to change into something more appropriate Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership. Glad to see you're protecting the throne. Sturdy old thing. How many kings' arses have polished it, I wonder? Um, what's the line? The king shits and the Hand wipes. Very handsome armor. - Not a scratch on it. - I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss. You've chosen your opponents wisely then. I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you, coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father, too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that. But you just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later when I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned It felt like justice. Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back? Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more? You served him well when serving was safe. Lord Stark. Lord Varys. I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery. A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well. And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but But we have a kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. - No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me. - She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well. All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone. Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with. It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree. I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark. Grand Maester. How many years has it been? - You were a young man. - And you served another king. Oh, how forgetful of me. This belongs to you now. Should we begin? - Without the king? - Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother. His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load. We are the lords of small matters here. My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King. - Mm, how much? - 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, Can the treasury bear such expense? I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold. What's another 80,000? Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt? - I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt. - How could you let this happen? The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it. I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm. Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen. \"Counting coppers,\" he calls it. I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford. As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans. There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my lords. I'm - I had a long ride. - You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark. We serve at your pleasure. - Ow! - Please, it's nearly healed. - It's ugly. - A king should have scars. You fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father. I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them. That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. I didn't, I When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it. Do I have to marry her? Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl. - I don't want to. - No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road. We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals. How would you handle them? I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army. A royal army? Why should every lord command his own men? We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers, instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives. And if the northerners rebel? I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe. And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord? - For me. I'm their king. - Mm-hm. But you've just invaded their homeland, - asked them to kill their brothers. - I'm not asking. The North cannot be held, not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. And when the winter comes, the seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good king knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies. So you agree the Starks are enemies? Everyone who isn't us is an enemy. Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food. - I'm practicing. - Practicing for what? - The prince. - Arya, stop! He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend. The Hound killed your friend. The Hound does whatever the prince tells him to do. - You're an idiot. - You're a liar, and if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive. Enough! What's happening here? Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady. Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love. The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it? I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. - May I be excused? - You've barely eaten a thing. It's all right. Go on. War was easier than daughters. Go away! Arya, open the door. May I come in? - Whose sword is that? - Mine. Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. - Little ladies shouldn't play with swords. - I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady. Come here. Now what do you want with this? It's called Needle. Oh, a blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting? Stick 'em with the pointy end. That's the essence of it. I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault. No, sweet girl. No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy. I hate them. I hate all of them. The Hound, the queen and the king and Joffrey and Sansa. Sansa was dragged before the king and queen and asked to call the prince a liar. So was I! He is a liar. Shh, darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong. But how you can let her marry someone like that? Well Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words. Winter is coming. You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister. I don't hate her. Not really. I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours. I can keep it? Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it. Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. - I know a story about a crow. - I hate your stories. I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites. Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones. Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die, all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the white walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the white walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds What are you telling him now? Only what the little lord wants to hear. Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber. Maybe we do. How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain A thousand times. - You never fall. - I did though. It's true, isn't it, what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead. - Don't ever say that. - I'd rather be dead. Fewer eyes back here, my lady. But still too many. It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came, either. My lady. Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us? I would. We've done nothing wrong. We've been instructed to escort you into the city. Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but Follow me, Lady Stark. Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a Pssst! I meant no disrespect, to you of all people. How dare you bring me here? Have you lost your mind? No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what you wanted? I'm truly sorry about the locale. How did you know I was coming to King's Landing? A dear friend told me. - Lady Stark. - Lord Varys. To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands. How did you know I was coming? Knowledge is my trade, my lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere even in the North. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel. Do you know whose dagger this is? I must admit I do not. Well, well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. - It's mine. - Yours? At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger. To whom? Tyrion Lannister. The Imp. Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of. If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us? Next! Next! Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up! There's only so much I can stomach in a day. A charming man. I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch. And how's that going, Commander Mormont? Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son. Good news or bad? Both. Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning. Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife. - My wife is in Winterfell. - Is she? Yes, I'm looking at you. I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own. You're a funny man. Huh? A very funny man. Ned! Ah, the Starks Quick tempers, slow minds. You broke my nose, bastard! It's an improvement. If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit. I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did. What are you looking at, halfman? I'm looking at you. Yes. You've got an interesting face. Hmm, very distinctive faces. All of you. And what do you care about our faces? It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write to my sister, the queen, about it. We'll talk later, Lord Snow. Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same. Grenn's father left him too outside a farmhouse, when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice - his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories. They hate me because I'm better than they are. It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them had ever held a real sword before they came here. Oh Your brother Bran. He's woken up. The mere suggestion that the queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason. We have proof. We have the blade. Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf. Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me, Ned. He would never betray my trust. I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything. I won't forget this. You're a true friend. Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain. - How could you be so stupid? - Calm down. He's a child. Ten years old. - What were you thinking? - I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. - What has the boy told them? - Nothing. He remembers nothing. Then what are you raving about? What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a ten-year-old. - And my husband? - I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us - \"The War For Cersei's Cunt.\" - Let me go. - Never. - Let me go. - The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the king - the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world. I wish I could see the girls. - It's too dangerous. - Just for a moment. Until we know who our enemies are. I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it. Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof. And if you find the proof? Then I bring it to Robert and hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing. My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday. He still loves you. Does he? Off with you. Yes, it's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first? Of course, Your Grace. Who was it? A Tyroshi. - Never learned the name. - Hmm. How did you do it? Lance through the heart. Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"Wait! Wait.\" They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys, and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing? - It's empty, Your Grace. - What do you mean, it's empty? - There's no more wine. - Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men? One of the outlaws in the brotherhood. I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old. You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw. A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina. Your outlaw any last words? - I cut his head off, so no. - Hmm. What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve? He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours \"Burn them all.\" If that's all, Your Grace Do the Dothraki buy their slaves? The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts. From whom? If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices - pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice. Tell them all to stop. You want the entire horde to stop? For how long? Until I command them otherwise. You're learning to talk like a queen. Not a queen. A khaleesi. You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me? Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi. No. Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect. Please. Please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed. Huh? Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your king! Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi? Uh uh uh uh uh. You walk. I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. - I'm leaving this morning. - You're leaving? I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. - There have been disturbing reports. - What kind of reports? The kind I don't want to believe. I'm ready. I won't let you down. You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon. - But I'm better than every - Better than no one! Here a man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.", "summary": ["Plot Arriving at King's Landing after his long journey, Ned is shocked to learn of the Crown's profligacy from his new advisors. At Castle Black, Jon Snow impresses Tyrion at the expense of greener recruits. Suspicious the Lannisters had a hand in Bran's fall, Catelyn covertly follows her husband to King's Landing, where she is intercepted by Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish. Cersei and Jaime ponder the implications of Bran's recovery; Arya studies swordsmanship. On the road to Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys finds herself at odds with Viserys.  Summary In King's Landing Stark party 1x03 The Stark party arrives in King's Landing.  The royal party reaches King's Landing. Almost immediately, Lord Eddard Stark is asked to attend a meeting of the king's small council and to change his clothes, but he refuses to the latter. Before that he encounters Jaime Lannister in the throne room. Jaime is still unhappy that Eddard judged him dishonorable for killing the Mad King, the murderer of Eddard's father and brother, and for having the nerve to casually seat himself upon the Iron Throne after mayhem was through. Jaime is unrepentant about it. Eddard meets the council members: Lord Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish, the king's Master of Coin and a friend of Eddard's wife from childhood; Grand Maester Pycelle, the king's adviser in all matters scientific and academic; Lord Renly Baratheon, the youngest of the king's two brothers and Master of Laws; and Varys, a eunuch and the Master of Whisperers (the head of the king's intelligence network).  Varys tells Eddard that the council members heard about his \"troubles on the Kingsroad\" and that they pray for Joffrey's recovery. Eddard grimly responds \"It's a shame no one prayed for the butcher's boy\", which visibly upsets Varys.  Eddard is stunned to learn that the crown is six million Gold Dragons in debt, half of which is to Lord Tywin Lannister. To make matters worse, King Robert has just ordered a lavish tournament to celebrate Eddard's appointment. He resolves to advise Robert to cancel the tournament, but the council is doubtful that the king will listen.  Cersei-joffrey Cersei and her son Joffrey.  Queen Cersei talks to Joffrey about the incident on the river. She tells him that when he is king, the truth will be whatever he decides it will be. Joffrey thinks there will be trouble with the Starks, and promises that when he is king, he will double their taxes, force them to contribute to a standing army and, should they object, crush them and install someone loyal, such as his great-uncle Kevan, as Warden of the North. Cersei points out that the North is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders, and a king needs to be more clever. She also advises him to be kind to his betrothed Sansa Stark to avoid stirring up trouble for later, and concludes that \"Anyone who isn't us is an enemy.\"  Arya and Sansa are still at odds over the incident with Joffrey and her direwolf. Eddard explains to Arya that Sansa was put in a difficult position by the king and queen, and while she shouldn't have lied, winning the long-term approval of Joffrey, her future husband, was important. Arya is unhappy with the situation, but Eddard mollifies her by allowing her to practice with her sword, Needle.  Catelyn-arrive Catelyn and Rodrik arrive in King's Landing.  Catelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik arrive at King's Landing and attempt to sneak into the city, but are spotted by one of Littlefinger's men. They are taken to meet Littlefinger at a brothel he owns, where Lord Varys is also waiting. He explains that one of his 'little birds' told him they were coming. Catelyn is angered by the way they've been treated, but asks Littlefinger for aid in finding the people who tried to have Bran killed. Littlefinger is able to answer this quickly stating that the elaborate dagger wielded by the assassin used to be his, but he lost it in a gamble with Tyrion Lannister. Eddard and Petyr 1x03 Eddard threatens Lord Baelish.  Littlefinger fetches Eddard to meet his wife, but Eddard suspects a trick and pushes Littlefinger up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is. Catelyn then appears, and Eddard is pacified. After hearing her news, he vows to find the truth and expose the Lannisters to Robert. Littlefinger agrees to be his ally in this, for the affection he once bore Catelyn as a youngster.  Ravens arrive at King's Landing with news of Bran's recovery. Cersei fears he will expose their secret, but Jaime comforts her, confident they can outwit a child if need be.  Jaime and Cersei 1x03 Jaime comforts Cersei.  Elsewhere, Robert swaps old war stories with Ser Barristan Selmy, a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the Kingsguard. Summoning Jaime Lannister, Robert jokingly questions him about Aerys Targaryen's death, wondering if the Mad King died begging for mercy, but Jaime rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he'd been saying since the siege of King's Landing began: \"Burn them all\".  Eddard has contracted a swordmaster, Syrio Forel, the former First Sword of Braavos, to teach Arya how to use her sword properly. Arya is thrilled, and 'the dance' begins. As Eddard watches them practice, his pleasure at seeing Arya happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the Starks and Lannisters may be inevitable; his daughter may well be training herself for war.  At Winterfell Bran and Old Nan 1x02 Old Nan tells Bran of winter and the Long Night.  At Winterfell, Bran has awoken but has no memory of his accident. His injuries have left him bedridden and unlikely to walk again. Old Nan, the oldest servant in the castle, tells Bran stories to pass the time, but he doesn't want her usual heroic stories about the likes of Ser Duncan the Tall. She instead speaks of the White Walkers and the coming of a vast winter that will blanket the world. When Robb pays a visit, Bran asks his brother if it is true that he will never walk again. Robb reluctantly says this is so. Bran remarks that he would rather be dead.  At the Wall At Castle Black, the primary redoubt of the Night's Watch in the shadow of the Wall, Jon Snow shows his worth to the trainer, Ser Alliser Thorne, by besting several fellow members of the Watch in the practice yard. Thorne is disgusted at the poor performance of the others but has no praise for Jon either, dubbing him Lord Snow and describing him as \"the least useless person here\". Watching over the new recruits with Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Tyrion notes Thorne's stern and unusual ways, but Jeor doesn't care as he only requires Thorne to turn the \"thieves and runaways\" into men of the Night's Watch. Later on, several of the other recruits gang up on Jon, but the situation is defused by Tyrion. Tyrion points out to Jon that none of the other recruits had the benefit of a skilled master-at-arms to train them, and that Jon is alienating them through his standoffish attitude and superior combat skills.  Jon and Benjen 1x03 Benjen talks with Jon on the Wall.  Benjen Stark meets Jon atop the Wall and tells him he is going on a ranging in the Haunted Forest. He refuses to take Jon with him, telling him he isn't ready, and that here rank and nobility mean nothing. Every man must earn everything he gets. Before departing, Benjen stops by the eating area to say farewell to Yoren, a fellow Night's Watchman who scouts for new recruits in the capital. Benjen also scolds Tyrion for his naivety regarding what is north of the Wall and states that Tyrion has no authority to say what is or isn't beyond the Wall as he hasn't been out there himself.  Later, Tyrion discusses north of the Wall with Jeor Mormont and his chief adviser, the ancient and blind Maester Aemon. Jeor asks for Tyrion to intercede at court and get the Watch more men as they are dangerously undermanned. Aemon warns that the Stark words are right. Winter is coming. It will be more harsh and terrible than any in living memory. More dangerous things than just wildlings might come with it. After all, one of their number swore that the White Walkers had returned ... right up to the moment Ned Stark cut his head off. Tyrion admits his skepticism that supernatural creatures might exist, but he agrees to bring word to his queen.  Before departing for King's Landing, Tyrion fulfills an old ambition by climbing to the top of the Wall and urinating off the edge of it. He and Jon share a moment of fellowship before Tyrion departs for the capital in the company of Yoren.  In the Dothraki Sea Daenerys 1x03 Daenerys rides with the khalasar.  Daenerys commands the khalasar to halt on a whim, exercising her growing authority and power. Viserys does not take well to being commanded and threatens his sister, whereupon he is lassoed around the neck by Rakharo, a Dothraki warrior wielding a whip. Daenerys calms the situation and Viserys is forced to walk, a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding Dothraki. Later, Irri reveals to Daenerys that Daenerys is pregnant. Daenerys relays the news to Khal Drogo and tells him she thinks it will be a boy as they lie naked in each other's arms. Ser Jorah Mormont and Rakharo compare the Westerosi and Dothraki ways of battle: the heavily-armored but slow knights, with longswords good for piercing armor, versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors. Jorah has heard of Rakharo's father, a great warrior, but admits that he disgraced his own father, a man of great honor. When he learns that Daenerys is pregnant, he announces he must split off from the column to ride to the Free City of Qohor, but will rejoin them before they reach Vaes Dothrak.

If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting. - I don't want to go. - Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say. Hodor! - Hodor? - Help Bran down the hall. Hodor. I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit. Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell. Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy? I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away. Then you might learn a lord's courtesy. So it's true. Hello, Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened? He has no memory of that day. - Curious. - Why are you here? Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? - My neck is beginning to hurt. - Kneel, Hodor. - Do you like to ride, Bran? - Yes. Well, I mean I did like to. - The boy has lost the use of his legs. - What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride. - I'm not a cripple. - Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice. - Will I really be able to ride? - You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them. Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him? I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things. You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours. Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier. Couldn't resist some northern arse? If you like Redheads, ask for Ros. Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters. - He's not my master. - No, of course not. What happened here? Where is Lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me? - She wasn't feeling well. - She's not in Winterfell, is she? - Where did she go? - M'lady's whereabouts M'lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. - I believe your uncles were responsible. - Must have been a pretty sight. Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out. - We were outnumbered ten to one. - A stupid rebellion, then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire. - Careful, Imp. - I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out. Shoulder, legs. Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it. What in seven hells is that? They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in. Tell them your name. Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black. Come to take the black pudding. Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. Rast see what he can do. I yield. - Please, no more. - On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. - Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. - Jon! Again, harder. - I yield! - Enough! He yielded. Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, Lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard. - Are you sure you want to do this? - No. Yield, yield, yield! I yield. We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for. - Well fought! - Piss off. - Did he hurt you? - I've had worse. You can call me Sam if you want. - My mother calls me Sam. - It's not going to get any easier, you know? - You're going to have to defend yourself. - Why didn't you get up and fight? I wanted to. - I just couldn't. - Why not? I'm a coward. - My father always says so. - The Wall's no place for cowards. You're right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to thank you. A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too. You're too stupid to be a coward. - You're too stupid to be a - Quick now, before summer's over. Come here! Hyah, hyah! Vaes Dothrak - the city of the horselords. A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs. - Best these savages can do. - These are my people now. - You shouldn't call them savages. - I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army. If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms? The Dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink. But if they did? King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different. - And you know these men? - I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land. You sold slaves. Aye. - Why? - I had no money and an expensive wife. And where is she now? In another place, with another man. - Your Grace? - Yes, my dear? They call you the last dragon They do. You have dragon's blood in your veins? It's entirely possible. What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all. The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them melted together like so many candles. I have always wanted to see a dragon. There's nothing in the world that I would rather see. Really. Why dragons? They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles. Ow. Yes. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy. Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy. I was not locked in. I have seen things. - What have you seen? - I've seen a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. - Ooh. - I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So have you seen one? - A pirate ship? - A dragon. No. No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen - their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong with skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But But as you got closer to the Iron Throne they got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius Archonei, Meraxes, Vhagar and Balerion the Dread whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one. What happened to the skulls? I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind. - That's very sad. - Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? - To make me sad? - No, Your Grace. To, uh, teach your sister. To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? Oh, you pretty little idiot. Go on, then. Get on with it. Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince. - What if I have a girl? - Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them. What if I only have girls? I wouldn't worry about that. Jeyne Poole's mother had five children - all of them girls. Yes, but it's highly unlikely. But what if? Well, if you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother. And everyone would hate me. Nobody could ever hate you. - Joffrey does. - Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? Sansa I've told you a hundred times - - a direwolf is not - Please shut up about it. Do you remember your lessons? - Who built the Iron Throne? - Aegon the Conqueror. - And who built the Red Keep? - Maegor the Cruel. And how many years did it take to build My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they? They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes. - The Mad King. - Commonly known as the Mad King. Why were they killed? You should speak to your father about these matters. I don't want to speak to my father, ever. Sansa, you will find it in your heart - to forgive your father. - No, I won't. It's the Hand's Tournament that's causing all this trouble, my lords. The King's Tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it. Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters. - Dreadful. - If you can't keep the king's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can. - I need more men. - You'll get 50. - Lord Baelish will see it paid for. - I will? You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you - till the crowds have left. - Thank you, my lord Hand, ser. They will be put to good use. The sooner this is over, the better. The realm prospers from such events, my lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes. And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged. I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. - Hmm. - Now if there's nothing else, my lords? Oh, this heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners, your summer snows. Until tomorrow, my lord. I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn. Lord Arryn? Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. - Lord Jon often came to me for counsel. - Why? I have been grand maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since What did Jon want the night before he died? Oh, he came inquiring after a book. A book? What book? Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord. A A ponderous tome. No, I'd like to read it. The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children. Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the Last Hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt. As I said, my lord, a ponderous read. Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it? He did not, my lord. And I did not presume to ask. - Jon's death - Such a tragedy. did he say anything to you during his final hours? Nothing of import, my lord. Oh. There was one phrase he kept repeating. \"The seed is strong,\" I think it was. - \"The seed is strong\"? - Mmm. - What does that mean? - Oh, the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words. And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness? What else could it be? - Poison. - A disturbing thought. No, no, no, I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon. Yes, women, cravens and eunuchs. Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch? - Everybody knows that. - Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself - on the king's council, I will never know. - I've taken enough of your time. No trouble at all, my lord. It's a great honor. Thank you. I'll find my own way out. Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours. It's a hard fall down these steps. Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. - Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. - Cats? Syrio says. He says every swordsman should study cats. They're as quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. - You have to be quick to catch them. - He's right about that. Now that Bran's awake, will he come live with us? Well, he needs to get his strength back first. He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard. - He can't be one now, can he? - No. But someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king's council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder. Can I be lord of a holdfast? You will marry a high lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords. - Hmm? - No. That's not me. Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well. Come stand by the fire. - It's warmer. - No, that's all right. I'm fine. You're not. You're freezing. I don't like high places. You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam? On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. \"You're almost a man now,\" he said. \"But you're not worthy of my land and title. \"Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, \"forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. \"If you do not,\" he said, \"then we'll have a hunt \"and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble \"and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. \"Or so I'll tell your mother. \"Nothing would please me more.\" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he? Yes, he is. I'm not going to get any better, you know. Well you can't get any worse. I hear you're reading a boring book. Hmph. - Pycelle talks too much. - Oh, he never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire - Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death. Knighted for what? - Why are you telling me this? - I promised Cat that I'd help you. Where is Ser Hugh? - I'll speak to him. - A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the queen. And do you see that septa pretending to read her book? - Varys or the queen? - No, she's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely? - Yes. - The wiser answer was no, my lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours - discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel. - Why? - I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death. Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you. Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse. 22, 23, - 28, 29 - Ser Hugh? - Ser Hugh! - As you can see, I'm busy. I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King. - I'm the captain of his guard. - I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser - No \"ser\". I'm not a knight. - I see. Well, it just so happens that I am. He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. - He's a knight, you see. - Ah, a knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way. You shouldn't be out here, my lord. - There's no telling who has eyes where. - Let them look. The former Hand did call on me, my lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage. - What did Lord Arryn want? - He always came to see the boy. - I'd like to see him as well. - As you wish, my lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad. - This is fine work. - It's not for sale. Boy, this is the King's Hand! - If his lordship wants the helmet - I made it for me. - Forgive him, my lord. - There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about? He just asked me questions is all, my lord. What kind of questions? About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother. - Your mother? - Who she was, what she looked like. What did you tell him? She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes. Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me. Find anything? King Robert's bastard son. He likes that. This is for the king from Lord Stark. Should I leave it with Shhh. Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Huh? - Guess. - Three. Four. He likes to do this when I'm on duty. He makes me listen as he insults my sister. - Forgive me, my lord - Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me? - We've met before, you know. - Have we? Strange, I've forgotten. The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon. Ah. - That's where you got your scar? - Aye. - Oh. - One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye. - Vicious sons of whores. - They like their bloodshed. They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. Do you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach? With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die. I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop. - Theon? He's a good lad. - I doubt it. I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here. Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark. I don't serve Lord Stark. - Where have you been? - Watch duty. - With Sam. - Ah, Prince Porkchop. - Where is he? - He wasn't hungry. Impossible! That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him. You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon. No one touches Sam. What are you waiting for? Attack him! You get in there. Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield. Yield. I yield. You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy? You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head! Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked. Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us. Yes, Khaleesi. - Why did you hit her?! - How many times do I have to tell you? - You do not command me. - I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper. - What's this? - It's a gift. - I had it made for you. - Dothraki rags? - Are you going to dress me now? - Please. This stinks of manure. All of it. Stop. Stop. Stop it. You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? - Next you'll want to braid my hair. - You've no right to a braid. - You've won no victories yet. - You do not talk back to me! You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands. I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town. I wouldn't doubt it. Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little Sally on the side? - Sally on the side? - It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? - It's absurd. - I didn't think you'd be so upset about it. Why not? Because I'm fat? - No. - But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never been with one. You've probably had hundreds. No. As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you. Yeah. Yeah, I I find that hard to believe. I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but - Didn't know where to put it? - I know where to put it. Was she old and ugly? Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros. What color hair? - Red. - Oh, I like red hair. And her, um Her - You don't want to know. - What, that good? - Better. - Oh, no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect? - What's my name? - Jon Snow. And why is my surname Snow? Because you're a bastard from the North. I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child. Ah, mmm. So you didn't know where to put it? Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys. It is a bit nippy. A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built? - I build my own fires. - That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men - capture them, gather some knowledge. The wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones left over for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment, and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die like flies. I hit him. I hit the dragon. Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake. - He is still the true king. - The truth now. Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne? No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return. The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high lords play. What do you pray for, Ser Jorah? Home. I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home. Lovers' quarrel? I'm sorry. Do I? Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. - He's known - An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long, long time. - Why do they call you Littlefinger? - Arya! - Don't be rude! - No, it's quite all right. When I was a child, I was very small, and I come from a little spit of land called the Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname. I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself! Gods, who's that? Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother. - And his opponent? - Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come. Yes, yes, enough of the bloody pomp. Have at him! Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire - Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story. - I won't tell anyone. I promise. - No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you. My lord, Her Grace the queen.", "summary": ["Plot Ned looks to a book for clues to the death of his predecessor, and uncovers one of King Robert's bastards. Robert and his guests witness a tournament honoring Ned. Jon takes measures to protect Sam from further abuse at Castle Black; a frustrated Viserys clashes with Daenerys in Vaes Dothrak; Sansa imagines her future as a queen, while Arya envisions a far different future. Catelyn rallies her husband's allies to make a point, while Tyrion finds himself caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Summary In the North Tyrion and Bran 1x04 Tyrion speaks with Bran.  In Winterfell, Bran Stark has a nightmare in which he sees a raven with three eyes, sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the Stark crypts. He wakes up to find his direwolf Summer by his side. Theon Greyjoy summons Hodor, the castle's dim-witted stableboy, who can only say the word \"Hodor\", to help carry Bran down to the great hall, where Robb Stark is hosting a meeting with Tyrion Lannister and Yoren, both traveling down from the Wall to King's Landing together. Robb very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the Watch, silently letting Tyrion know he is not invited to stay at Winterfell.  When Bran arrives, Tyrion asks if he likes to ride and sympathizes with him for being a cripple, which annoys Bran, but Tyrion simply says that like being a dwarf, it is the truth, no less so for being a hard truth. He gives Bran the design of a saddle which will allow Bran to ride even in his current state; Tyrion explains to Robb that \"you must shape the horse to the rider,\" by starting with a yearling and training it to respond to the reins and Bran's voice (as he can't use his heels). He does it to repay Bran's half-brother's friendship and because he has a weakness for \"cripples, bastards and broken things.\" Due to this kindness, Robb says he can stay, but Tyrion says he would prefer the brothel in town. As he prepares to leave the castle, Theon comes to Tyrion and rather condescendingly sends him off, recommending the prostitute Ros at the brothel. Tyrion asks Theon why Lady Catelyn was not present to receive him and concludes that Catelyn is not in Winterfell. He also taunts Theon about how the son of the ferocious Balon Greyjoy has been reduced to playing lackey in Winterfell to his captors, which infuriates Theon, and gives him a coin, assuming that he has not already had sex with Ros.  At the Wall Jon, Sam and Pyp Samwell Tarly joins the new recruits at Castle Black.  At Castle Black, a new recruit for the Night's Watch has arrived: Samwell Tarly, the son of the famous Lord Randyll Tarly. Samwell is fat, soft and pampered, and in his first practice fight does dismally. Ser Alliser Thorne has no time for his weakness. He directs the other recruits to attack 'Ser Piggy', but Jon Snow finds this cruel and unfair, and takes pity on Sam and fends off the attackers. Thorne tries to turn it into a game, ordering three trainees take on Sam's protector (taunting Jon that he has found a new Lady love), but Jon nevertheless fends them all off. Samwell is naive and self-deprecating, claiming to be a coward and craven, to Jon's astonishment. No one admits to being a coward, and Grenn says that they shouldn't even be seen talking to him.  Sam joins Jon on the Wall for sentry duty, even though he says his eyesight is weak, he is afraid of heights, and can't take the cold. Jon asks why he joined the Night's Watch as he is afraid of everything. Sam tells him that on his eighteenth nameday his father offered him a choice. Sam was a man and his heir, but he was not skilled at combat, he was unworthy of his name and birthright. Samwell's father forced him to join the Night's Watch, and told him that if he refused, he would arrange a \"hunting trip\" with his son in the woods, and implied that Sam would be killed in a way that looked accidental. Jon is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a bastard. Sam knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad.  Grenn-yield Grenn yields to Samwell.  At the Wall, Jon orders the recruits to go easy on Sam, but Rast refuses, saying that if Ser Alliser orders him to fight 'Lady Piggy', he will slice himself off a side of bacon. In response to Rast's comments, Jon goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf Ghost to intimidate Rast into playing along. The next day, no one will fight Sam. After Grenn takes a very weak blow from Sam and yields, Ser Alliser scolds Jon for his rebellious actions. Later, when Jon and Sam are cleaning the dining hall, they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman. Sam tells Jon that he has not had success with girls, while Jon reveals he'd rather not risk siring a child that will have the life of a bastard like himself. A furious Alliser Thorne comes in and tells Jon that this charity won't help Sam harden up to survive the winter that is coming. He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the Wall that ended in cannibalism.  At Vaes Dothrak Khal Drogo's khalasar arrives at Vaes Dothrak, the Dothraki city. There are no city walls, but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses. Viserys is annoyed that Drogo has been taking 'his' army in the wrong direction. Later, he bathes with Doreah and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the Targaryen dragons and his own destiny. He recites the names of several dragons, and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at King's Landing, but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons, reminding him that they are dead. He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence.  Viserys is enraged when Daenerys sends Doreah with an invite for him to dine with her, as he interprets this as his sister commanding him to come. He drags Doreah into Daenerys' tent, and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him. He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from Pentos, having refused to dress like a Dothraki, whom he regards as savages. He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a Dothraki. Angered by his ingratitude, Daenerys retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle, which further infuriates him. In his anger, Viserys tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her, calling her nothing but a \"horselord's slut\", and warning her that she's \"awoken the Dragon\", but this time she fights back, hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt. She tells a stunned Viserys, who can only gawp at her in astonishment, that she is the Khal's wife, and is carrying his child (and by implication, Viserys is nothing to the Dothraki), and warns that if he raises a hand against her again, he will lose his hands. Later, Daenerys confides in Mormont her realization that Viserys will never become King of Westeros. He is so weak and ineffectual that he couldn't command an army even if Drogo gave him one, to which Jorah agrees.  In King's Landing In the Red Keep, Sansa Stark visits the Great Hall, where the Iron Throne sits. She and Septa Mordane discuss the expectation that Sansa will have to provide Joffrey with an heir. Sansa thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters, along with her belief Joffrey is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over Lady's death.  Small Council The small council meets.  During a meeting of the small council, Lord Eddard learns that the forthcoming tournament to celebrate his appointment is seeing the city swell with visitors, and has already resulted in a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race. He tells Littlefinger that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards, as well as lending twenty of his own men to Janos Slynt's command, until the tournament is over. After the meeting Eddard talks to Grand Maester Pycelle about Jon Arryn's last few weeks. Pycelle said he did all he could to save Jon Arryn, but the illness was sudden and severe. He recalls that shortly before his sudden illness, Arryn had borrowed a truly boring book about the lineages of the Seven Kingdoms, and his last words were, \"The seed is strong.\"  Taking the book with him, Eddard comes across Arya in the hall standing on one leg as part of her training with Syrio. Arya asks whether Bran would be able to live in King's Landing with them now that he's awoken, but Eddard states that he would have to regain his strength first. Arya then comments that Bran had always wanted to be a knight in the King's Guard, but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis. Eddard confirms this to be the case, but states that Bran will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast, sit on the King's council, or raise castles. When Arya asks if she would be able to become any of those, Eddard instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons. However, Arya is not pleased with this response, telling her father, \"that's not me.\" She goes back to balancing on one leg as Eddard looks on.  Eddard and Petyr 1x04 Petyr talks with Eddard.  Littlefinger meets with Eddard and suggests that he keep his investigation into Jon Arryn's death lower in profile. He also gives Eddard some interesting intelligence: Jon Arryn's former squire has been knighted and will fight in the forthcoming Hand's tourney. He also advises him to investigate an armorer located in the city. Eddard decides that Littlefinger may be more trustworthy than he first thought, but Littlefinger discourages him from thinking that way. Eddard sends Jory Cassel to question Jon Arryn's former squire, Ser Hugh of the Vale. However, deducing that Jory was not a knight, Ser Hugh simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank. Eddard's investigation leads him to a smithy in the city, where he meets master smith Tobho Mott and his apprentice Gendry, whose work Jon Arryn was also apparently interested in. Mott has Gendry show Eddard a bull's head helm he made as a sample of his work which Eddard commends, but Gendry adds that it's not for sale. Mott scolds him but Gendry states he made it for himself, and Eddard assures Mott he's not offended.  Gendry tells him that Jon would drop by and ask other questions as well, such as if he liked being at Mott's smithy and if he was treated well, then on who his mother was. Studying his face, Eddard realizes that Gendry is one of King Robert's bastard sons, but can't work out why Jon Arryn would be interested in this: Robert has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them. On leaving, he tells Mott that if Gendry should become interested in wielding a sword instead of forging them, to send him to Eddard.  Later, Eddard sends Jory with a message for King Robert, but upon arriving at his quarters, Jory hears the voices of a number of women coming from Robert's chamber. Ser Jaime Lannister happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside, flaunting his dishonorable treatment of Jaime's sister in his face. He and Jory reminisce about the Greyjoy Rebellion, in which they both fought for King Robert's forces to put down an attempt by Balon Greyjoy (Theon's father) to secede the Iron Islands from the rest of the realm. Jory tries to leave Eddard's message with Jaime, but is rebuffed, as Jaime angrily states that he does not serve Lord Stark.  Cripples-Bastards-and-Broken-Things-sansa-stark-23083167-1280-720 Littlefinger, Arya, Sansa and Septa Mordane at the tournament.  The tournament begins and Sansa watches from the stands. Ser Gregor Clegane, the elder brother of Sandor Clegane, the Hound, takes the field. His first joust is with Ser Hugh. However, the friendly joust turns nasty and Gregor kills Ser Hugh \"by accident\", with a splinter of the lance impaling his neck. Littlefinger sits next to Sansa, and remarks that she and Joffrey have had a lover's quarrel (as Joffrey is still giving her the cold shoulder). Baelish then tells Sansa that Gregor, the \"Mountain That Rides\", has a dark reputation: he pushed his little brother Sandor's face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young, burning him severely. Littlefinger recommends that Sansa not spread that story around.  Cersei visits Eddard at his chambers, remarking at how the Hand is not at his own tournament. Though Cersei attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the Kingsroad behind them, Eddard correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit. Cersei then wonders aloud to Eddard what his true purpose is for being at King's Landing, as she knows how little Starks enjoy being in the capital. When Eddard tells her he is there to faithfully serve their King, Cersei remarks that just as his brother Brandon was born to lead, Eddard was born to follow.  At the Inn at the Crossroads At the Crossroads Inn, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel, traveling in secret to Winterfell, are eating a meal while troubadour Marillion tries to ingratiate himself with them. They are surprised when Tyrion Lannister and Yoren arrive. When told there is no vacancy, Tyrion holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him; sellsword Bronn agrees to give his to Tyrion. Marillion draws the attention of Tyrion to Catelyn's table, by offering to serenade him while he eats, singing of his father's military victories. Tyrion is surprised to see Catelyn and inadvertently ends her anonymity. Catelyn tells the stunned inn that Tyrion tried to murder her son Bran twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king's justice. The inn is located in the Riverlands, in the territory controlled by her father, so the knights present owe him their fealty. Tyrion finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords, and in Catelyn's custody."], "review": null}, "4": {"id": "s01e05", "name": "The Wolf and the Lion", "script": "Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital? No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else. He'd never worn this armor before. Bad luck for him - going against the Mountain. Who determines the draw? All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark. Aye. But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters. Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident. I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan. As is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her. You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights. My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat. He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime. And that lad - he was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor? Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? - I hear the king wants to joust today. - Yes, that will never happen. Robert tends to do what he wants. If the king got what he wanted all the time, he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion. It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go. Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly. - You're too fat for your armor. - Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king? Oh, it's funny, is it? - No, Your Grace. - No? You don't like the Hand's joke? You're torturing the poor boy. You heard the Hand. The king's too fat for his armor. Go find the breastplate stretcher - now! \"The breastplate stretcher\"? How long before he figures it out? - Maybe you should have one invented. - All right, all right. You watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance. You've no business jousting. Leave that for the young men. Why, because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody! - And who's going to hit you back? - Anybody who can. - And the last man in his saddle - Will be you. There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you. Are you telling me those cowards would let me win? Aye. - Drink. - I'm not thirsty. Drink. Your king commands it. Gods, too fat for my armor. Your squire - a Lannister boy? Mm. A bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. \"Cersei Lannister will make a good match,\" he told me. \"You'll need her father on your side.\" I thought being king meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this. Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood. - Robert. - What? Oh. An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come, bow before your king! Bow, you shits! - Where's Arya? - At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers. Thank you, Ser Loras. Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him. - Hey. - I can't watch. A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain. - I'll take that bet. - Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys? - Or you could even buy a friend. - He's going to die. Ser Loras rides well. Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend. And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend? Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really. Ser Loras would never do that. - There's no honor in tricks. - No honor and quite a bit of gold. Sword! Leave him be! Stop this madness in the name of your king! Let him go! I owe you my life, ser. I'm no ser. Remove his hood.  On that eve, the captive Imp  Downwards from his horse did limp  No more would he preen and primp  In garb of red and gold  This isn't the Kingsroad. - You said we were riding for Winterfell. - I did Often and loudly. Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me? - And why would I do that? - Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a shadowcat ate me first. Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns. Ah, the eastern road. We're going to the Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister? - Five years ago. - She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now You might as well kill me here. - I am not a murderer, Lannister. - Neither am I. I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life. - The dagger found - What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade? - Should I gag him? - Why? Am I starting to make sense? Rodrik! My lady, this way. Untie me. If I die, what's the point? Ah! - Rodrik? - I'll be fine, my lady. There's no need to bloody yourself. Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight. I'm willing if she is. Bran. The Iron Islands. Sigil - a kraken. Words - \"We do not sow.\" - Lords? - The Greyjoys. Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking. And failed rebellions. Sigil - a stag, a crowned stag now that Robert's king. - Good. - Words - \"Ours is the fury.\" - Lords - the Baratheons. - Mm-hm. The Westerlands. - Sigil - a lion. - Mmm. - Words - \"A Lannister always pays his debts.\" - No. A common saying, but not their official motto. Lords - the Lannisters. - We're still on their words. - I don't know them. You do know them. Think. \"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken.\" - That's House Martell. - \"Righteous in wrath.\" - House Hornwood. - \"Family, duty, honor.\" Those are Tully words - your mother's. - Are we playing a game? - Family, duty, honor - Is that the right order? - You know it is. Family comes first? Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family. How can she protect the family if she's not with her family? Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept. And then she left! When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. - Fiercely. - Why did she leave? I still can't tell you, - but she will be home soon. - Do you know where she is now? Today? - No, I don't. - Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon? Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good. I'll never shoot another arrow. And where is that written? - You need legs to work a bow. - Hmm. If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback. Really? Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you? Shh, keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls. I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here. Important enough for the likes of you. You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know. Who, the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman. Jealous? Why should I be jealous? Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered. - Might surprise you. - Hmm? He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue. Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister. You are jealous. I'm a Greyjoy. We've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters. And what about the Starks? I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old. A ward - that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again My father fought for the freedom of his people. What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore. You're a very serious boy. - I'm not a boy. - Oh, yes, you are. A serious boy with a serious cock. I don't want to pay for it. Then get yourself a wife. Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you. How is your son, my lord? He'll never walk again. But his mind is sound? So they say. A blessing, then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever others open in most unexpected places. May I? If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the king is a fool - your friend, I know, but a fool - and doomed unless you save him. I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this? I didn't trust you. So why do you trust me now? The queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem. What sort of doom does the king face? The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace. Who gave it to him? Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy. All he was he owed to Jon Arryn. The squire, Ser Hugh? Pity, what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely. If Ser Hugh poisoned him who paid Ser Hugh? - Someone who could afford it. - Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years - Why kill him? He started asking questions. He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come. And when he knows the truth, what will he do? The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse - they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. - We will be at war soon, my friend. - What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second? This Hand is not the other. We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. - You know what these savages are. - \"Delay,\" you say. \"Move fast,\" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players. It never was. The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry. You do move quietly. We all have our qualities. You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. - First boy is on the house. - I think you're mistaking - business with pleasure. - Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear - such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations. Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear. I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion - both equally important. Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees? All desires are valid to a man with a full purse. And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot. Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the king's laws. Strictly speaking. Tell me. Does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered. Do you know, I have no idea where they are. And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other? Since you last saw me or since I last saw you? Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King. - Saw me with your own eyes? - Eyes I own. Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark. Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion to think a simple word to the queen - One shudders at the thought. - Ooh. But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me. - Have you? - Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers. Was that you under the bed? And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary Council business? Of course, you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the king might question my friend's sympathies. To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right loyalty to the realm - Oh, please. - To find myself in a position where a simple word to the king What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. - My brother is coming. - To a small council meeting? Disturbing news from far away. Hadn't you heard? Off with you. No begging. I'm not a beggar. I live here. D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing? I want to see my father. I want to fuck the queen, for all the good it does me. You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends. My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell. And if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes. Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing? You know I had half my guard out searching for you? - You promised me this would stop. - They said they were going to kill you. - Who did? - I didn't see them, - but I think one was fat. - Oh, Arya. I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage Something about the savage. - Where did you hear this? - In the dungeons, - near the dragon skulls. - What were you doing in the dungeons? Chasing a cat. Pardon, my lord. There's a night's watchman here begging a word. Says it's urgent. - Your name, friend? - Yoren, if it please. - This must be your son. He has the look. - I'm a girl! Did Benjen send you? No one sent me, my lord. I'm here to find men for the Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service. - Oh, we'll find recruits for you. - Thank you, my lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black - makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse. There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow. Know what? Best said in private, my lord. Go on. We'll talk more later. Jory, take her safely to her room. Come along, my lady. You heard your father. - How many guards does my father have? - Here in King's Landing? Fifty. You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you? No fear on that count, little lady. - Well? - It's about your wife, my lord. She's taken the Imp. You're far from home, Lady Stark. - To whom do I speak? - Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale. - Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit? - There was no time to send word. May I ask, my lady, why he is with you? That's why there was no time. - He is my prisoner. - He doesn't look like a prisoner. My sister will decide what he looks like. Yes, my lady. She will at that. The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable. Give me ten good men and some climbing spikes, I'll impregnate the bitch. I like you. Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called. I need to see the king first - alone. The king is at the small council meeting, my lord. He has summoned you. - Is it about my wife? - No, my lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen. - The whore is pregnant. - You're speaking of murdering a child. I warned you this would happen, back in the North. I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead. You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this. Honor?! I've got seven kingdoms to rule! One king, seven kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? - It's fear - fear and blood. - Then we're no better than the Mad King. - Careful, Ned. Careful now. - You want to assassinate a girl because the spider heard a rumor? No rumor, my lord. The princess is with child. - Based on whose information? - Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens. Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact? Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man. He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man? And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army - - what then? - The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water. Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores? You're my council. Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool. I understand your misgivings, my lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, - the realm will bleed. - I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live? We should have had them both killed years ago. When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it. I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child. She dies. I will have no part in it. You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will. And good luck to him. - I thought you were a better man. - Out. Out, damn you. I'm done with you. Go, run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war! I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. - Don't ask anyone for help. - Right away, my lord. Lord Baelish is here for you. His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word \"treason\" was mentioned. - What can I do for you? - When do you return to Winterfell? - Why? What do you care? - If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you. I don't have the time. It won't take more than an hour. But as you please. Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. - Who are your best two swords? - Heward and Wyl. Find them and meet me at the stables. You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were \"The seed is strong.\" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the lord of all the Vale. Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, - warning me - To stay away from them! Not to bring one here! Mummy - is that the bad man? - It is. He's little. He's Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King! Oh, did I kill him too? - I've been a very busy man. - You will watch your tongue! These men are knights of the Vale. Every one of them loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me. If any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do. You can't hurt us. No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy! - Tell him! - Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby. Mummy I want to see the bad man fly. - Perhaps you will, my little love. - This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed. Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord. You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf man! Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head. Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. - He adores the man. - You're jealous. - Are you sure this won't hurt? - Only if I slip. - And you'd prefer me like this? - Mm-hm. If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy. I want you. My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours? Hold still. All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood. You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee. His eye was dangling out of the damn socket! He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight. Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman. It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it - every day of my life since I could hold a stick. I could work at fighting all day, every day, I'd still never be as good as you. Yes, well, I guess we'll never know. - Everywhere? - Everywhere. So how did it end up? - The Targaryen girl will die? - It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches. It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife. He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters - they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money. - I have an outrageous amount of money. - Not as much as the Lannisters. But a lot more than you. Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks. Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day, all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh. Oh. But Robert loves his killing. - And he's the king. - Hmm. - How did that ever happen? - Because he loves his killing. And he used to be good at it. Do you know who should be king? - Be serious. - I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, - but I'd fight for you. - I'm fourth in line. And where's Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight. - Stannis? - Stannis has the personality of a lobster. He's still my older brother. - What are you doing?! - Look at it. - You cut me. - It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become king, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you. You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared? You would be a wonderful king. I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together. I'm glad I could do something to make you happy. Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces. I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime. No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Hmm. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way? I don't know. But I do know this - if the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea we won't be able to stop them. The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. - They don't have siege weapons. - It's a neat little trick you do - you move your lips and your father's voice comes out. Is my father wrong? Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles. A wise move - only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee king, their cowardly king hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all? We still outnumber them. Which is the bigger number - five or one? Five. Five One. One army - a real army united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow. What do you want? We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Backstabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now - backstabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together. Our marriage. Ah, so here we sit, holding it all together. Don't you get tired? Every day. How long can hate hold a thing together? Well, 17 years is quite a long time. Yes, it is. What was she like? You've never asked about her, not once. Why not? At first, just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you. As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it. So why now? What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over? You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted. Someone took her away from me, and seven kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind. I felt something for you once, you know? I know. Even after we lost our first boy. For quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment? No. Does that make you feel better or worse? It doesn't make me feel anything. She looks like him, don't she, my lord? She has his nose, his black hair. Aye. Tell him when you see him, my lord. If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is. - I will. - And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The king was always good to me. When Jon Arryn came to visit you, - what did he want? - He wasn't that sort of man, my lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy. Looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing. Brothels make a much better investment than ships, I've found. Whores rarely sink. What do you know of King Robert's bastards? Well, he has more than you, for a start. - How many? - Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents. And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why? He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.", "summary": ["Plot Incensed over news of Daenerys's alliance with the Dothraki, Robert orders a preemptive strike on the Targaryens that drives a wedge in his relationship with Ned. A captive Tyrion helps Catelyn, but receives a cold reception at the Eyrie from her sister, Jon Arryn's widow Lysa. Sansa is charmed by the dashing Ser Loras Tyrell, a.k.a. the Knight of Flowers. Arya overhears a plot against her father.  Summary In the Vale In the hills Tyrion Lannister and his escorts in the hills of the Vale.  Tyrion Lannister has his blindfold removed and finds that their party, augmented by several knights and the sellsword Bronn from the Crossroads Inn, is on the Eastern Road en route to the Vale of Arryn. Catelyn had been saying that they were riding for Winterfell often and very loudly. Tyrion congratulates her on her cunning, while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return, a point that clearly piques Bronn's interest. Tyrion says that Lady Lysa Arryn has gone mad since her husband's death and will try to kill him in the Eyrie. He demands his innocence be known in the attempt on Bran's life and points out he'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade. Before Catelyn can answer, the party comes under attack from one of the hill tribes. Despite taking several losses, the party is able to drive off the attackers. Though having the opportunity to escape, Tyrion fights, killing his first man in the skirmish, and in doing so, saves Catelyn's life. Afterwards, they resume their trek to the Eyrie.  Tyrion, Cat and Vardis at the Eyrie Tyrion and Catelyn in the Eyrie's High Hall.  In the High Hall of the Eyrie, Lady Lysa Arryn holds court on behalf of her young son, Robin. Lysa is furious that Cat has endangered them all by bringing Tyrion to the Vale. Tyrion points out that if he is harmed, there will be war with House Lannister, but Lysa is unconcerned about his threats, as the Vale is strongly-defended and the Eyrie is impregnable. She orders him sent to the sky cells: three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside. This forces Tyrion to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep.  In the North Bran and Luwin Bran and Maester Luwin discuss geography.  In Winterfell, Bran is angry about his mother's absence. Maester Luwin tries to set his mind at rest about the matter, to no avail. However, when Bran gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery, Luwin suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow, of the kind used in mounted combat by the Dothraki, a notion which pleases Bran. Elsewhere in the castle, Theon Greyjoy enjoys the attentions of his favorite whore, Ros, but becomes annoyed when she compares his prowess unfavorably to that of Tyrion Lannister.  In King's Landing Lord Eddard Stark arrives at the tourney ground to speak to Lord Commander Barristan Selmy about the death of Ser Hugh of the Vale. Barristan notes that he had no family or friends so he stood the knight's vigil himself for Ser Hugh. Eddard is suspicious of Ser Hugh's death, wanting to know how he could afford a new set of armor so soon after being made a knight. Barristan reflects on the irony of them being on opposite sides of the war during Robert's Rebellion and now they are working together.  Barristan and Eddard Ser Barristan Selmy and Lord Eddard Stark discuss the death of Ser Hugh.  He also tells Eddard that King Robert is planning to joust during the day's activities. Ned finds King Robert tormenting his squire, Lancel Lannister, finally sending him off on a snipe hunt in amused disgust. Robert is adamant about fighting in the joust but Ned tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win. This frustrates Robert but he is forced to admit that Ned is right but at least they can watch the joust from the stands.  The first tilt of the day is between the fearsome Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain, and the popular 'Knight of the Flowers', Ser Loras Tyrell. Loras gives a beautiful flower to Sansa Stark, while Littlefinger and Lord Renly make a wager on who will win with Renly betting on Loras. Loras is riding a mare that is in heat, which agitates and excites the Mountain's stallion, causing him to throw his rider.  Robert and Lancel King Robert Baratheon is dismayed to find he no longer fits his armor.  Enraged at having lost, Gregor first decapitates his horse and then attacks Ser Loras. Sandor Clegane comes to Loras's defense, preventing his brother from killing him. They exchange several blows, until King Robert orders them to cease. Sandor immediately bows to the king, while Gregor storms off the field. Ser Loras declares Sandor the victor of the match to the Hound's discomfort.  In the Red Keep, Lord Varys meets with Eddard. Varys tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be dead unless Ned can save him. Ned wants to know why Varys is telling him this now. Varys tells him he had to be sure Ned could be trusted .He calls Ned an honorable and true man, maybe the only one in the city. He also confirms that Jon Arryn was assassinated with a poison called the Tears of Lys because he \"started asking questions\".  Later, Arya is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training. She chases one into the dungeons under the castle, where she finds the great dragon skulls of the Targaryens in storage. She hears two men talking: Varys and Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos. Varys says that events have been set in motion and the lion and the wolf will soon be at each other's throats. War is almost upon the Seven Kingdoms, as they planned, but it has come too soon. Khal Drogo will not invade Westeros until his son is born and pronounced healthy, which is still many months away. Illyrio suggests assassinating Eddard to forestall the war, but Varys refuses. Sandor, Gregor &amp; Loras 1x05 Sandor, Ser Gregor and Ser Loras at the tournament.  Afterwards, Varys finds Littlefinger in the Great Hall staring at the Iron Throne. Varys reveals that he knows about Littlefinger's assistance in Eddard's investigation of Jon Arryn's death and reminds Littlefinger of the consequences that may befall him should the Lannisters discover his involvement. In response, Littlefinger reveals that he already knows about Varys having met with both Eddard and Illyrio just earlier that day, implying he knows of Varys's allegiances across the Narrow Sea. Their conversation is interrupted by Renly, who informs them that Robert will be joining them at their small council meeting.  Arya escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard but she gets the words muddled up. They are interrupted by Yoren, who has ridden non-stop from the Crossroads Inn to bring Eddard forewarning of Catelyn's arrest of Tyrion Lannister. Ned keeps the information to himself, while Arya asks Jory Cassel about the state of her father's household guard. Jory tells her she does not have to worry about her father's safety.  At the meeting of the small council, King Robert tells Eddard that Daenerys Targaryen is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the Iron Throne. He wants Daenerys, the unborn child, and Viserys dead as soon as possible.  Varys and Illyrio Varys secretly meets Illyrio under the Red Keep.  Eddard states that this act would be dishonorable, cowardly, and beneath their dignity. The other members of the council: Pycelle, Renly, Littlefinger and Varys, all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm. King Robert orders Ned to enact the order. He refuses and resigns as the Hand of the King, to Robert's utter disbelief and fury.  Eddard orders his household to begin packing. As Ned is packing, Littlefinger arrives and offers to take Ned to the last place Jon Arryn went before he \"fell ill\". Ned agrees.  Ser Loras and Lord Renly, who are lovers, meet in a bedchamber where Renly complains as Robert is organizing a hunt in the Kingswood, which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal. Loras urges Renly to claim the crown himself, offering him the allegiance of his rich and powerful family. Renly dismisses the notion, since he is fourth in line to the Iron Throne. Loras points out that Joffrey is a monster, that Tommen is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and Renly's other brother, Lord Stannis, ever becoming king, as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster. He also asserts that the people love Renly and want to serve him because he is kind and doesn't revel in violence as his brothers do.  Queen Cersei and Robert share a rare drink and discuss the Targaryen threat. Surprisingly, Cersei takes Eddard's side, pointing out that the Dothraki cannot cross the Narrow Sea as they have no ships.  Loras and Renly Ser Loras urges Renly to consider his place in the line of succession.  Robert agrees, but if they land and the knights of Westeros take shelter behind their castle walls, the Dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept Viserys as their king regardless. Cersei suggests that the unified armies of the Seven Kingdoms could defeat them but Robert says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of Westeros. Their discussion moves to Lyanna Stark, which surprises Robert, as in seventeen years Cersei has never asked about her. He tells her that Lyanna's death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill. He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold Lyanna's memory has on him, and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like. Cersei says that she felt something for Robert once, even after they lost their first boy, for quite a while. She asks Robert if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers \"no\".  Littlefinger brings Eddard Stark to the last place Jon Arryn went before falling ill, which is one of Littefinger's brothels. There Ned meets another one of Robert's bastards, this time a baby girl and her mother, a blond whore named Mhaegen. Mhaegen remarks that her child has Robert's nose and \"black\" hair. Eddard asks Littlefinger why Jon Arryn was searching for Robert's bastards but he says he doesn't know, offering the half-hearted guess that maybe Robert suddenly took paternal interest in them. Eddard looks skeptical of that reason.  Leaving the brothel, Eddard, Jory Cassel, and the two guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of Lannister guardsmen led by Ser Jaime Lannister. Jaime has heard of Tyrion's arrest and demands an explanation. Ned says that Tyrion was arrested on his orders.  Eddard injured Eddard is stabbed through the leg by a Lannister guardsman. Jaime threatens to kill him but Ned points out that if he does, Tyrion will die as well. Jaime acknowledges that this is true, so he says he will settle for killing Eddard's men instead. Ned's two guards, Heward and Wyl, are killed by Lannister spearmen in the opening seconds of the fight. In response, Ned and Jory fight and kill six of the Lannister soldiers. Jory engages Jaime but is quickly killed when Jaime stabs him through the eye with a dagger. Furious, Ned crosses swords with Jaime. Jaime is shocked and then exhilarated when the older Ned is not as easily defeated as he expected. However, Jaime gradually starts to grow worried as Ned's high level of skill becomes apparent. Just as they are ready to clash again, a Lannister guardsman steps in and stabs Eddard through the leg with a spear, disabling him. Jaime is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman. He departs, telling Ned he wants his brother back."], "review": null}, "5": {"id": "s01e06", "name": "A Golden Crown", "script": "Your pardon, Your Grace.

Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime. He butchered my men. Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime. - Quiet, woman. - Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice. I took you for a king. Hold your tongue. He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown. I shall wear this like a badge of honor. Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again. See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not That was not kingly. If we don't act there will be a war.

Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister. Khaleesi? Oh, Khaleesi! You're hurt. - Not too fast. - Come on, Dancer. When are you gonna tell him? Not now. - Blood for blood. - Come on! You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others. - You're talking about war. - I'm talking about justice. Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army. A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him You want me to march on Casterly Rock? - You're not a boy anymore. - Come on. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't. And it's not your duty, because it's not your House. Where's Bran? I don't know. It's not my House. Robb? All alone in the deep, dark woods. I'm not alone. My brother is with me. I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak? Ooh, that's a pretty pin. Silver. We'll take the pin and the horse. Get down. Be quick about it. I can't. The saddle The straps. What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple? I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell. If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed! Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth. The boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood? Think what Mance would give us. Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne. Drop the knife! Let him go and I'll let you live. Robb. - Robb. - Shut up. Drop the blade! - No, don't. - Do it. Are you all right? Yes. It doesn't hurt. Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done. Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed? He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat. - You don't have the right - To save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it. What about her? Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours. We'll keep her alive. Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord! Dwarf man making noise! How would you like to be rich? Dwarf man still making noise. My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in No gold! Well, I don't have it here. No gold! Fuck off. I don't want to practice today. No? They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords. You are troubled. - Yes. - Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens. I don't like dolls and k You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you are with your trouble when fighting happens more trouble for you. Just so. How can you be quick as a snake or as quiet as a shadow when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. - Do you pray to the gods? - The old and the new. There is only one god and his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - \"Not today.\" She has to eat the whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse. She's doing well. She'll never keep it down. Tell me what she's saying. \"The prince is riding. \"I have heard the thunder of his hooves. \"Swift as the wind he rides. \"His enemies will cower before him \"and their wives will weep tears of blood.\" She's going to have a boy. He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon. \"The stallion who mounts the world.\" The stallion is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd. A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego They love her. Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego She truly is a queen today. Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law. It's not my law. They don't belong to you. Whatever is hers is also mine. Once, perhaps. If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army. - And you have all three. - I need a large army. I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old, and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it. How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth or fear or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go. You can go. You can't have the eggs. You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you? It means everything to me. And yet here you stand. And yet here I stand. Mord! Mord! Noise again! - About the gold - No gold! - No gold. - Listen to me! Listen to me. Sometimes possession is an abstract concept When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine. Where? Where? I don't know where, but when they free me You want free? Go be free. Have you ever heard the phrase \"Rich as a Lannister\"? Of course you have! You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, \"a Lannister always pays his debts.\" If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do. What message? Tell her I wish to confess my crimes. You wish to confess your crimes? Yes, my lady. I do, my lady. The sky cells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man. Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears. If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was 10, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice. When I was 12 I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel Silence! What happened next? What do you think you're doing? Confessing my crimes. Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband - Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King. Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that. You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell with a steeper floor. Is this how justice is done in the Vale? You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the king's justice? I am accused and demand a trial! If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life. I understand the law. We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door. You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment. Then you will leave by one door or the other. No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat. You have that right. My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion. The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death. - I'll fight for you, my lady. - It'll be my honor. - The honor should be mine. - Make the bad man fly! Ser Vardis you're quiet. Don't you want to avenge my husband? With all my heart, my lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice. Agreed. You demanded a trial by combat. Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you. My lady, I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you. I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister. The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here. Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait. The trial will be today. Do I have a volunteer? Anyone? Anyone? I think we can assume that no one is willing I'll stand for the dwarf. More wine, Your Grace? - What was I saying? - Simpler time. It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it simpler, Selmy? - It was, Your Grace. - The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today. - It sounds exhilarating. - Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fuck a Riverlands girl? Once. I think. You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. - We used to call it \"making the eight.\" - Those were some lucky girls. You ever make the eight, Barristan? I don't believe so, Your Grace. Those were the days. Which days, exactly? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground? Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the king. I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight. More wine, Your Grace? They burned most everything in the Riverlands - our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women, then they took 'em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire. Brigands, most likely. They weren't thieves. They didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, Your Grace. It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king. The king is hunting. Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand? These men, were they flying a sigil? - A banner? - None, your Hand. The one who was leading them Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword. That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain. You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane. Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight. I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog. I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife? If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, - it would be - That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital. Well I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion. You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep. As you command. In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings and sentence him to death. My lord This This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return. - Grand Maester Pycelle. - My lord. Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the Crown and a traitor to the realm. A bold move, my lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers. Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister? Fight! Hold! - Attack! Attack! - Come on, Ser Vardis! Attack! Stand and fight, coward! Yes! Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him. What are you doing? Get up! Get up, get up, get up! Raise your sword. Raise it! Get up, man! - On your feet! - Get up! Get up and fight, Ser Vardis! No! Have mercy! Is it over? You don't fight with honor! No. He did. Can I make the little man fly now? Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine. A Lannister always pays his debts. You wear your hair like a real southern lady now. Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South. It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles. My mother isn't from the North. I'm aware of that. Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there? Yes. I have hair. I've never seen it. Would you like to? No. Where are you from anyway? The North or the South? - I come from a very small village in - Oh, wait. I just realized I don't care. - Sansa - Septa. Now you are being rude. My prince. My prince. My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission? It's beautiful, like the one your mother wears. You'll be queen someday. It's only fitting you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness? There's nothing to forgive. You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the salt shore in the South. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now from this day until my last day. Stop. - Stop! - Whoa. - What are you doing? - Going to King's Landing. In a turnip cart? I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor. And you can afford that? Some of my friends are more generous than others. There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing. So I'll have lots of company. Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out. And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands? Don't be a fool. I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back. There's nothing left for me here. Let's go, Steffon. Giddy up. Let me see it one more time! See what? I'm going to miss you! I know. I'm sending you both back to Winterfell. - What? - Listen - What about Joffrey? - Are you dying because of your leg? - Is that why you're sending us home? - What? No. - Please, Father. Please don't. - You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good. This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety. Can we take Syrio back with us? Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen - and have his babies. - Seven hells. When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair. The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father. He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king. Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things. - Wait! - Come on. But it's not fair! \"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.\" \"Axel Baratheon, black of hair.\" \"Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.\" \"Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.\" \"Robert Baratheon, black of hair.\" \"Joffrey Baratheon \"golden-haired.\" Daenerys! Where's my sister? Stop him. Where is she? Hmm? Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast? - Come. - Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon! Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast. Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there. That is no place for a king. You are no king.", "summary": ["Plot Reinstated as the Hand, Ned sits for the King while Robert is on a hunt. Ned issues a decree that could have long-term consequences throughout the Seven Kingdoms. At the Eyrie, Tyrion confesses to his \"crimes,\" and demands that Lysa give him a trial by combat. Joffrey apologizes to Sansa; Viserys receives from Drogo his final payment for Daenerys.  Summary In the Crownlands Lord Eddard Stark wakes up after a long period of unconsciousness, due to the injuries inflicted on him by Jaime Lannister's men. He finds both King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei waiting.  Robert&#039;s hunting party King Robert's hunting party.  Cersei is furious with Eddard's acts in having her brother Tyrion arrested and attacking Jaime in the street. She wants Robert to take action against him, but Robert refuses to condemn him without hearing Eddard's side, and tells her to be silent. When Cersei protests further, and calls Robert a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. He tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and Cersei leaves in anger. Afterwards, Robert restores Eddard to his position as King's Hand, and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to Jaime Lannister. He tells Lord Eddard to end the animosity between House Stark and House Lannister, as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war. He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns.  Arya has another \"dancing\" lesson with Syrio Forel, but isn't in the mood due to Jory's death. Syrio tells her that she may need to fight at any time, not just when she's in the mood. He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness.  King Robert is out hunting, accompanied by his brother Renly, Ser Barristan Selmy and Lancel Lannister. Robert, being supplied with wine by Lancel, becomes drunk and nostalgic, longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition (instead of being hidden schemers). Robert brags about all the women he has bedded, but Renly becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women. Renly calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that Robert is conveniently ignoring. Renly storms off, leaving Ser Barristan to look on concerned, as Lancel keeps up King Robert's wine supply.  In King's Landing, at a meeting of the small council, a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed. Eddard hears tales of a huge knight ravaging the Riverlands. He realizes that it's Ser Gregor Clegane, \"The Mountain\", who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the Riverlands - which are held by House Tully, the former House of his wife Catelyn, who now holds Tyrion captive. Even though King Robert told him to make peace with the Lannisters, Lord Eddard could not bring himself to let this injustice stand. Eddard strips Gregor Clegane of his knighthood, land, and titles, and sends Lord Beric Dondarrion with a retinue of one hundred knights to arrest and execute him in the king's name.  Eddard and the book Eddard discovers the secret Jon Arryn died for.  He also orders Grand Maester Pycelle to send word to Casterly Rock, demanding Lord Tywin Lannister's presence in court to explain his bannerman's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. 'Littlefinger' Petyr Baelish, and Grand Maester Pycelle are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and Eddard's actions against the Lannisters, but Eddard wants to see justice done.  Prince Joffrey comes to apologize to Sansa for the incident on the Kingsroad. He calls her his lady love and gives her a necklace. Sansa forgives him, and they seem reconciled. Sansa is unaware that the Queen put Joffrey up to the apology some time ago.  Eddard decides to send his daughters back to Winterfell. Arya is worried that she must leave Syrio. Sansa protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor, for they are talking about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. Lord Eddard says that he will find someone else for her. Sansa refuses\u2014she is going to marry Joffrey and have lots of golden-haired babies. This gives Eddard pause and sends him back to the book that Jon Arryn was looking at before he died. Consulting the book's entry on House Baratheon, Lord Eddard finds that every time a Baratheon has married, the children have had black hair\u2026right up to Cersei and Robert's children, who are all blond.  In the North Stiv and Osha Stiv and Osha accost Bran near Winterfell.  In Winterfell, Bran has another dream about the Three-Eyed Raven, in which it flies into the castle's crypts. He wakes up to find that Hodor has brought the finished saddle designed by Tyrion. He goes on a ride with Robb and Theon. They have had word from King's Landing about Eddard's injury, Jory's death and Tyrion's capture. Theon thinks that Robb should prepare the North for war, but Robb is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come, and until then will follow his parents' orders to remain in Winterfell. They discover that Bran has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him. Robb finds a group of wildlings threatening Bran and trying to steal his horse. Robb kills two, but another wildling holds Bran with a knife to the throat. Theon shoots him from behind, angering Robb by endangering Bran. The remaining wildling, a woman named Osha, yields and begs for her life. Robb agrees to take her as a prisoner.  Theon 1x06 Theon tells Ros he will miss her as she leaves for King's Landing.  Ros, the prostitute that Theon frequently sees, is departing Winterfell for King's Landing on the back of a turnip cart. Theon stops her and unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay. She explains that war is now imminent and the men (and thus her customer base) of Winterfell are destined to leave soon and probably never return; her departure is thus an economically essential decision. He throws her a coin to get her to raise her skirt one last time. As she rides off he says that he will miss her. She agrees that he will. Tyrion and Mord Tyrion's verbal skills are wasted on Mord.  At the Eyrie At the Eyrie, Tyrion almost rolls out of his sky cell in his sleep, to his consternation. He tries to make a bargain with the gaoler, Mord, to no avail. Tyrion convinces Mord to carry a message to Lady Lysa Arryn and, in exchange, he will give Mord the gold he had with him when he was captured. Lysa summons Tyrion, believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit, but all he confesses to is being a liar, a whoremonger, and a player of disgusting practical jokes. He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder, specifically that of Bran Stark.   Tyrion on trial Tyrion on trial in the Eyrie.  However, Tyrion uses the opportunity of his audience in front of Lysa's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial, and Lysa is shamed into agreeing. Given that Lysa's son is a young boy and wouldn't make a good judge in a formal trial, Tyrion instead demands a trial by combat, which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right. Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat, she asks for a volunteer to be her champion, and Ser Vardis Egen agrees. Egen is unwilling to fight Tyrion however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable. Tyrion names his own champion: his brother Jaime, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. At this Lysa does object, as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present. Tyrion desperately asks for volunteers, and after a long pause during which it seems that Tyrion's cause is lost, the sellsword Bronn steps forward and says he will stand for him. Bronn defeats Vardis Bronn kicks Ser Vardis Egen's corpse out of the Moon Door.  Bronn fights defensively, waiting for Vardis to tire from being dressed in his full armor. Bronn finally gets his chance; he first wounds and then kills Vardis, sending his body rolling out of the \"Moon Door\" that leads to a thousand-foot drop. Lysa complains that Bronn did not fight with honor. Bronn agrees, but indicates that Vardis did fight with honor. Having proven his innocence in the eyes of the gods, Tyrion retrieves his gold from Ser Rodrik and gives it to Mord. When Robin asks if he can make the little man fly now, Tyrion says, \"This little man is going home.\" Bronn and Tyrion are allowed to depart.  At Vaes Dothrak Dany and the egg Daenerys holds a dragon egg.  In Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys Targaryen is studying her dragon eggs. Despite Illyrio's claim that they are now only stone, she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat, and places an egg on a brazier. Nothing happens, to her disappointment. She is removing the egg from the brazier, when Irri comes in and thinks she will burn herself. Irri takes the egg from her, but Daenerys is completely unharmed, and it is Irri who suffers burns on her own hands. Daenerys is summoned by the crones who rule the city, the dosh khaleen, the wives of khals slain in battle. She eats a stallion's raw heart and the crones read the omens. At first it seems Dany won't keep the organ down, but, to both her and Drogo's relief, she is able to compose herself. The crones declare Daenerys and Drogo's son will be \"The Stallion That Mounts The World\", a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in Dothraki history. Daenerys says his name will be \"Rhaego\", for her brother Rhaegar, slain by the usurper Robert Baratheon. Viserys is not impressed and rather disgusted by it all, despite an explanation of the ritual from Jorah Mormont. It is only when the Dothraki are chanting Rhaego's name, and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room, that Viserys realizes they love her.  Jorah and Viserys Jorah prevents Viserys from stealing Dany's eggs.  Jealous of the tribe's worship of his sister, Viserys storms out of the tent. He is later discovered in Daenerys' tent by Ser Jorah Mormont, trying to steal Dany's dragon eggs, but Jorah won't let him. Viserys tells Ser Jorah that to rule one must be feared or loved, and he has never been loved as the Dothraki love Dany. He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys, but he doesn't care. He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army, but he can't get past Ser Jorah and must leave the eggs. Mormont watches him as he leaves.  Drunk, bitter and angry, Viserys interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo. He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to Drogo. He draws his sword, which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city, and threatens Dany and the unborn child, while Irri translates to Drogo.  Viserys&#039; crowning Khal Drogo gives Viserys a golden crown. Drogo responds that he will give Viserys a golden crown \"that men will tremble to behold\", and Viserys is pleased until Drogo's bloodrider Qotho seizes him and breaks his arm, making him drop the sword, and kicks him to the floor. Drogo melts his golden belt of medallions in a pot, while Viserys begs Daenerys to help him. Ser Jorah tells her to look away, but she won't. She watches as Khal Drogo \"crowns\" Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head, causing Viserys to cry out horridly in agony. Viserys falls forward, his head making a loud clang as it connects with the floor. As Daenerys watches her brother die, she coldly states that, having been killed by fire, Viserys was no true dragon."], "review": null}, "6": {"id": "s01e07", "name": "You Win or You Die", "script": "Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain.\" Er \"Arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown.\" Poor Ned Stark. Brave man, terrible judgment. Attacking him was stupid. Lannisters don't act like fools. Are you going to say something clever? Go on, say something clever. Catelyn Stark took my brother. - Why is he still alive? - Tyrion? Ned Stark. One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him. Why is he still alive? It wouldn't have been clean. Clean. You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you. I could care less what anyone thinks of me. That's what you want people to think of you. It's the truth. When you hear them whispering \"kingslayer\" behind your back, doesn't it bother you? Of course it bothers me. A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness. I'm giving you half of our forces - You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts. I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life. He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us. And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect. So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

The future of our family will be determined in these next few months. We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years. Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did. I need you to become the man you were always meant to be. Not next year. Not tomorrow. Now. You're in pain. I've had worse, my lady. Perhaps it's time to go home. The South doesn't seem to agree with you. I know the truth Jon Arryn died for. Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles? Has he done this before? Jaime would have killed him. My brother is worth a thousand of your friend. Your brother or your lover? The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure. Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together. My son saw you with him. Do you love your children? - With all my heart. - No more than I love mine. - And they're all Jaime's. - Thank the gods. In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways. - In the morning, he doesn't remember. - You've always hated him. Hated him? I worshipped him. Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath. And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life. That night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine, and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, \"Lyanna.\" Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me. When the king returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth. You must be gone by then - you and your children. I will not have their blood on my hands. Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can. Because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you. And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself. Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell. He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up. All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself. Such a sad mistake. I've made many mistakes in my life but that wasn't one of them. Oh, but it was. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground. Come here. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh! Oh, yes! Oh! Oh! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh! No, no, no, no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you - wherever you're from - do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying? Yes, my lord. Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman. Well, go ahead. Slowly. You're not fooling them. They just paid you. They know what you are. They know it's all just an act. Your job is to make them forget what they know. Now, that takes time. You need to ease into it. Go ahead. Ease into it. He's winning you over in spite of yourself. You're starting to like this. He wants to believe you. He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you? He knows he's better than other men. He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof. He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature. Why don't you join us, my lord? I'm saving myself for another. What she doesn't know won't hurt her. A stupid saying. What we don't know is usually what gets us killed. She must be very beautiful. No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though. I do believe my lord's in love. For many years. Most of my life, really. Play with her arse. And she loved me too. I was her little confidant, her plaything. She could tell me anything, anything at all. She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle that she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry - a Northerner with a jaw like an anvil. So I challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories. The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories. In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me. \"He's just a boy,\" she said. \"Please don't hurt him.\" So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went. Is she still married to him? Oh, no. He got himself killed before the wedding and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen. She loves him, I'm afraid. And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? He's just so good. Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that I'll never win, not that way. That's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them. I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know. That's what I am. And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want. And what do you want? Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is. Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight. Hmm. You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that? Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals. Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes. The sea would come in closer and closer. You'd see death creeping towards you a few inches at a time. Where is it you come from? The Iron Islands. They far away? You've never heard of the Iron Islands? Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither. \"Trust me, my lord.\" You're not living in the wilderness anymore. In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles. - And what's that? - Lord. Why? What do you mean, why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands. What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too? - I will be lord after my father. - So you're not lord now? No, you Are you having a go at me? Is that it? I just don't understand how you southerners do things. - I'm not a southerner. - You're from south of the Wall. That makes you a southerner to me. You're an impudent little wench, aren't you? Couldn't say, my lord. Don't know what \"impunent\" means. Impudent. It means rude, disrespectful. Do you want to lose that chain? Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest. I thought she was our prisoner. Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience? Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens. I'm used to worse than him. Hmm? I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones. Why did you come here? Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further south than this. As far south as south goes, before the long night comes. Why? What are you afraid of? There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night. - Owls and shadowcats - I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats. The things you speak of - they've been gone for thousands of years. They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping. And they ain't sleeping no more. I miss girls. Not even talking to them. I never talked to them. Just looking at them, hearing them giggle. Don't you miss girls? Riders. The horn. We have to blow the horn. Why is he alone? One blast for a ranger returning, two for wildlings, - three for - There's no rider. Whoa, boy, whoa. That's my Uncle Benjen's horse. Where's my uncle? Ned! It's Robert. We were hunting a boar I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man. I was never meant to be a father. Go on. You don't want to see this. My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust. It stinks. It stinks like death. Don't think I can't smell it. I paid the bastard back, Ned. I drove my knife right through his brain. You ask 'em if I didn't. Ask 'em! I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw. And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me. Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned. - Robert, my sweet - Out, all of you! You damned fool. Paper and ink on the table. Write down what I say. \"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, \"first of\" You know how it goes. Fill in the damn titles. \"I hereby command \"Eddard of House Stark\" titles, titles \"to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm \"upon my death, \"to rule in my stead \"until my son Joffrey comes of age.\" Give it over. Give it to the council after I'm dead. At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing. You'll rule now. You'll hate it worse than I did but you'll do it well. The girl Daenerys. You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother worthless. No one to tell me \"no\" but you. Only you. Let her live. Stop it, if it's not too late. I will. And my son help him, Ned. Make him better than me. I'll I'll do everything I can to honor your memory. My memory. King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig. Give me something for the pain and let me die. Give him milk of the poppy. He was reeling from the wine. He commanded us to step aside, but I failed him. No man could have protected him from himself. I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine? His squire, from the king's own skin. His squire? The Lannister boy? Such a dutiful boy to make sure His Grace did not lack refreshment. I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself. His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen. Whatever arrangements you made unmake them. At once. I'm afraid those birds have flown. The girl is likely dead already. The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs. According to the prophecy the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth. The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water. The earth does not end at the sea there are many dirts beyond the sea. The dirt where I was born. Not dirts. Lands. Lands, yes There are thousands of ships in the free cities. Wooden horses that fly across the sea Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs. It's not a chair. It's a  throne. Throne. A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen. A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse. Can't you help me make him understand? The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you. My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. Have I said something funny, ser? Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the Kingdoms because they were his right. He had no right to them. He seized them because he could. And because he had dragons. Ah, well, having a few dragons makes things easier. - You don't believe it. - Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report. As for the rest it was 300 years ago. Who knows what really happened? Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant captain, see if he has any letters for me. - I'll come with you. - No, no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough. Psst! Jorah the Andal. The Spider sends his greetings and his congratulations. A royal pardon. You can go home now. Sweet reds I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor! Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours! I have them! I have them! A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady. One taste and you'll name your first child after me. My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine. Just a taste. My lady, you are from Westeros. You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Khaleesi of the Riding Men and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms. - Princess. - Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine. That? Dornish swill. Not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor - nectar of the gods. Let me give you a cask. A A gift. You honor me, ser. The honor the honor is all mine. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. You know, there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, Princess. I hope to repay your kindness someday. Rakharo. Put down that cask. - Is something wrong? - I have a thirst. Open it. The wine is for the khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you. Open it. Pour. It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich - without at least giving it time to breathe. - Do as he says. As the princess commands. Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, ser? Taste it, my lord. Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue. You first. Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage. Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares. You will drink. Stop him! Come. You came to us as outlaws poachers, rapers, killers, thieves. You came alone, in chains, without friends or honor. You came to us rich and you came to us poor. Some of you bear the names of proud Houses, others only bastard names or no names at all. It does not matter. All that is in the past. Here on the Wall we are all one House. - Tonight - You're allowed to look happy. You're going to be a ranger. Isn't that what you always wanted? I want to find my uncle. I know he's alive out there. I know he is. I wish I could help you, but I'm no ranger. It's the steward's life for me. There's honor in being a steward. Not much, really. But there's food. Here you begin anew. A man of the Night's Watch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king or a lord, or the honor of this House or that House, not for gold or glory, or a woman's love, but for the realm and all the people in it. You've all learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say them. The penalty for desertion is death. You can take your vows here tonight at sunset. Do any of you still keep the old gods? I do, my lord. You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did. Yes, my lord. You'll find a weirwood a mile north of the Wall. And your old gods too, maybe. My lord, might I go as well? Does House Tarly keep the old gods? No, my lord. I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him. Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House? The Night's Watch is my House now. The Seven have never answered my prayers. Perhaps the old gods will. As you wish, lad. You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths. Halder to the builders. Pyp to the stewards. Toad to the builders. Grenn to the rangers. Samwell to the stewards. Matthar to the rangers. Dareon to the stewards. Balian to the rangers. Rast to the rangers. Jon to the stewards. Rancer to the builder. Echiel to the builders. Gordo to the stewards. Niko to the rangers. Escan to the rangers. Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables. Mink to the kitchens. Allo to the builders. Nelugo to the rangers. May all the gods preserve you. Rangers with me. Builders! Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library. Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens. Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe in the stables. Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch. Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive. Make no comment about his nose. Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward. Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath? Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you. Do you take me for a servant? We took you for a man of the Night's Watch. But perhaps we were wrong in that. - May I go? - As you wish. Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing? I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. He wanted it and he got it. Stewards are nothing but maids! I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you! - It's not fair. - Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock. I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver. So now I'm here - at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you. I'll never see my family again. I'll never be inside a woman again. So don't tell me about fair. I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister. Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock? Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song. Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. You'll be with him day and night. Yes, you'll clean his clothes. But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle. You'll know everything, be part of everything. And he asked for you himself. He wants to groom you for command. I just I always wanted to be a ranger. I always wanted to be a wizard. What? No, I'm serious. So you'll stay and say your words with me? Lord Stark a moment. Alone, if you will. He named you Protector of the Realm. He did. She won't care. Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command. And what should I do with a hundred swords? Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps. We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody. Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom. Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us. What about Stannis? Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm. Stannis is your older brother. This isn't about the bloody line of succession. That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now. What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is. He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a king. I am. Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice. He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet. Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert. Tell me something. Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings? I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds. You will sail to Dragonstone tonight. You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon. Not his steward not his captain of the guard and not his wife. Only Stannis himself. Yes, my lord. Now leave us. My Lord Protector. The king has no trueborn sons. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.", "summary": ["Plot Lannister camp The Lannister army, poised to invade the Riverlands.  Explaining that the future of the Lannisters is at stake, Tywin presses Jaime to \"be the man you were meant to be\" as they prepare for battle. Ned confronts Cersei about the secrets that killed Jon Arryn. With the fate of the missing Benjen very much on his mind, Jon takes his Night's Watch vows, though not with the assignment he coveted. After Ser Jorah saves Daenerys from treachery, an enraged Drogo vows to lead the Dothraki where they've never gone before. An injured Robert takes pains to ensure an orderly transition at King's Landing.  Summary At the Lannister Camp On the borders of the Riverlands, Lord Tywin Lannister has assembled an army of sixty thousand men, with which he plans to oppose the Starks and punish Catelyn's capture of his son Tyrion Lannister.  Tywin and Jaime Tywin discusses the future of House Lannister with his son Jaime.  As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag, he tells his elder son, Jaime, that this conflict will decide the fate of their family; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist, as the Targaryens had done. He orders Jaime to become the man he was meant to be, and to take thirty thousand men and besiege Riverrun, Catelyn's childhood home and the seat of House Tully. Jaime ponders why Tywin would risk so much for the ugly, stunted son that he hates, but to Tywin a Lannister is a Lannister - even though he considers Tyrion the least worthy member of their family, any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak.  At Winterfell Theon and Osha Theon attempts to intimidate Osha.  In Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy attempts to bully Osha, the wildling woman captured in the recent raid. He insists that she refer to him as \"My Lord\", but she is unimpressed with his antics. She points out that he is not entitled to this, as his father is still alive. Maester Luwin dismisses Theon and questions Osha about why her band crossed the Wall and were fleeing \"as far south as south goes\". She claims that the White Walkers have awoken after a millennia asleep and are coming south, to Luwin's skepticism.  At the Wall Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly are standing watch atop the Wall when Benjen's horse is spotted returning, but, to Jon's horror, there is no sign of Benjen himself.  Later on, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont names the trainees as men of the Night's Watch. He hands out assignments, but to Jon's disgust he is being sent to the stewards, not the rangers. He will work directly for the Lord Commander as his personal steward. His attempts to plead his case to Maester Aemon (who has selected Samwell as his own steward) are met with indifference. However, Sam suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by Ser Alliser Thorne to punish Jon, it is also an opportunity for the Lord Commander to groom Jon directly for command. Both are surprised when Pypar admits that he was sent to the Watch for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord, not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed. Nothing about being sent to the Wall is fair.  Jon and Sam oaths Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly swear their oaths to the Night's Watch.  Convinced, Jon and other worshipers of the Old Gods of the Forest say their oath of fealty to the Night's Watch in front of a heart tree just inside the eaves of the Haunted Forest and are acknowledged as men of the Watch. Sam decided to take the oath with Jon, as the Seven gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him. After they take their oaths, Ghost finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to Jon and a horrified Sam.  At Vaes Dothrak Drogo and Dany Daenerys tries to convince Drogo to invade Westeros.  In Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys attempts to convince Khal Drogo about the benefits of an invasion of the Seven Kingdoms, but Drogo is reluctant to cross the Narrow Sea, despite the thousands of ships they could find in the Free Cities to do the job. He says that a man doesn't need an \"iron chair\" but only a horse. Daenerys travels to the marketplace with Ser Jorah Mormont and her handmaidens. She asks Jorah to help convince her husband since the Seven Kingdoms are hers by birthright, but he reminds her that her ancestor Aegon the Conqueror took six of the Seven Kingdoms because he was capable of doing so with dragons. A Little Bird gives Jorah a message from Varys, a royal pardon for his crimes; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy. Seeing Daenerys with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the Arbor, Jorah realizes that the wine has been poisoned; this is the assassination attempt. Having second thoughts, he steps in and stops Daenerys from drinking it. The wineseller attempts to flee, but Rakharo brings him down with a bolo tangling his ankles.  Wineseller captured The wine seller is captured after trying to poison Daenerys.  With the wine seller captured, Ser Jorah tells Daenerys that Robert Baratheon will never stop trying to kill her and her future children. Drogo quickly arrives in the tent. He glares at the seller and then goes to Daenerys to ensure she is okay, before offering Jorah the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination. Enraged, he begins to yell out in Dothraki that his army will cross the \"poison water\" as no khalasar has done before and take the Iron Throne for his son. Drogo's khalasar departs Vaes Dothrak the next morning, with the wine seller tied naked to the saddle of Daenerys' horse, forced to walk until he eventually falls of exhaustion and is dragged to his death.  In King's Landing Lord Eddard Stark meets with Cersei Lannister. He tells her that he knows the secret that Jon Arryn died for: that Cersei's three children are not Robert's, but the product of incest between her and Jaime. Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it, comparing their love to the old Targaryen practice of marrying brother to sister; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night, when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei's bed and called her \"Lyanna\". Eddard angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately. When Robert returns from his hunt, he will tell him the truth of the matter and Cersei should run as far as she can before that happens, lest Robert's wrath find her. Cersei icily calls Ned a fool for turning down the throne himself after the sack of King's Landing. Eddard tells her that he has regrets, but that isn't one of them. Cersei departs with a chilling warning: \"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.\"  Robert&#039;s last act Robert Baratheon signs a document confirming Eddard Stark as Protector of the Realm.  In one of his brothels, Littlefinger instructs the newly-arrived Ros and another prostitute, Armeca, on how to please their customers and make them happy. When they ask him to join them, he refuses, saying that he only ever had eyes for one woman. He tells them about his past, how he loved and fought a duel for a woman. He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means, as they would never let him compete on equal terms. When Ros asks him what he wants, he says, \"Oh, everything.\" Renly finds Eddard and tells him that Robert has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive. Eddard finds Robert telling Joffrey that he wishes he could have been a better father to him. Eddard chooses not to tell Robert about his discoveries to spare his final hours from pain. Robert instructs Eddard to make a letter naming him as the Lord Protector of the Realm, to rule until Joffrey comes of age. Eddard does not write Joffrey's name, instead saying \"the rightful heir\". Robert also asks him to cancel the attempt on Daenerys Targaryen's life.  Leaving the chamber, Eddard talks to Varys and Ser Barristan Selmy; by asking Selmy a seemingly-innocent question about the wine, Varys slyly points out that Lancel Lannister ensured the King kept \"refreshed\" with alcohol during the hunt, meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable. Varys also says it is far too late to stop the attempt on Daenerys' life.  Eddard&#039;s letter The letter Ned sends to Stannis Baratheon, informing him of his findings.  At King's Landing, Renly confronts Eddard and offers him a hundred swords to take Joffrey into custody, but Eddard refuses to dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in the Red Keep and taking frightened children hostage. Renly suggests that he could make a good king, but Eddard angrily points out that Stannis is Renly's older brother and the true heir. In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to Lord Stannis and instructs a courier to take the message to Dragonstone, Stannis's island fortress. Littlefinger then arrives and talks to Eddard, who tells him the truth about Joffrey's parentage. Littlefinger suggests that they keep quiet, acknowledge Joffrey as king and make him their puppet. If he proves intractable, they can reveal the truth and crown the more malleable Renly instead. Eddard considers this treason. Littlefinger realizes that even though Lord Eddard has Robert's edict naming him Regent and Protector of the Realm, he doesn't have the men he needs to seize control from Cersei. He needs the loyalty of the City Watch. Littlefinger understands that the honorable Eddard Stark can't come right out and ask him to bribe them, but agrees to do what needs to be done.  Cersei &amp; Joffrey 1x07 In King's Landing, Eddard is summoned to the throne room by \"King Joffrey\"; Robert has died. He arrives to find Littlefinger and Varys waiting for him, along with Commander Janos Slynt and a detachment of the City Watch. Varys tells him that Renly has fled the city, along with Ser Loras Tyrell and a number of retainers. They were last seen heading south. The party enters the throne room, where Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne. He demands oaths of fealty from his councilors and subjects. Instead, Eddard gives Ser Barristan Selmy the proclamation naming him as Lord Protector of the Realm. To Barristan's shock, Cersei takes the \"paper shield\" and tears it up. Instead, she suggests that Eddard bend the knee and swear allegiance.  Ned 1x07 Eddard Stark confronts King Joffrey in the throne room.  In return he will be allowed to return to Winterfell. Eddard responds that Joffrey has no claim to the Iron Throne and commands Slynt to take the Queen and her son into custody. Instead, the City Watch kill Eddard's bodyguards and Littlefinger holds a knife to his throat, saying, \"I did warn you not to trust me.\""], "review": null}, "7": {"id": "s01e08", "name": "The Pointy End", "script": "Yah!

Arya Stark, come with us. Your father wants to see you.

He'll reward you. - She'll reward me - the queen! Stay away! Lord Stark, you must be thirsty. Varys. I promise you it isn't poisoned. Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, my lord. I would save the rest, if I were you. Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells. What about my daughters? The younger one seems to have escaped the castle. Even my little birds cannot find her. - And Sansa? - Still engaged to Joffrey. Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though all dead, it grieves me to say. I do so hate the sight of blood. You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing. And would again, my lord. I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords. When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth? The madness of mercy. - That she might save her children. - Ah, the children. It's always the innocents who suffer. It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar. The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king. I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard? The queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother. The wrong brother, sadly. And lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers. If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it. Not today, my lord. Tell me something, Varys. Who do you truly serve? The realm, my lord. Someone must. It's Othor, without a doubt. The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off. Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party? Just these two, my lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say. - Mmm. - The smell. What smell? There is none. If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot? - We should burn them. - Snow's not wrong, my lord. Fire will do for them. The wildling way. I want Maester Aemon to examine them first. You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid. - Get them inside. - You heard him. Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers A raven from King's Landing. Come on, move 'em out. Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself. The king is dead. Is there any word of my father? Sit. Lord Stark has been charged with treason. They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey. I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid. Your duty lies here now. My sisters were in King's Landing too. I'm sure they'll be treated gently. Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear. King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne. He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't. Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake. Send for my father. He'll tell you - the king was his friend. Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that. Yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my son? A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king. She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch? No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see. I'll be a queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything. The girl is innocent, Your Grace. She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty. Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, - what's his name? - Robb. Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt. Best it comes from you. If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace. Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey. If If I could see my father, talk to him about You disappoint me, child. We have told you of your father's treason. Why would you want to speak to a traitor? I only meant that What will happen to him? - That depends. - On - On what? - On your brother. And on you. Treason? Sansa wrote this? It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words. You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king. Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed? This is a royal command, my lord. - If you should refuse to obey - I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing. But not alone. Call the banners. All of them, my lord? They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not? They have. Now we see what their words are worth. Yes. Are you afraid? I must be. Good. - Why is that good? - It means you're not stupid. You've had this since dawn? He sent it to me, not you. - I've only shown it to you as a courtesy. - A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner. - My son intends to declare war. - A war? Your son against the Lannisters? You should go to him. Teach him patience. Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law! Does family mean nothing to you? Family means everything to me. And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars. - I'm hungry. - Hush now, darling. You just ate. You will not support us, then? Do I understand you correctly? - But I'm hungry! - Soon, love, soon. You're always welcome here, sister. But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight That is what I ask. Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after. If you fear for the safety of your son Of course I fear for the safety of my son! Are you an idiot? They killed my husband. You say they shoved your boy from a window. - These people will do anything. - And that is why we have to stop them. The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord. Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here. If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart. I should just take your food and leave you here. Eh? - What would you do then? - Starve, most likely. You don't think I'd do it, do you? What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women? Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer. But you knew that. That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor. Fair enough. But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and \"my lord\" you every time you take a shit. I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend. Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder. And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price, I'll beat it. I like living. Tyrion. Tyrion. Come, share our fire. Help yourselves to our goat. When you meet your gods, you tell them Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you. I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister. How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin? In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock. Take the halfman. He can dance for the children. Kill the other one. No, no, no, no, no! My My house is rich and powerful. If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold. We have no use for a halfman's promises. Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies. What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by? Are those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back. Lannister smiths shit better steel. You think you can win us over with your trinkets? That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns. But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets. I will give you this. What is \"this\"? The Vale of Arryn. The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes. The lords of the Vale want me dead. I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale. Now there's a rare sight Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard. - Jon, no! - Jon, stop, put it down! Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard. I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go. Ghost, what's wrong? Is someone out there? Commander? Stay. Hello? Who's there? Lord Commander? Snow? Commander! Move! What did they do? Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel. I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money. Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros. Jorah, make them stop. - Khaleesi? - You heard me. These men have shed blood for their khal. Now they claim their rewards. She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue. Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been. I do not have a gentle heart, ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why. Come. - What do you want done with them? - Bring her to me. And those women there. You cannot claim them all, Princess. I can, and I will. Moon of my life, Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount. Tell me the truth of this. Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted. This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please. It pleases me to keep them safe. If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives. Does the horse mate with the lamb? The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike. You are a foreigner. You do not command me. I am Khaleesi. I do command you. See how fierce she grows? That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire. I will hear no more. Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock. A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal. I will not have your body burned. I will not give you that honor. The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs. The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones. First you have to kill me. I already have. My sun and stars is wounded. A scratch moon of my life. Where are the healers? This is the bite of a fly. I can help the great rider with his cut. The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep. She is mine. Let her speak. Thank you, silver lady. Who are you? I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I was the godswife of this temple. Witch. My mother was godswife here before me. She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments. All men are of one flock, so my people believe. The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears. Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester. Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy. I'm the man you want leading the vanguard. Galbart Glover will lead the van. The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover. I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home. You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber. And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker. Oathbreaker, is it?! I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass. My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord. But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me. Your meat is bloody tough. - What is it? What's happened? - Shh, it's all right. - Where are you going? - South. For Father. - But it's the middle of the night. - The Lannisters have spies everywhere. I don't want them to know we're coming. - They have more men than we do. - Aye, they do. Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding. And I won't get in the way, I There must always be a Stark at Winterfell. Until I return that will be you. You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand? Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother. - I will. - I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared. Until I return. How long have you been hiding out there? Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye. - They've all gone away. - They'll be back soon. Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother. No, they won't. Please watch over Robb. And watch over all the other men from Winterfell. And Theon too, I suppose. You hear them, boy? The old gods are answering you. - What are you doing here? - They're my gods too. Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods. - Even slaves are allowed to pray. - You're not a slave. Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat. I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths. What did you mean about hearing the gods? You asked them, they're answering you. Shh. Open your ears. It's only the wind. Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods? They see you, boy. They hear you. Your brother will get no help from them where he's going. The old gods have no power in the South. The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago. How can they watch when they have no eyes? Well, there's a big man. He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen. Go back and find your clothes, Hodor. - Go dress. - Hodor. Are there really giants beyond the wall? Giants and worse than giants. I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way. All these swords, they should be going north, boy. North, not south! The cold winds are rising. They were touched by white walkers. That's why they came back. That's why their eyes turned blue. Only fire will stop them. - How do you know that? - I read about it in a book a very old book in Maester Aemon's library. - What else did the book say? - The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years. And when they wake up And when they wake up, what? I hope the Wall's high enough. Summer snows, my lady. Robb's brought the North with him. The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels. And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South. Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's. One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large. Mother! You look well. Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times. We had thought not to meet you here, my lady. I had not thought to be here. I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, my lords. You heard her! Move your arses! Come on, out. You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf? Have no fear, my lady. We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned. - You old devil, Rodrik. - Jon. You're not wasting away, are you? I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling. And now I find you leading a host to war. - There was no one else. - No one? Who were those men I saw here? - None of them are Starks. - All of them are seasoned in battle. If you think you can send me back to Winterfell Oh, would that I could. There was a letter. From Sansa. From the queen, you mean. - There's no mention of Arya. - No. How many men do you have?", "summary": ["Plot In the aftermath of Ned's capture, Syrio and Arya face off against Lannister guards while Cersei manipulates Sansa to her own ends. Robb rallies his father's northern allies against Tywin Lannister and heads south to war. Tyrion forms an uneasy alliance with the hill tribes and reunites with his father. Jon lashes out at Thorne and battles a mysterious attacker from beyond the Wall. Dany is forced to reconcile her desire to conquer Westeros with Drogo's savagery after the Dothraki raid a peaceful village.  Summary At the Wall Jon and Sam return to Castle Black with their party and two dead bodies in tow. The two corpses are identified as members of Benjen Stark's missing ranging party, Jafer Flowers and Othor. Though the deceased appear to have been dead for some time, Sam astutely notes that the bodies do not smell like they have been rotting. Jon and several other Sworn Brothers urge Lord Commander Jeor Mormont to burn the bodies, but he refuses, wanting Maester Aemon to examine them.  Jon is summoned to Mormont's chambers as news has arrived of Eddard's arrest and imprisonment. When Jon asks for news of his father, Mormont tells Jon he has been arrested for treason. Jon is in disbelief and Mormont gives Jon the letter to read for himself. A devastated Jon attempts to leave before Mormont tells him not to do anything stupid and reminds him of the oath he has sworn to the Night's Watch. When Jon expresses concern for his sisters, Mormont replies he is sure they are unharmed.  Later on, Alliser Thorne taunts Jon that his father is a traitor, calling him, \"not just a bastard, a traitor's bastard.\" Jon angrily charges at him with a knife and Thorne is only saved by Grenn and Pyp, who hold Jon back. Commander Mormont witnessed the incident and confines Jon to quarters for his trouble. That night, Jon is roused by a whining Ghost scratching at the door. Sensing trouble, Jon and his direwolf head to the Lord Commander's chambers where Jon is confronted by a wight, the reanimated corpse of the dead Night's Watchman. Though Jon is able to stab the wight through the chest with his sword, the wight simply removes the sword and is unharmed. Mormont appears, seeking out the commotion. Jon grabs Mormont's oil lamp and throws it at the wight, finally destroying it.  The morning after, the two wight bodies have been thoroughly burned. Sam says he read in a book that the dead are animated by the touch of the White Walkers and only fire can destroy such creatures. He hopes the Wall is big enough to hold them back when the Walkers come in force.  At the Eyrie At the Eyrie, Catelyn is furious with Lysa: first for Lysa not immediately notifying her about Eddard's arrest and second, for refusing to consider summoning the knights of the Vale to war. Lysa, despite her actions of setting this in motion by implicating the Lannisters in Jon Arryn's death, does not believe that war is in the Vale's best interests. Lysa wants the knights to stay in the Vale to protect her son and their Lord.  In the Mountains of the Moon Tyrion and Bronn have reached the western edge of the Vale and are surrounded by members of the hill tribes, led by a fearsome warrior named Shagga. At first, he orders them to be killed, but Tyrion does some fast-talking and convinces the hill tribes that House Lannister is an enemy of the House Arryn and its rulers. He proposes an alliance which will allow the tribes to enact vengeance against House Arryn and take ownership of the lands of the Vale. They eagerly agree, and escort Tyrion and Bronn westwards towards where the Lannister armies are gathering.  In the North Winterfell ravens Dozens of ravens leaving Winterfell, summoning the banners of the North to war.  Robb receives a letter from Sansa in King's Landing, asking him to pledge fealty to King Joffrey. Maester Luwin correctly deduces the letter is actually the work of the Queen. Robb refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens, summoning the lords bannermen of the North and their armies to assemble at Winterfell. Released ravens fill the sky.  At Winterfell, Robb holds a feast for several of his newly-arrived bannermen. Jon Umber assumes that he will lead the vanguard, and is offended by the suggestion that he would be made to march behind a Glover, threatening to withdraw from the host. In response, Robb promises that, after the conflict with the Lannisters, he will oust Greatjon from his keep and hang him for breaking his oaths to House Stark; when the enraged bannerman goes to draw a weapon, Robb's direwolf Grey Wind sets upon him, biting off two of his fingers. Robb recites 'that it [is] death to bear steel against your liege lord' but then diffuses the situation by excusing Greatjon's aggression, saying that 'doubtless, the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me'. The Greatjon roars with laughter and accepts Robb's commands, much to the shock of Bran, who witnessed the entire incident. Robb says farewell to Bran and to Rickon, who is convinced he'll see neither Robb nor his parents again.  Bran prays by the heart tree when he is approached by Osha who tells him the Old Gods of the Forest are listening to him and that the wildlings also worship the Old Gods. She laments that the South has lost touch with the past; the southern Weirwoods were cut down years ago and the Southerners have no idea what's awakening in the north. They are interrupted by Hodor who was bathing and has forgotten to put his clothes back on, and Osha remarks that he might have giant blood in him before Bran sends him away. Curious, Bran asks her if giants live beyond the wall. She affirms they do, as well has many other beings, though not all of them are friendly. She asserts that the army Robb has gathered should be marching north, not south.  Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel intercept Robb's army in the Neck as it presses southwards. Robb initially exclaims with excitement upon seeing his mother, but stops short of embracing her lest he look weak in front of his bannermen. Catelyn looks at her son with understanding, later embracing once their liege-lords have left their tent. She tells Robb he has no choice but to go to war. However, he cannot lose, for the sake of Ned, Sansa, and Arya, as if he is defeated, Tywin Lannister will show their family no mercy.  Later on, Robb and his lords are debating on the route of their march, and on whether to march directly against Tywin's army or against Jaime's army besieging Riverrun. To get to Jaime, they need to cross the Green Fork of the River Trident, and the only crossing is at the Twins, held by the notoriously prickly and easily-offended Lord Walder Frey. A Lannister scout is captured, and Robb sends him back to warn Lord Tywin that twenty thousand Northern soldiers are marching against him.  At the Lannister Camp Kevan and Tywin Kevan and Tywin Lannister greet Tyrion and his companions.  Tyrion, Bronn, Shagga and the rest of the hill tribesmen arrive at the Lannister encampment, to find Lord Tywin Lannister and his brother, Ser Kevan, planning to engage the Stark army, which is moving south from the Neck. Tywin shows no sign of relief that his son is alive. Tywin accepts the aid of the hill tribesmen, but Shagga will only fight if Tyrion fights alongside them, a prospect which Tywin welcomes and terrifies Tyrion. In Lhazar Drogo 1x08 Khal Drogo disciplines Mago.  In Essos, Khal Drogo having taken an oath to take the Iron Throne, has begun his march of conquest to the Narrow Sea. The Dothraki raid a village in Lhazar, a peaceful country to the south-east of Vaes Dothrak. To finance the war to come, they must raid villages and take people to sell into slavery, thereby gaining the money to hire ships for the khalasar to assault Westeros. Ser Jorah and others try to explain this to Daenerys, but she is disturbed to see the aftermath, the Dothraki killing the villagers and raping their women, and orders it stopped. The Dothraki grow angry at not being able to take the spoils of victory, as that is the Dothraki way. She starts claiming all the women they see to protect them. The angry warriors take their complaints to Khal Drogo, but he is amused at his wife's fierceness. He tells them that Daenerys may keep the women she has claimed, they can find others. One man won't listen, and angrily accuses Drogo of being slave to a foreign whore.  Daenerys 1x08 Daenerys notes Drogo's injury.  Khal Drogo stops the complaints by killing Mago, the offended warrior who challenges him. Drogo takes a deep wound to the chest in the process. Though Drogo dismisses it as a scratch, Daenerys insists it be treated and allows one of the women she rescued, a healer called Mirri Maz Duur to treat the wound, despite the distaste of Drogo's bloodriders, who derisively call the woman maegi (a witch). In King's Landing Lannister soldiers complete their purge of the Stark guards and household staff. Sansa and Septa Mordane hear sounds of fighting. When they are confronted by Lannister guardsmen led by Sandor Clegane, Septa Mordane tells Sansa to run and lock herself in her room while she stays to confront them. However, Sandor later finds and takes Sansa into custody. More Lannister guardsmen, this time led by Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard, interrupt a \"dancing\" lesson between Syrio Forel and Arya. Syrio holds Arya back, questioning why Lord Eddard would send Lannister men to find Arya. She then refuses to go with them, and when they try to force the issue Syrio disarms and disables all of the lightly-armored guardsmen with his wooden practice sword. He tells Arya to run as he faces down Trant, noting that for himself, \"the First Sword of Braavos does not run.\" Syrio's fate after this is unclear.  Syrio&#039;s last stand Syrio Forel confronts Ser Meryn Trant and Lannister guards.  Arya runs to the stables where the men waiting with their baggage were supposed to be to take them to the ship for Winterfell. The men are dead, but she finds her real sword, Needle, in the bottom of her trunk. Arya then starts to leave the stables. (Arya knows how to get out of the Red Keep via the tunnel under the castle that she found when she was chasing cats and followed the two conspirators). When a stableboy tries to grab her, Arya turns around brandishing Needle and accidentally runs him through and kills him. Horrified, she flees.  Varys visits Eddard Stark in his cell in the dungeons. He is incredulous that Eddard warned Cersei what he was going to do. Eddard says he wanted to extend mercy to Cersei's children, whom Robert would have killed if he'd known the truth. Varys bluntly tells Eddard that his mercy is what killed King Robert, to Eddard's shame. Varys then tells him that Catelyn also no longer holds Tyrion as her prisoner, meaning that the Starks have nothing to barter with for Eddard's life. When Eddard suggests they should just kill him, Varys says \"Not today, my lord.\" As he departs, Eddard asks Varys who he truly serves: Varys, in a rare display of honesty, replies \"The realm, my lord. Someone must.\"  Cersei and the remainder of the small council, comprising Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys, and Littlefinger, summon Sansa to inform her that her father has been arrested for treason. They manipulate Sansa into writing a letter to her brother Robb, asking him to bend the knee peacefully to Joffrey. They add that Eddard's fate may depend on what his son and the other Northern lords do. Sansa agrees to write the letter.   Later on, King Joffrey holds court in the Red Keep. Janos Slynt, commander of the City Watch, is to be made Lord of Harrenhal as a reward for his loyal service. Cersei then dismisses Ser Barristan Selmy as head of the Kingsguard, noting that the time has come for an honorable retirement. Selmy is confused, pointing out that Kingsguard serve for life, but Joffrey angrily says that Selmy is too old, and wasn't able to protect his father, King Robert Baratheon. Selmy's disgrace is only compounded when he learns his post as Lord Commander is to be given to Jaime Lannister, much to his disgust. Varys announces that Selmy is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service, but the old knight, insulted by what he sees as being offered \"a hall to die in and men to bury me,\" takes off his armor, throws his sword at Joffrey's feet and storms out, stating that he could still kill all five of the other Kingsguard present with ease.  Sansa begs Joffrey for her father's life, claiming that the medicine he was taking for his injured leg was responsible for his treasonous talk. Joffrey says that her sweet words have moved him and he will spare Eddard, if he bends the knee to him and acknowledges him as king. Sansa says he will."], "review": null}, "8": {"id": "s01e09", "name": "Baelor", "script": "You've seen better days, my lord. Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.

Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat. My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me. l agree. - l'll go. - You can't! l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me. Unless there was a profit in it. What do you want? lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord. Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you? Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you? - Father, please - l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly. All right, you come forward. There. Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths. ls there somewhere we can talk? We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you! - Oh! - You too. You see that? Fifteen, she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine. l'm sure she will give you many sons. Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding. He is quite ill, my lord. Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me. - My lord, l - Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine. - l'm sure there were reasons - l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here? To ask you to open your gates, my lord so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way. - Why should l let him? - lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm. You swore an oath to my father. Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters. - Why don't you? - Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you? Andengage! When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand? - Soon, he says. - Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think. This is Valyrian steel. lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros. - My lord, you honor me, but l can't - Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me. So you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. - ls that understood? - Yes, my lord. Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it. l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight. No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist l've, uh, ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper. Yes, my lord. - Well done. - Well done. You earned that, Snow. Well done. Go on, let's have a look. - At what? - The sword! Show us the sword. Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! - Let's have a look. - Piss off. Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here! What is it? - l - Look at its eyes. - Give it. - l can't. You can't what? l l'm really not supposed to say. And yet you really want to say. You want to say that? There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb. What? What about him? He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe. l should be there. l should be with him. lf we do that, they'll never get back across. Well? What did he say? Lord Walder has granted your crossing. - His men are yours, as well. - Huh. Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you. What does he want in return? You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. - He expects a knighthood in good time. - Fine, fine. And? And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age. - She won't be happy about that. - Hm. And? And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will besuitable. l see. Did you get a look at his daughters? l did. And? One was Do you consent? - Can l refuse? - Not if you want to cross. Then l consent. Sam said you wanted to see me? l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children? No. So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do? He He would do whatever was right. No matter what. Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile? Sam told you. We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose. And this is my day? ls that what you're saying? Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. - l know. - You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother. The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children. Who are you? My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King. You're Aemon Targaryen. l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell youto stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have. My lord My sun and stars Drogo. My horse Blood of my blood No, l must ride. He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal. He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here. This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi. We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it. You do not command me, Khaleesi. Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me. The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi. Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me. Hyah! Hyah! Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north. The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless - provincial courage. - Ah. Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt. l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them. The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided. Shagga likes axes. When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard. - The vanguard? - Mm-hm. Me and the tribesmen on the front lines? They do seem rather ferocious. Ferocious? Last nighta Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay. When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander. Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort. There'll be no more discussion on the matter. lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords. Where did you find one so pretty at this hour? - l took her. - Took her? - From whom? - From, uh Ser What's his name? - l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down. - And he didn't have anything to say about it? He said something. Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow. Oh, well. l, uh think l'll go and find myself one. Who are you? Who would you like me to be? What did your mother call you? Shae. What did your mother call you? My mother died giving birth to me. ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers? - What sort of accent is that? - Foreign. For What do you want from me? What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be. And what do l get? One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular. Who told you this? Women you paid? And three more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal? Let's start with your last night in this world. Khaleesi. Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is. - He will die tonight, Khaleesi. - He can't. He can't. l won't let him. Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai. - l won't leave him. - He's already gone, Khaleesi. Doth Even if Even if he dies why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo. This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs. l won'tleave him. The wound has festered. You did this, witch. Stop it! l don't want her hurt. No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal. Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi. Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing. l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon. The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi. l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser. l think you're right. - You've saved me once more. - And now you must save him. He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path. Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some Some magic. There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner. Do it. Save him. - There is a price. - You'll have gold, whatever you want. lt's not a matter of gold. This is bloodmagic. Only death pays for life. My death? No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse. Khaleesi, do not do this thing. - Let me kill this witch. - Kill her and you kill your khal. This is bloodmagic. lt is forbidden. l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden. Go. Now. - Take her and leave. - Uh-uh. Take her! You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight. No one will enter. Bring him back to me. What have you done? l have to save him. We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe. This must not be. This must be. Witch. No, you can't. Khaleesi! No further, horselord. Are you hurt? - The baby - Hmm? ..is coming. - Fetch the midwives. - They will not come. They say she is cursed. They'll come or l'll have their heads. The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so. Are you in agony, my lion? - No. - You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin. Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain? - Just used to it. - Drink. Let's play a new game. There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you. Does it involve the potential for losing fingers? - Not if you win. - No! No fire games, no knife games. - Let's do something l'm good at. - What are you good at? l happen to be a great judge of character. - This sounds like a boring game. - lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying. l don't want to play this game. Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you. But my mother hit harder. You killed your first man before you were 12. lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me. You've been north of the Wall. What brought you up there? - Work. - And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty. l don't want to play. lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore. Drink. All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return. Drink. - And we've established the rules about lying? - Drink! Mm. You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere. The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one. So, specifics You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. Sowhat's a lowborn girl to do? Drink. - Are you sure - Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head. My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize. My turn. Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me. - Who were you in love with? - That's not how the game works. l don't care the way the game works. Our lord here used to be married. - Married? - How did you hear that? You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers. Another night, perhaps. Not another night. This night. lt's not a pleasant story. Oh, maybe l will cry. l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship. So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed. For three chickens, l should hope so. lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father. Well, l imagine that was the end of all that. Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapersall of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor. l would have killed the man who did that to me. You should have known she was a whore. Really? l was 16, drunk and in love. A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later. As l said, l was young and stupid. You are still young and stupid. Hyah! - What is it? What do you want? - You're sleeping through the war. - What? - They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north. - Get my squire! - You don't have a squire. lf l die, weep for me. You'll be dead. How will you know? l'll know. Watch out! Move! Out of the way! Move aside! Stay low. Stay low? lf you're lucky, no one will notice you. l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! - Moon Brothers! - And Painted Dogs! - And Painted Dogs! - Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! To battle! You're a shit warrior. l'm alive? You're alive. Did we win? We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't. How did our tribesmen do? Yeah, good. lt's nice to see them getting along. You're wounded. Good of you to notice. l hear we won. Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20. Did we get the Stark boy, at least? He wasn't here. Where was he? With his other 18,000 men. And where are they? - We should go, my lady. - No! My lady! Hyah! Hyah! By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened. Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it. lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband. l've lost them too, l'm afraid. Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. - He cut down ten of our men. You saw him. - He's more use to us alive than dead. Take him away and put him in irons. We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now. lf we do it your way, Kingslayer you'd win. We're not doing it your way. Come on, pretty man. - l sent 2,000 men to their graves today. - The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice. Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over. Could l have one? A lemon oneor any of them. Three coppers. - How about a nice fat pigeon? - Oh, piss off now. Go on. Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones? Piss off! Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening? - They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor. - Who? The Hand of the King. - Traitor! - Coward! Baelor. Baelor! Traitor! Traitor!", "summary": ["Plot With Sansa's life in danger, Ned makes a fateful decision. Catelyn brokers an unsavory deal with the slippery Walder Frey. Tyrion acquires a mistress and is forced by his father to fight on the front lines. Robb wins his first major victory and captures a prized prisoner. Jon is rewarded for his valor and discovers a dark secret about Maester Aemon. As Drogo's wound festers, Dany defies Qotho and puts her trust in the enslaved witch Mirri Maz Duur.  Summary In the Riverlands Theon and Robb 1x09 Theon and Robb outside the Twins.  Robb's army has reached the Twins, the heavily fortified crossing over the Green Fork of Trident River. Theon Greyjoy shoots down messenger ravens, so no word of their presence can be relayed, but finds nothing more but messages to extended family members. To enter the castle would be perilous for Robb, so Catelyn Stark enters to negotiate their crossing the river. Though held by House Frey, bannermen to Catelyn Stark's father, Lord Walder Frey has not yet taken up arms. When called up, he says he had been preparing to march, and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive. In reality, he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved. Now, as the Tully's army has been defeated and Riverrun is held by the Lannisters, he wants to know why he should be helping Robb and taking up arms against the king. After some hard bargaining between Catelyn and Walder, they strike a deal: the Freys will join Robb's cause, allow him to cross and commit troops to his army, but in return both Robb and Arya must each marry one of Walder's own children. Robb agrees, though noting that Arya won't like it. Robb must also take Olyvar Frey as a squire.  The Lannister armies prepare for battle. Tywin tells his son Tyrion that he means to use the hill tribe forces to give them an edge against the Stark army, essentially to be used as cannon fodder. He orders Tyrion to lead them from the front of the vanguard. Tyrion angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him. He storms back to his tent to find that Bronn has found him, as per instruction, a whore named Shae. Tyrion takes an immediate liking to her. When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning, Bronn goes off to find a whore for himself.  Tyrion, Bronn, and Shae play a drinking game the night before the battle. Tyrion makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink. He guesses correctly that Bronn has been beyond the Wall and killed someone before he was twelve years old (though it was a woman, not a man, and he killed her in self-defense, because she was coming at him with an axe). Tyrion guesses that Shae's mother was a whore, her father deserted them, and she is low born; however he is wrong on each guess. Tyrion cannot read Shae's personality, but this only makes her more intriguing to him. When Shae starts to question Tyrion, Bronn reveals that he heard Tyrion was once married. Reluctantly, Tyrion explains that when he was very young, he and Jaime were out riding near Casterly Rock and found a young common girl in distress from bandits. While Jaime chased the bandits off, Tyrion comforted the girl, whose name was Tysha. They ended up getting drunk at a local inn, and she became so enamored of him that Tyrion felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf. Later that night she had sex with Tyrion, the first time he was ever with a woman. Tyrion fell madly in love, and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret.  However, two weeks later his father, Tywin, found out, and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner. Tywin forced Jaime to reveal the truth: the girl was a prostitute. Jaime set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother. Tywin then instructed his guards to have sex with her, with her being paid a silver coin for each man, while Tyrion was forced to watch. Shae points out that Tyrion was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped. As she gets romantic with Tyrion, Bronn leaves the tent. Tyrion 1x09 Tyrion Lannister leads the hill tribes into battle.  The next morning the Lannister army finds that the Starks have stolen a march on them; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle. Tyrion gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen, but as they charge for the front he is first nearly trampled and then knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone's club. When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon, Bronn tells him that the Lannisters won the battle, but it was a feint. As a diversion, Robb sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay Tywin's forces, while the main army marched on Riverrun to attack Jaime's army. Jaime captured Jaime is captured by Robb's army.  Robb Stark after the battle Robb Stark after his victory.  Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle. Suddenly Robb returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner: Ser Jaime himself. The Battle of the Whispering Wood has lifted the siege of Riverrun, and Jaime's army has been destroyed. Jaime suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and Robb, but Robb refuses and has him imprisoned. Robb laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths. He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory, but the war is far from over.  At the Wall Jon and Jeor Jeor Mormont gives his sword Longclaw to Jon Snow.  At Castle Black, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont gives Jon Snow a Valyrian steel sword, Longclaw, in thanks for saving his life. Mormont also reinstates Jon to his former position and tells him he has dispatched Ser Alliser Thorne to King's Landing to lay the hand of the wight they found at the feet of the King and ask for aid. Aemon 1x09 Maester Aemon reveals his true identity.  Mormont explains to Jon that Longclaw was meant for his own son, Ser Jorah Mormont, but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to Essos. Jon goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword, but Samwell Tarly seems distant from the revelry. Sam takes Jon aside and informs him about Robb leading an army south to war. Jon ponders that he should be with him, but Maester Aemon tells him their duty to the Night's Watch comes first. To Jon's surprise, Aemon reveals that his full name is Aemon Targaryen, the son of a king, brother to another, the uncle of the Mad King. Already old and blind at the time, Aemon had to stand aside and do nothing, trembling with rage as he recounts that even his nephew's grandchildren were butchered during Robert's Rebellion. It is not an easy life they have chosen. Aemon remarks that he cannot make Jon stay or go. Like the Maester, Jon must make the choice himself and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life.  In Lhazar Drogo&#039;s fall Drogo after his fall.  Far to the east, Daenerys Targaryen is concerned that the wound her husband Khal Drogo took fighting Mago has festered and become infected. He falls from his horse, a grave sign of weakness amongst the Dothraki. Daenerys tells the khalasar that they are stopping and orders Qotho to get Mirri Maz Duur to help Drogo. Qotho is unhappy with entrusting Drogo's care to the woman, whom he calls a maegi or witch, but relents. At Daenerys' request, Ser Jorah armors himself. Jorah also advises her to leave now, because Drogo is certain to die and when he dies, his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill Daenerys's son, rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival, but Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband. Mirri Maz Duur promises to save Drogo's life, but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange. She takes Drogo's horse into his tent and starts the ceremony, slitting the animal's throat over Drogo's comatose form. As the crowd stands outside, loud growls are heard as a supernatural ritual begins.  Daenerys Jorah Mormont helps Daenerys.  Some of Drogo's warriors become enraged at what they see as Daenerys' attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and Qotho tries to attack her, but Ser Jorah kills him. Daenerys starts to go into labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives will help her, thinking she is cursed. With no choice, Jorah takes Daenerys into the tent as the ceremony continues.  In King's Landing Varys visits Eddard Stark in the dungeons under the Red Keep. Varys tells Eddard that Sansa begged for his life before the whole court and that Robb is leading an army from the North. In addition, the Queen is more concerned over the intentions of King Robert's brother, Stannis, a proven battle commander known to be without mercy. For the sake of Sansa's life, Varys urges Eddard to confess to treason. In return, Cersei will let him take the black and join his younger brother Benjen and bastard son Jon Snow on the Wall. Eddard is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life, though he appears to have second thoughts when Varys insinuates that Sansa would pay the price for his defiance.  Arya Stark is living rough on the streets of the city. She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread, to no avail. She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the Hand of the King is being brought before the Great Sept of Baelor, the center of religious worship in the city. Stunned that she will see her father, she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd. Unable to see, she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of Baelor (a previous Targaryen king, Baelor the Blessed, for whom the Sept is named). She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple. He sees Arya on the statue, and as he is dragged through the crowd he passes Yoren of the Night's Watch (who had met Arya). Lord Eddard looks at the statue and says, \"Baelor,\" puzzling the crowd. Yoren understands, however, and moves toward the statue where Arya is watching.  Eddard is given a chance to confess his \"crimes.\" He weighs his choices as he sees both Arya and Sansa present, and chooses to save them by making a false confession. He says that Joffrey is the true King on the Iron Throne, pleasing him. Grand Maester Pycelle extols the virtues of mercy and Joffrey agrees that he could be merciful and send Eddard to the Night's Watch as his mother has suggested and as Sansa has begged. He instead acknowledges that as women they are \"soft\" and treason must never go unpunished. He commands Ser Ilyn Payne to bring him the traitor's head.  Ned&#039;s execution Ser Ilyn Payne executes Eddard Stark.  The crowd goes into an uproar. Arya tries to make her way through the crowd, drawing her sword to save her father, but Yoren grabs and stops her, shielding her from seeing her father's death. Sansa screams and is restrained by guards as she faints. A visibly horrified Cersei frantically tries to persuade her son to reconsider, as does Varys, but there is no time. Forced to kneel, Eddard looks at the statue and sees that Arya has been rescued by Yoren, and is relieved in his eyes that she is safe. Ser Ilyn draws Eddard's own sword, Ice, and cuts his head off with a single blow. A flock of pigeons takes flight immediately afterwards, the sight being all Arya needs to know her father is dead."], "review": null}, "9": {"id": "s01e10", "name": "Fire and Blood", "script": "Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut. - Keep your mouth shut, boy. - l'm not a boy! You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north. lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there. Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet. - You're afraid. Just like Hodor. - l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground. You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go. That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father. You see? He's not here. Here, Shaggydog. Rickon! That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels! - He doesn't like chains. - What are you doing down here? - Come back up with us. - No, l came to see Father. How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya. He was down here. l saw him. Saw him when? Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog. You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that Bran - My lady. - My lady. My lady. - My lady. - My lady. My lady. Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword. Shh! Shh! - Shh! - l'll kill them all. - Every one of them. - Shh. l will kill them all. My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.

Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern. l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear. Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue? Your Grace? Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat. Every man needs hands, Your Grace. Good. - Tongue it is. - Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace. Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence? l beg you! Please, no. No! Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! - l'm done for the day. - No! l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother. Your Grace, please! You look quite nice. - Thank you, my lord. - \"Your Grace.\" l'm King now. Stop! No! Walk with me. l want to show you something. Do as you're bid, child. ..and as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long. No! Please, no! This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors. - You promised to be merciful. - l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him. Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay hereand obey. Look at him! Well? How long do l have to look? As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest? lf it please Your Grace. That's your Septa there. l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well. Or maybe he'll give me yours. My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn. Here, girl. Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court. Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants. You'll be needing that again. The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his. Renly is not the king. You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death. That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis. Do you mean to declare us for Stannis? - Renly is not right! - My lords. - lf we put ourselves behind Stannis - My lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North! l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North! Am l your brother, now and always? Now and always. My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day. The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! - Lady Stark. - l want to see him. Now! Leave us. You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman. l will kill you tonight, ser pack your head in a box and send it to your sister. Let me show you how Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look. lt shouldn't take long. That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death. But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it? Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, - if the gods are just. - What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice? Because of men like you. There are no men like me. Only me. My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower? l pushed him out the window. Why? lhoped the fall would kill him. Why? You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? - What's our next move? - Stop talking. Get back into bed. They have my son. The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped. l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses. ls it true about Stannis and Renly? Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace. There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning - in case you hadn't noticed. - l'm told we still have his sisters. The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime. No truces. We can't afford to look weak. We should march on them at once. First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now Madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong. Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but Unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here. No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing. - And do what? - Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest - - Baelish, Varys, Pycelle - Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me? You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand? Ser Jorah? Gently, gently. My son Where is he? l want him. Where is he? The boy did not live. - Tell me. - What is there to tell? How did my son die? He never lived, my princess. The women say What do the women say? - They say the child was - Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. lnsidehe was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price. Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life. As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him. - Time enough for that later - l want to see him now. The khalasar is gone. A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess. Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone? He seems to like the warmth, Princess. He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life. This is not life. When will he be as he was? When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. Leave us. l don't want you alone with this sorceress. l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go. You knew what l was buying and you knew the price. lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. - lt angered the Great Shepherd. - This is not God's work. - My child was innocent. - lnnocent? He would have been the stallion who mounts the world. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust. l spoke for you. - l saved you. - Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of feverjust three moons past. Sotell me again exactly what it was that you saved? Your life. Why don't you take a look at your khal Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone. You can't! Get out of my way, Sam. They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters? Better than you do. What are you going to do? l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. You can't leave us now. We need you here. - Move. - l won't let you go. - Move. - No. Hyah! Hand of the King? So it would seem. And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing? No, he said l couldn't take you with me to King's Landing. - He was very specific on that point. - He knew my name? What? He said, \"Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing\"? l believe he used the word \"whore\". Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out? l'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore. My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the king needs a Hand and the Hand l know what a Hand needs. Ghost? Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Samwell! - ls he dead? - No, he's not dead. Did we get him? Come on, help me get him up. Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong. - l belong with my brother. - But we're your brothers now. They'll kill you if they find out you've gone. They'll kill you if they know you came after me. - Go back. - Sam told us everything. - We're sorry about your father. - But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave. - l have to. - You can't. - You said the words. - l don't care about \"Hear my words and bear witness to my vow\" - To hell with all of you. - \"Night gathers and now my watch begins. \"lt shall not end until my death. \"l shall live and die at my post.\" \"l am the sword in the darkness\" \"The watcher on the walls\" \"The shield that guards the realms of men. \"l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, \"for this night and all nights to come.\" Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars. When the sun rises in the west ..and sets in the east ..then you shall return to me, my sun and stars. Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes. And keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes consumed by dreams of fire and blood Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal - powerful man, great warrior - but alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey may the gods bless his reign. He is a capable young man - strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king. Mmm. True greatness. So what's the thing? What thing? About kings. You said, \"The thing you need to understand about kings\" What? Things? What? When you started, you Never mind. Let me see you out, my dear. - lt's all right. No need. - Yes, yes. Till the next time. Right. When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years? lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads. A man with great ambition and no morals - l wouldn't bet against you. And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there? l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King. You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man. Oh, you can do better than that. When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? - l've always wondered. - Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs? l picturea gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right? l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all. Must be strange for you, even after all these years a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash? But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you. And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men - and women. - A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree. So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect. Playing our roles. Serving a new king. Long may he reign. - My king. - My king. My lords. Shall we begin? You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, cos nobody gives three shits. What's your name? Arry. You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time - men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot - half of them would turn you over to the king quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself - and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three. Watch yourself, midget. He's got a sword, this one. What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword? - Maybe he's a little squire. - He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword. Let's have a look. l could use me a sword like that. - Take it off him. - Give it here, midget. Look at him. You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death. l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. - You better give me that sword! - You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys. Like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it? - lt was a gift. - lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen murderers. - Which are you? - Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am. Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall! And winter is coming! Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring? Don't look so terrified. lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. Honor made you leave, honor brought you back. My friends brought me back. l didn't say it was your honor. - They killed my father. - And you're gonna bring him back to life? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours? No. When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne? - No. - Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow. Beyond the Wall? l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the white walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow Move out! ..are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war? ls this your command, Khaleesi? Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the free cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days. They were not given to me to sell. Khaleesi, my Queen l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not. l must. You don't understand Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn. ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives. Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me. l am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria.", "summary": ["Plot As tragic news spreads across the Seven Kingdoms, Bran and Rickon share a prophetic dream, Catelyn interrogates Jaime about her son's fall, and Robb's destiny is forever changed. After a surprising decision by his father, Tyrion heads south to King's Landing. Meanwhile, Arya must conceal herself under a new identity in an attempt to escape King's Landing, and Sansa is terrorized by Joffrey. At Castle Black, Jon is forced to choose between the Night's Watch and his family. Across the sea, Dany pays a terrible price to save Drogo, but finds new hope when her dragon eggs hatch and three dragons are born.  Synopsis In King's Landing At the Great Sept of Baelor, Eddard Stark has been executed by beheading. The great sword Ice is covered in blood, and Sandor Clegane standing next to Ser Ilyn Payne, the royal executioner, holds Lord Eddard's head up to the adulation of the baying crowd. Sansa Stark has fainted. In the crowd, Yoren drags Arya away, making a point of calling her \"Boy\". Once he gets her out of the courtyard, he cuts her hair off with a knife. He tells her that he will get her out of King's Landing and to Winterfell as a recruit of the Night's Watch, but he warns her not to trust the other recruits, since apparently half would hand her over to Cersei for a pardon, while the other half would do the same, but only after raping her first.  Joffrey is holding court and a singer is brought before him, charged with making up an amusing but offensive song about Robert and Cersei. The song says that the boar might have killed King Robert, but the lion in his bed had previously castrated him. The singer turns out to be Marillion, who Catelyn and Ser Rodrik met at the Inn at the Crossroads, and who accompanied them and Tyrion to the Vale of Arryn. Joffrey asks Marillion if he wants to keep his hands or tongue. Marillion fearfully responds that everyone needs hands. Joffrey commands Ilyn Payne to cut out his tongue instead. Joffrey then takes Sansa up to the walls to see her father's head mounted on a spike and makes her look at it. He cruelly mocks her, promising he will give her Robb's head next. Sansa quietly retorts that Robb might give her Joffrey's instead. Infuriated, Joffrey orders Ser Meryn Trant to beat her, as Cersei has told him that a king should not hit his queen. Sansa moves up behind Joffrey, apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death, but unexpectedly Sandor Clegane dabs the blood off her lip with a handkerchief and after Joffrey leaves, tells her to give him what he wants.  Cersei and Lancel Lancel and Cersei.  Cersei Lannister has taken a new lover, her cousin Lancel who was King Robert's squire. She also receives a letter informing her of Jaime's capture. Lancel is naked in Cersei's bedroom. The thought of being at war is exciting to him, as he has just been made a new young knight. He asks for the news of the war and asks what their next move is, but Cersei tells him to shut up and get back in bed.  Grand Maester Pycelle takes the prostitute Ros to bed, boasting of the several great kings he has served, lamenting first how Aerys Targaryen devolved from a charming young man into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with fire, how Robert Baratheon was a great soldier, but perhaps not so ideal a king, before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to Joffrey. After Ros leaves, Pycelle stands and limbers up, revealing that he is not as frail in mind and body as he lets on. He resumes his act after he dresses and leaves his chamber.  Arya and Yoren 1x10 Yoren and Arya.  Yoren has assembled a band of new recruits for the Night's Watch. Pretending that Arya is a boy called \"Arry\", he has her join the group. Also in the group are Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands, and Gendry, who unknown to him, is King Robert's bastard son. He had been working for Tobho Mott, but with Robert dead, the secret funds being sent to Mott stopped, so he fired Gendry and told him he had to join the Night's Watch. Hot Pie and Lommy try to bully Arya into giving up Needle, but she angrily draws the sword, warning that she \"has already killed one fat boy\" and will happily do it again. Gendry breaks up the argument by taking Arya's side, threatening the boys with violence to keep them from picking on Arya later. Yoren now has to get them all to the Wall, a thousand leagues away, through the war-torn Riverlands. They set out.  In the North At Winterfell, Bran has another dream of the Three-Eyed Raven. He wakes up and tells Osha about how the dream always ends with the bird flying into the crypts under the castle, and he tells her he thinks his father is in the tombs. Osha takes Bran down there, and Bran tells her about the histories of some of the ancestors entombed there. They are then surprised by Shaggydog, Rickon's direwolf, who leaps out at them from the empty future tomb of Eddard Stark. Rickon calls Shaggydog off, then reveals to Bran that he had the same dream. Making their way out, Osha is still trying to tell Bran that it could be a coincidence, but outside they see Maester Luwin, who holds a letter and looks at them with such sadness that it is obviously the news of Eddard's death.  In the Riverlands Catandrobb Catelyn comforts her son, promising to avenge Eddard's death  At the House Stark camp, Catelyn stoically walks through the encampment and receives the condolences and respect of the northern bannermen, who bow to her as she passes. She makes her way into the woods around the camp.  Once she is out of everyone's sight, she breaks down, practically hyperventilating with grief. Hearing something from deeper in the woods, she finds Robb hacking his sword at a tree in anger and grief. Lady Catelyn calls to him and tells him he is ruining his sword. Robb drops the sword and falls into her arms, vowing to kill the Lannisters who murdered his father. Catelyn comforts him and promises him revenge, but only after they rescue Sansa and Arya first.  At Robb's camp, Robb and his bannermen debate whether to cooperate with Stannis or Renly Baratheon in the war against King Joffrey; Renly has greater forces, but Stannis is the elder Baratheon and next in line of succession excepting Cersei's children. Jon Umber questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all, reminding them that the North was independent of the other Kingdoms before the Targaryens threatened them with their dragons. With the dragons gone, Umber declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before Robb, calling out, \"The King in the North!\" The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new King in the North, swearing fealty to Robb.  Catelyn visits the captive Jaime Lannister who taunts her about Ned's death and offers to serve her as a lover. She hits him in the head with a rock. Jaime says that if she keeps hitting him, she can kill him and that he doesn't fear death, though Jaime probably realizes that the Starks won't kill him as long as his sister holds Sansa and Arya hostage. Catelyn tells him he has violated the laws of man and gods, and he asks where Ned's gods were when his head was cut off (he questions the existence of all gods, the Old and the New). She says there is injustice in the world because of men like him to which Jaime responds, \"There are no men like me, only me\". He admits to pushing Bran from the tower, but doesn't reveal why.  At the Lannister camp, Lord Tywin is holding a strategy meeting with his generals, and is furious that Jaime has been captured by the Starks in the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Tywin's brother Kevan describes the war as a \"catastrophe\"; in addition to Jaime's aforementioned defeat, both Stannis and Renly have claimed the Iron Throne, meaning the Lannisters are now fighting a three-front war against the Starks to the north and the competing Baratheon forces to the south. Kevan and other commanders debate whether to attack, fall back and raise reinforcement armies, or sue for peace. Tyrion points out that any chance of negotiating with Robb Stark died when his father Eddard was executed. The Lannister army is now exposed, so Tywin decides to retreat to Harrenhal, the great castle on the northern shores of Gods Eye, and use it as a base of operations. Reluctantly impressed by Tyrion's astute judgment of the situation, Tywin orders his son to go to King's Landing and serve as Acting Hand of the King in Tywin's stead. He is to control Cersei and Joffrey and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes, and kill Baelish, Varys, and Pycelle if he sees treachery. Tywin also orders Tyrion to leave his whore behind. Later on in his tent, Tyrion complains about his father to Shae, then decides to defy Tywin and take Shae to court anyway.  At the Wall Jon Snow learns of his father's death. He saddles a horse and prepares to leave to join Robb's army, ignoring Samwell's pleas to stay and fulfill his oaths. Jon leaves Castle Black, but is pursued. One of his pursuers hits a tree branch and is unhorsed, and Jon realizes it was Sam. He turns back to help him. The other riders are Grenn and Pypar. He tells them to go back or they will get in trouble too, but they say they can't go back without him. They surround him and recite their oath to the Night's Watch, and Jon realizes that they are right. Leaving would make him a deserter and an oathbreaker, something his father would never countenance if he were alive, and Jon doesn't even know if Robb would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities. He agrees to return to the Wall with them.  Lord Commander Jeor Mormont decides to overlook Jon's brief desertion, saying many have fled the Wall, only to think better of it and return. If they executed everyone who did that, they'd have no men left. Mormont tells Jon that the war between the Lannisters and Starks is less important than what they face now, a renewed threat from the wildlings, White Walkers, and wights. Mormont means to lead the Night's Watch in force into the Haunted Forest to learn more of their foe, to prepare to battle against them, and to find the missing Benjen Stark. Jon agrees to commit himself fully to the Night's Watch and all that lies ahead.  In Lhazar Dany-awake Daenerys regains consciousness.  In the wastelands beyond Lhazar, Daenerys wakes up to terrible news from Ser Jorah Mormont. Her son, Rhaego, is dead. He was born dead and deformed, covered with scales. The majority of the khalasar have also moved on, leaving them behind. However, Drogo lives. Daenerys insists on seeing her husband, and finds him in a catatonic state. Daenerys demands to know why, and Mirri Maz Duur explains that when Daenerys \"saved\" her, she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the Dothraki. They had sacked her village, looted all they owned, and those not killed were enslaved. She has now gotten her revenge, not only on Drogo, but on Daenerys' child Rhaego; now her \"Stallion Who Mounts the World\" can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents. Duur agrees that Daenerys saved her life, but she says to ask Drogo what life is worth when all else is gone.  It is night, and Daenerys is in their tent tending to Drogo. She bathes him, talks to him, even tries to seduce him, but nothing she does reaches him. She realizes he is no longer there, and seeing him in his vegetative state breaks her heart. Crying, Daenerys kisses him goodbye, then smothers him with a pillow.  Daenerys and her small retinue prepare a funeral pyre for Drogo. She makes a speech to the few who are left saying that if they wish to go they may, but if they stay with her she will lead them into a glorious future. She frees those of them who are slaves and asks that they stay as equals. The maegi smirks as some people begin walking away. At Daenerys' command, Rakharo places the dragon eggs on the pyre, and Mirri Maz Duur is tied to a stake next to the pyre as well. She tells Daenerys that she will not scream while she is burned alive. Daenerys replies that she only wants the maegi's life. Ser Jorah believes that Daenerys intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider, as they can sell the eggs and travel far away. Ignoring Jorah's pleas, she kisses his cheek, and sets the pyre alight. Mirri Maz Duur does indeed scream as she burns, and Daenerys calmly walks into the flames. She stands below the pyre as flames appear to consume her.  Daenerys and dragon Dragons return to the Known World.  At dawn, the fire dies down. Jorah and the rest of the khalasar awake to find Daenerys sitting among the still smoldering embers, with three newly-hatched baby dragons crawling over her. Her clothes have burnt away and her body is covered in ash, but she is completely unharmed. One dragon nuzzles in her arm, another climbs her leg, and the third pulls itself up to sit on her shoulder. At the sight of the mythical animals born anew, an amazed Jorah and the few remaining Dothraki kneel and swear their allegiance to the Mother of Dragons. After she slowly stands up from the ashes, the black hatchling on her shoulder rises, spreads its wings and screams, announcing the return of dragons to the world."], "review": null}, "10": {"id": "s02e01", "name": "The North Remembers", "script": "Well struck. Well struck, dog. Did you like that? It was well struck, Your Grace. I already said it was well struck. Yes, Your Grace. - Who's next? Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish. Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard. Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard! Here I am. Here I am. Sorry, Your Grace. My deepest apologies. Are you drunk? - No. No. No, Your Grace. - I had two cups of wine. - Two cups? That's not much at all. Please, have another cup. Are you sure, Your Grace? Yes. To celebrate my name day. Have two. Have as much as you like. I would be honored, Your Grace. Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill. You can't. What did you say? Did you say I can't? I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day. What kind of stupid peasant's superstition The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year. Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool. He is a fool. You're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death. Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos? From this day, you'll be my new fool. Thank you, Your Grace. And you, my lady, thank you. Beloved nephew. We looked for you on the battlefield. You were nowhere to be found. I've been here, ruling the kingdoms. What a fine job you've done. Look at you. More beautiful than ever. And you! You're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. This one doesn't like me. Can't imagine why. - We heard you were dead. - I'm glad you're not dead. Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now, with so much excitement in the world. My lady, I'm sorry for your loss. Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor. But still her father. Surely, having so recently lost your own beloved father, you can sympathize. My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey. Of course you are. Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done. What work? Why are you here? A raven arrived from the citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, considered reports from maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done at last. The longest summer in living memory. The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter. A common superstition. We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, we'll have fewer peasants. The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them. And with winter coming, it'll only get worse. You command the city watch, do you not, Lord Slynt? I do, Your Grace. And are you not a lord at my command? I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace. Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital. Yes, Your Grace. Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption. Carry on. What are you doing here? It's been a remarkable journey. I pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell, I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for. What are you doing here? This is the small council. Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings. Our father is Hand of the King. Yes, but in his absence Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead while he fights. Out! All of you out! I would like to know how you tricked Father into this. If I were capable of tricking Father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. I've done nothing. Quite right, you did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us. - I tried to stop it. - Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation. - Robb Stark is a child. - Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war? - What do you know about warfare? - Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us. - Joffrey is king. - Joffrey is king. You are here to advise him. I'm only here to advise him. And if the king listens to what I say, the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back. How? You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. - And we have two of them. - One. - One? - Arya, little animal, she disappeared. Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child. My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother and all our Northern sons. The walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall. Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast. Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war. King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it. Maybe not, my lord, but he called in his banners and took the men. Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, ser? Of course I remember! We can spare four masons for a week, my lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls? I believe it will. We didn't want him here all day, did we? I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb. Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. Lord Portan. My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother and all our Northern sons. Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away. Don't have any pain. Lucky for you. That way. You've been having those dreams again. I don't dream. Everyone dreams. I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South. Did they? I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. Heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood to mark the death of your father. The stars don't fall for men. Red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons. The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries. Mmm. What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi? He said they ate meat. He didn't tell you what kind of meat? My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything. Eh. She was Drogo's first gift to me. I remember. I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream? A trick I never learned, I'm afraid. Does it ever end? This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the Red Waste. And you're sure there's no other way? If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons. No one will take my dragons. They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength. As you are mine. Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast. What do we seek, Khaleesi? Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. Rakharo. You are my last hope, blood of my blood. I will not fail you, blood of my blood. You never have. This is bad time to start. Having a rough time of it? Nothing's killed me yet. Your arse killed the sledge. - You offered me a ride. I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters. I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times. Are those girls? Craster's daughters. I haven't seen a girl in six months. I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you. What, he don't like people messing with his daughters? He don't like people messing with his wives. He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters. And on and on it goes. - That's foul. - It's beyond foul. All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right. What happens to the boys? Hmm? He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons? He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs. People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that. We're not Southerners. Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name? - Jon Snow. - Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North. The lad meant no harm. I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth. You bring any of that good wine with you? We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone? I could tell you, but I'm thirsty. There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. - Bring it in here. Yes, Commander. You want to know where they've all gone? North, to join up with Mance Rayder. Your old friend. He's no friend of mine. - He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers. - Aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall. He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere? That's a good-looking ax. Fresh forged? Give it here. You'll have another one made at Castle Black. Here. That's some lovely steel. You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your Southern Kings. And where does he plan marching this army? When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go. These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising. Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are. This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave. Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed? We chose different paths. Aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs. A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you. Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out. Your roof, your rules. Who am I? - Who am I? - Lord Commander. - And who are you? - Jon Snow. Who are you? Your steward. You want to lead one day? Then learn how to follow. Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false gods. Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and full of terrors. For the night is dark and full of terrors. After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. The stars will bleed. We need to stop her. The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas - Not now. and the dead shall rise in the North. All you men were named in the light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors? You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me. In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, Warrior of Light, your sword awaits you. Lord, cast your light upon us! For the night is dark and full of terrors. For the night is dark and full of terror. This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win. Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, - even if we don't like the path. - King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation. I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis. As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. If you tell him the truth What's the truth? \"And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert\" He wasn't my beloved brother. I didn't love him. He didn't love me. A harmless courtesy, Your Grace. A lie. Take it out. \"That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, \"the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest \"between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. - \"By right of birth\" - Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is. \"And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.\" \"By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim\" Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight. \"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. \"By right of birth and blood, \"I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. \"Let all true men declare their loyalty.\" When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse. Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself king. Well, many have already declared for him, Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly. Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him. And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet? - He has no need for ships. I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark. Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them. I owe you an apology, my king. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new god over the old gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together? Don't. A cup of wine to honor the one true god. The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl. If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, \"Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. \"Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.\" You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle? Oh, I trust them with my life, just not with yours. Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called \"boy\"? Insulted? You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy. You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. He's your bastard son. If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him. My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed. I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head. Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you, you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen. You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives? I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms. You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well. No, but he's starting to know me. Three victories don't make you a conqueror. It's better than three defeats. This city stinks. Like dead bodies. A bit corpsey, yes. And shit. I thought you wanted to come here. I love it. You love the smell of dead bodies and shit? And cum and garlic and rum. You can smell cum from the balcony? I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck. And so did the country. This is where I belong. Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here. No one will know. You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars, good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars. What about you? Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth. Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met. Why do you think I am so little? I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth. Ned Stark actually slept on this. As if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here. Lord Baelish. Your Grace. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. Of course, Your Grace. Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya, we can't seem to locate her. If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination. And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her. Curious. If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her Well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts. Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want? A mockingbird. - You created your own sigil, didn't you? - Yes. Appropriate, for a self-made man with so many songs to sing. I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way. I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another. When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when those affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found. And which truth is that? Knowledge is power. Seize him. Cut his throat. Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it. You're Ser Alton Lannister? I am, Your Grace. I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals. - An honorable request, Your Grace. - Third Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom. The King in the North. - King in the North. - King in the North. Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me. These are Your Grace, these are These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the South with Lannister dead. King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace. Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight. A word, Your Grace? You don't have to call me \"Your Grace\" when no one's around. It's not so bad once you get used to it. I'm glad someone's gotten used to it. The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know? Of course they are. We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them. Men who fought my father. Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together. You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally. I need his ships. They say he has 200. They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us? I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy. I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion. Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was Father. You married one rebel and mothered another. I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten. If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet. You want to leave Sansa in the queen's hands? And Arya I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for, if not for them? It's more complicated than that! You know it is. It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months. You can't go to Winterfell. I beg your pardon? I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands. Why in the name of all the gods Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family. I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home, for good. I will ride at first light. We will all be together again soon, I promise. You've done so well. Your father would be proud. - Give Lord Renly my regards. - King Renly. There's a king in every corner now. What is all this? Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers. We can't find Arya Stark. With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere. Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone. I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked Grandfather The king does not ask, he commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place. His life is in danger. We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you. Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne. It's not a claim. The throne is mine. Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip. Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella? What are you asking? I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. That will be all, Mother. No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion. Oh, yeah. Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight. We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall. - Haystack Hall. - Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to plowmen and goat herders. Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here. Littlefinger's a fancy man. Don't call him Littlefinger. He doesn't like it. Lord Baelish. She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in Flea Bottom. She's beautiful. She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. Lord Commander. Good to see you again. You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets. - Orders. - Whose orders? Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks. No, you can't. No! Please! No! Not my Barra! - Please. Please. - Enough. Get it done. - Kill the bastard. No, no! - Please. - Give it here. No, please. Spread out. Search every house. Every room. Look in every room. Gendry! His name is Gendry. Where is the bastard? The Night's Watch! Please, stop! Where? They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north. - How will we know him? - He's got a bull's head helmet. - He made it himself. - Find him.", "summary": ["Plot As Robb Stark and his northern army continue the war against the Lannisters, Tyrion arrives in King's Landing to counsel Joffrey and temper the young king's excesses. On the island of Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon plots an invasion to claim his late brother's throne, allying himself with the fiery Melisandre, a strange priestess of a stranger god. Across the sea, Daenerys, her three young dragons, and khalasar trek through the Red Waste in search of allies, or water. In the North, Bran presides over a threadbare Winterfell while, beyond the Wall, Jon Snow and the Night's Watch must shelter with a devious wildling.  Summary At Craster's Keep Sam, Edd and Jon 2x01 The Night's Watch approaches Crasters Keep.  Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's rangers arrive at Craster's Keep having passed several abandoned wildling villages. Jon Snow, Grenn, Dolorous Edd and Samwell Tarly are repulsed by Craster, who has many wives, most of whom are also his own daughters, but who seemingly has no sons. Craster tells Jeor that he has not seen the missing Benjen Stark and reports that the other wildlings are assembling for the King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. Jon challenges their host, who is low and crude, but is demanding and demeaning when he is talking to the noble Commander Mormont (who ignores his insulting behavior). When Craster refers to them as southerners, Jon argues with him. Jeor reprimands Jon, noting that Craster may be disgusting, but the Night's Watch needs him. His information and shelter in the harsh conditions north of the Wall have helped them many times before. Mormont asks Jon if someday he wants to lead and tells him that first he needs to \"learn how to follow.\"  In King's Landing SansaWatchesTourneySeason2 Sansa watches King Joffrey's tournament.  King Joffrey Baratheon holds a tournament to celebrate his nameday on the walls of the Red Keep. He is irritated by Ser Dontos Hollard, who arrives both late and intoxicated for his bout. Joffrey orders his guards to pour an entire barrel of wine down Dontos' throat with a funnel. Sansa Stark intercedes telling Joffrey that ordering a death on one's name day is bad luck. Joffrey dismisses this as a mindless superstition, but Sandor Clegane seconds her. Sansa convinces Joffrey to instead make Dontos his court fool, for which Dontos is grateful. Tyrion Lannister arrives back in King's Landing, to Joffrey's disdain, but to the delight of Tommen and Myrcella who had worried that he was dead.  CerseiSeason2NorthRemembers Cersei is surprised to see Tyrion return.  The small council are in session to discuss the Conclave's announcement that the long summer has ended. Cersei orders the city gates closed to refugees from the war in the Riverlands. When Tyrion arrives with a letter from Lord Tywin, appointing him as acting Hand of the King in Tywin's stead, Cersei becomes livid. She is suspicious that Tyrion is taking power for himself, but he convinces her that he is there to act as an advisor. He criticizes his sister for failing to rein in Joffrey and overseeing numerous bad decisions, particularly the execution of Ned Stark. Their actions have sparked a war, which, he adds, their side is currently losing. He is even more incredulous when he learns that Arya Stark escaped, pointing out how much stronger their position could have been with three Stark hostages. Tyrion hides his lover Shae in his chambers in the Tower of the Hand because he was forbidden by his father to bring her with him. She is initially thrilled at being brought to the capital, and says that big cities make her \"want to fuck\".  Cersei Little Finger Season2 Cersei asks a favor of Lord Baelish.  Cersei tasks Petyr Baelish with finding Arya. She needles Petyr about his unrequited love for Catelyn and he counters by referencing her relationship with Jaime, telling her that knowledge is power. She responds by threatening his life in a demonstration of her control over her guards, ordering them to first seize Baelish and cut his throat and almost immediately rescinding the order. She warns him that power is power.  Joffrey redecorates his throne room, hoping to restore the intimidating grandeur it held under the Targaryens. He refuses his mother's suggestion that they ask Tywin Lannister for aid in the search for Arya because he does not feel it is necessary to find her and does not feel it is fitting for a king to ask for help. He blames Tywin for their losses in the war and the capture of Jaime. Having heard rumors about his parentage, he confronts his mother. She dismisses it as gossip spread by his enemies. He questions her about his father's bastard children and insults her by saying that Robert had grown tired of her. She slaps him, and he warns her never to hit him again under threat of death.  Lord Janos Slynt leads a city-wide massacre of Robert's bastards. The infant Barra is killed in Petyr's brothel in front of her mother and the prostitute Ros. Tobho Mott is interrogated and reveals that Gendry has left the city as a recruit of the Night's Watch. He says that Gendry can be identified by his bull's head helm. Gendry and Arya are travelling north on the Kingsroad with Yoren's recruits.  At Winterfell At Winterfell, Bran Stark suffers through the petty complaints of his vassals, facing unrest at Robb Stark calling his banners and taking the young men south. Maester Luwin guides him in carrying out a lord's duties. Bran dreams that he is his direwolf Summer walking in the Godswood, and when he looks in the pool, he sees Summer's reflection rather than his own, which wakes him. He has Osha and Hodor take him to the pool and is reassured to find that his waking reflection is his own. They discuss the phenomenon of the Red Comet, as many people think it means different things. Osha tells him she believes it signifies the return of dragons to the world.  On Dragonstone Lord cast your light upon us Stannis orders the burning of the Seven to honor the Lord of Light.  On the island of Dragonstone, King Stannis Baratheon allows his advisor Melisandre to burn statues of the gods of the Faith of the Seven as an offering to her deity the Lord of Light. Maester Cressen is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that Melisandre is leading Stannis into a war that he cannot win. Melisandre proclaims Stannis a champion of the Lord of Light, as he draws a burning sword from one of the statues. Cressen asks Davos Seaworth to help him intervene but Davos says that it is not the right time.  Painted Table Dragon motif 2x01 Stannis dictates a letter about Joffrey's parentage.  Stannis has received Ned Stark's letter, informing him that he was the true heir of King Robert Baratheon, so he will send copies of a letter announcing his claim to the throne of the Seven Kingdoms to Lords throughout the realm. He details the incestuous relationship between Cersei and Jaime Lannister and challenges Joffrey's legitimacy. He rejects Davos's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother Renly Baratheon, while Renly is claiming the throne for himself, despite Renly having widespread support, or even with Robb Stark, since while Robb does not seek the Iron Throne, he desires Northern independence, which Stannis sees as Robb \"stealing the Northern half of his kingdom.\" Cressen feigns an apology in an effort to trick Melisandre into sharing a cup of poisoned wine with him. Davos sees him drop the poison in the cup, and tries to stop him. He drinks first and hands the cup to her. Melisandre is aware of what Cressen is doing, but smiling she drinks anyway and is unaffected by the poison, and Cressen dies in vain.  RobbtalkstoJaimeSeason2 Robb confronts Jaime with his direwolf.  In the Riverlands GreyWindJaimeFaceToFace Grey Wind and Jaime.  Robb receives the letter and interrogates the captive Jaime about his reasons for crippling Bran. Jaime reveals nothing and attacks Robb's decision to keep him in his mobile camp rather than with one of his bannermen as demonstrating a lack of trust. Robb asserts his faith in his men and his concern at the lengths House Lannister would go to in order to free Jaime. His direwolf Grey Wind is almost fully grown and menaces Jaime during the questioning. Robb sends his prisoner Alton Lannister to King's Landing with peace terms. His demands include the release of his sisters, the return of his father's remains along with the remains of all those who served him, and the recognition of the North as a free and independent kingdom. Theon Greyjoy appeals to Robb to send him to Pyke to seek an alliance with his father Balon citing their need for a fleet in order to attack King's Landing. Catelyn counsels against putting trust in Balon because of his history of rebellion. She asks Robb to consider exchanging Jaime for his sisters. She then asks to return to her younger sons at Winterfell but Robb tasks her with seeking an alliance with Renly and sends Ser Rodrik Cassel instead to Winterfell.  In the Red Waste Dany-wasteSeason2 Daenerys leads her people through the Red Waste.  Daenerys Targaryen leads her diminished khalasar east into the Red Waste to avoid her rivals. She is surrounded by powerful enemies who Ser Jorah tells her will kill her and take her dragons. The deadly emptiness of the Red Waste is her only option. She struggles to make her dragons eat what little meat she has, and her people face starvation. Her beloved white mare, her first gift from Khal Drogo, dies prompting her to halt the march and send three of her bloodriders in three different directions to scout for sustenance and refuge."], "review": null}, "11": {"id": "s02e02", "name": "The Night Lands", "script": "Gotta be ready before nightfall. Now keep it moving. Put a watch on the ridge and the tree lines. Boy. Lovely boy. What do you want? A man has a thirst. A man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend. I have friends. Give us beer before I skin you. A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. You're called Arry? This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar, once of the Free City of Lorath Beer, you little shit. Get us beer! You should have asked nicely. Aah! Come closer and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody. That boy has more courage than sense. Come here! Yoren said none of us were to go near those three. Come here! They don't scare me. Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me. What are gold cloaks doing so far from King's Landing? What are you doing? They're looking for me. You in command here? You're a long way from home. I asked you a question. Aye, you did. You asked without manners and I chose not to answer. I have a royal warrant for one of these gutter rats you're transporting. Well, the thing is these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens. Does it? It's a funny thing, people worry so much about their throats that they forget about what's down low. Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or I could nick this artery in your leg. And once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it. We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the Wall. Seems you have a choice, you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home, or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for. We're looking for a boy named Gendry. He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back with more men and I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy. My lord. You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company. We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces. It was quite a battle. I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors. And I tell him the story of how we meet. To find so lovely a creature working in your father's kitchens It almost beggars belief. Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie. I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie. - How can you tell? - I can always tell. Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy, my lord. I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends. Your discretion is legendary Where your friends are concerned. How unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. Welcome to King's Landing, my dear. This city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord. I don't like threats. Who threatened you? I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played. Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not. Threaten me again and I'll have you thrown into the sea. You might be disappointed in the results. Storms come and go, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting. CERSEl: \"From this time until the end of time, \"we are not part of your realm, \"but a free and independent Kingdom of the North. \" He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that. You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. We can give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith. You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin? I will, Your Grace. Did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest? I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace. If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten. I will, Your Grace. - Safe travels, cousin. You have a deft hand with diplomacy. If that's everything A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black. Trouble with the wildlings. That's why they're called \"wildlings. \" Somewhat less wild these days. Seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this king-beyond-the-Wall. Another king? How many is that now? Five? I've lost count. The Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man the Wall. Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare. \"The cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them. \" The northerners are a superstitious people. According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. Mormont doesn't lie. How do you kill a dead man? Apparently you burn him. One trip to the Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you: the Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall. I have every confidence that the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all. And I said, \"If the gods wanted us to have dignity, \"they wouldn't make us fart when we died. \" We fart when we die? My blessed mother, I was holding her hand when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook. Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two or three be enough for him? We were having a serious discussion. Would you look at that? Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away. I prefer watching them come towards me. I'm sure that's nice, too. Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. We were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older and the wrestling changed. You were with her? How many times? Well, as many times as I could. I wish I grew up on a farm. We need more potatoes. Get another sack from the sledge. Get the turnips, too. No. Ghost, no. No! Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! You all right? - Did he frighten you? - You shouldn't touch me. Oh. Oh, right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. You're very brave. What are you doing? This is Gilly. She's one of Craster's daughters. Hello, Gilly. What are you doing? Sam said you could help. I'm sorry, but Sam knows we're not supposed She's pregnant. We have to take her with us when we leave. What? - What would that I know it sounds a bit mad. No, it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible. - The Lord Commander ordered us to - We are sworn to protect. - Sam, we can't take - Please, sir, please. I can still run if I have to. - It's just not possible. - I'm going to have a baby. If it's a boy If it's a boy, what? You want us to risk our lives for you and you won't even tell us why? - Why'd you do that? - Do what? Ask her a question? - You were cruel. - Cruel? Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand? - I didn't touch her. - No, you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that? I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat. We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's going to deliver a baby, you? I could try. What? I've read about it. A bit. I'm sorry, Sam. We can't help her. Khaleesi. - You don't need to see this. - He is blood of my blood. - Who did this? - Khal Pono, perhaps. Khal Jhaqo. They don't like the idea of a woman leading a khalasar. They will like it far less when I am done with them. They killed his soul! Shh. They cannot kill his soul. They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. He can neverjoin his ancestors in the night lands. Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre. And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight. Is it as you remember, my lord? It looks smaller. Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it. They'll be waiting for me on the docks. Who will? Anyone who matters. This is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place, the Iron Islands. Always has been. It's cold and it's wet. Oh, I love the cold and wet. They say hard places breed hard men. And hard men rule the world. Then you'll be king before long. Try smiling with your lips closed. Better. My father doesn't trust you Iron Islanders. I don't blame him. He says that you're all reavers and rapers and that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be sat Quit talking about your father. But he's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take salt wives, the women we capture. Capture me. Take me with you when you go ashore. - Make me your salt wife. - Your place is on this ship. Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore. I haven't paid you. Oh, yeah. I paid good money I'm not going to stand for this. I barely touched her. Now, you charge twice as much as every other brothel and this is what I get, crying. One moment, my friend. A moment. Please accept my sincerest apologies. Aremca will take good care of you. I'm sorry, my lord. Did he hurt you? No, my lord. It's Mhaegen. Who? She works for you. She's the one The gold cloaks, - they killed her baby. - Ah, yes. That was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't sleep. Her poor little baby. You know, you remind me of another girl, a lovely thing I once acquired from a Lysene pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent, like yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried often. I asked her why, but we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses are expensive, extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that would never occur to most men. But you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy, but my losses were definitely mitigated. Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. And you'll be happy? That makes me happy. More wine? Damn it, boy! Apologies, my lord. Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine. That's your new squire? I could've found you a proper lad. Myself, I prefer the improper ones. That's a good red. Dornish? You know your wines, my lord. That I do. A fine dinner, my lord. Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord. Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours. Wars have been started for less. I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night. Mmm. Nasty business. - Had to be done. - Yes, of course. The City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies. - Orders are orders. - Quite right. Especially the Queen's orders. I never said they were the Queen's orders. No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman. You know your sister better than I do. You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister? I don't listen to filth. That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children. Joffrey is my king. The rest doesn't interest me. I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order? I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty. The fool. He had no idea you were already bought. Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an imp! I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence. If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And, yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here. I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war. And seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about. What are you My friends at court will not allow this! - The Queen herself has granted - The Queen Regent. And you're a fool to believe she is your friend. We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this. No, we shan't. There's a ship leaving for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid, it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way. The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord. These men are under my command! I command you to arrest this cutthroat. His name is Bronn, and he is the new commander of the City Watch. Boys. I have friends at court, powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord! To the new commander. If I told you to murder an infant girl, say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question? Without question? No. I'd ask, \"How much?\" If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. Don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle. I ain't afraid of no battles. If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants. I've seen lots of battles. - I saw - Liar. I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck. Two men fighting isn't a battle. - They had armor on. - So? So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle. No, it isn't. What does a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway? Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes a fight into a battle. It's when they've got armor on. Who told you that? A knight. How'd you know he was a knight? Well, it was 'cause he'd got armor on. You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. How do you know? 'Cause I sold armor. What do the gold cloaks want with you? - No idea. - You're a liar. You know, you shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you. Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. I don't care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions. No good's ever come? Who asked questions before? How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my arse? Who asked questions? The Hand of the King. Hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first a few weeks before he died, and then Lord Stark came a few weeks before he died. Lord Stark? See? Asking me questions is bad luck. You'll probably be dead soon. - What did they ask about? - My mum. - Who's your mum? - Just my mum, worked in a tavern, died when I was little. And who was your father? Could've been one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you anyway? You thought they were after you. Why? Did you kill someone or is it just because you're a girl? - I'm not a girl. - Yes, you are. Do you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them? Stupider. The Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that. - Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl. - I am not! Yeah? Well, pull your cock out and take a piss, then. I don't need to take a piss. Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know. Well, they won't. Not from me. My name's not Arry. It's Arya, of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell. He was your father, the Hand, the traitor. He was never a traitor. Joffrey is a liar. So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady. No. I mean, yes. My mother was a lady and my sister Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter, and you lived in a castle and you Look, all that about cocks, I should never have said And I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you \"my lady. \" - Do not call me \"my lady. \" - As my lady commands. Well, that was unladylike. Oh! What's she carrying? Myrish oranges, wine from the Arbor and the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands. The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. Me. I don't like wine. Woman's drink. I need to get to Pyke. I'll find you a horse. I'm heading that way. I can take you there. I bet you can. Have you been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from? - None like you. - You don't know what I'm like. Maybe you don't know what you're like. Maybe you need someone to teach you. Do you know who I am? You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry, Lord Greyjoy? Have my things sent up to the castle. You should give me the reins. I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the past nine years. Nine years? Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope? Don't you worry about my hands. The sea is in my blood. Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going. I have a proposal for my father, one that will make him king again, and me after him. You may get to stay in a castle tonight if you're lucky. Is that an offer from my future king? An order from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night. I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children. Father. Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back? A man. - Your blood and your heir. - We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did. Lord Stark is gone. And how do you feel about that? What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark. Who gave you those clothes? Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter? If my clothes offend you, I will change them. You will. That bauble round your neck, did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold? I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold? Gold. I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. My fears have come true, the Starks have made you theirs. - My blood is salt and iron. - Yet the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven clutching his message. The offer he makes is one I proposed. - He heeds your counsel? - I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side. He thinks of me as a brother. No, not here, not in my hearing. You will not name him brother, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood? I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king. I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again. - I will lead the attack myself. - Oh, you will? I'm your son, your only living heir. Who else? I told you to wait outside. How did you get past the guards? Anything with a cock is easy to fool. My dear. Yara? So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about. - She can't lead an attack! And why not? You're a woman! - You're the one in skirts. - This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him. - What's dead may never die. -  dead may never die. The only nights she's spent off these islands have been spent on the sea. She's commanded men. She's killed men. She knows who she is. No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown, for that is who I am. That is who we have always been. You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own. Who said anything about the Lannisters? You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing. All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance? Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false King Joffrey. And yet they both have larger armies. Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon or more worthy of loyalty. What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings? - Mind your words, pirate. - Matthos. You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises. Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise, a promise that somewhere on the sea, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from him. - That's a promise that always comes true. - As is mine. You're not a young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong, most pirates don't grow old. Only the clever ones. You want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Myrenese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lys, and the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing. \"Salladhor Saan\" is a good name for songs. - It is. - One thing, I want the queen. - The queen? - Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships. And if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I'll fuck her well. This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen. I'm not going to rape her. I'm going to fuck her. As if she would just let you. You don't know how persuasive I am. I've never tried to fuck you. Stannis is the rightful king and the Lord of Light, the one true god I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true gods. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet, a queen's legs. I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son. He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen. You believe your king can win? He is the one true king. You Westerosi are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You're the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich. Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will. When will the king have us sail? As soon as his god wills it. He's my god, too, and yours, but you are too blind to see. - Let me teach you how to read. - Oh, you and your mother. It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be. I wish I had a god, truly. I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every god there is, pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. - None of it works. - But you always came home. I wasn't praying. But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed for you. You want me to have a god? Fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read. You'll be a knight someday. You think a fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis, only Stannis. Stannis is my king, but he's only a man. Don't tell him that. CERSEl: Lord Janos Slynt was commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him. I have every right. I am the King's Hand. You're serving as the King's Hand till Father gets here. I am Queen Regent. Listen to me, Queen Regent. You're losing the people. - Do you hear me? - The people. You think I care? You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them their rallying cry, \"The Queen slaughters babies. \" You don't even have the decency to deny it. It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse. He did what needed to be done. You want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is, lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root, one by one, before they strangle you in your sleep. I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that. I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. It's all fallen on me. As has Jaime, repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon. You're funny. You've always been funny but none of yourjokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember? Back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death? She was my mother, too. Mother gone for the sake of you. There's no biggerjoke in the world than that. - Your Grace. - Your Grace. How did you fare with your pirate? Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships. His men know how to fight. In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men. It does seem the wiser choice. There won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him? Salladhor Saan is an old friend. I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him. Now, once he gets the smell of gold he never stops. Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us. At once, Your Grace. The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior. Come. What did you say to him? I told him death by fire is the purest death. - Why? - Because it is true. You're troubled, my king. Yeah. These armies are toys for the Lord of Light. Tell your lord to burn them, then. I tell him nothing. I pray for his commands and I obey. My little brother has 100,000 men, according to the scouts, men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me. You must have faith. Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins, nine times out of ten. Then we must be the 1 Oth. I cannot defeat my brother in the field. And I can't take King's Landing without the men he's stolen. I have seen the path to victory in the flames. But first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light. I've said the words, damn you. I burned the idols. You must give all of yourself. I have a wife. I took a vow. She's sickly, weak Shut away in a tower. She disgusts you. And she's given you nothing, no sons, only stillborns, only death. I will give you a son, my king. A son?", "summary": ["Plot In the wake of a bloody purge in the capital, Tyrion chastens Cersei for alienating the king's subjects.

Arya asks Gendry why he is wanted and he admits that he does not know. He tells her that he was questioned by Lord Jon Arryn and Lord Eddard Stark in the months before he fled King's Landing.

He delivers Robb Stark's letter suggesting an alliance against House Lannister, for which Robb will make Balon King of the Iron Islands again. His guide enters and he is shocked to realize that she is his sister Yara when Balon greets her warmly. Balon rejects the proposal and compares Theon unfavorably to his sister. He insists that he will follow the ironborn tradition of paying the iron price (meaning to take something through force) and says that no one will give him his crown.

This bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't! I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right. Wait outside. - Lord Commander - Now! - Lord Commander - Leave us. What did you do? I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn. What business is that of yours? No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys. You know. Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings. Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster. Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster. I I saw it. I saw something take that child. Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn. Don't lose it again. Gilly. You're leaving. I I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother. - I can't take it. - Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall. You You shouldn't give it away. I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you. Keep it safe for me. Till I come back. Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons. Every night it's the same. I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves. That's exactly what they are, Bran, - stories. - So she was lying? - They don't exist? - Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more. No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream. What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right. This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on. All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten. Loras! Highgarden! Get him! Oh! Yield! I yield. Well fought. Approach. Rise. Remove your helm. You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion. Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you. That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours. Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard. What? I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm. Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard. Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell. Lord of Winterfell and King in the North. Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell? You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss. You are most kind. My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head. It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord. Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King. There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest. Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet? I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you. If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts. My son is fighting a war, not playing at one. Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning. - Your Grace. - Gerard. - How's your foot? - Better, Your Grace. They don't know their own size is all. Good man. I have 100,000 men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach. And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? - I pity them. - Why? Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming. Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. - She's tired from herjourney. At once, Your Grace. - Shall I return after? - That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone. If you'll follow me, my lady. You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne. I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady. What are you doing here? I live here. Are you angry with me, brother? You lying bitch. It's not my fault you didn't recognize me. Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you you looked like a fat little boy. You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to see who you were first. And I did. The plans are made. It's time you heard them. - Father. - Father. The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall. Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte. I've always wanted a castle. And what's my role in all this? You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore. A ship? You give her 30 and I get one? The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you. I'm to fight fishermen? Be careful of their nets. Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. - He won't give up the North so easily. - They won't even know we're there - until it's too late. - What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior. Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect. I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock. What are our words? Our words? - We do not sow. - We do not sow. We are ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak. You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then? You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home. You'd have our father bow down to your other family? I have no other family. Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you. You won't let me leave this room. - You won't let me - Keep your voice down. Why? You think your father can hear me? He's 300 miles away! I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens. Again, only temporary. Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am. But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion. Scullion? What is a scullion? Kitchen wench. - A kitchen wench? - Yes, but Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me? Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you. I'm the weakness? It's a compliment, my lady. How is being a weakness a compliment? Language can be a bit tricky here. Oh. I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench. When will Joffrey and Sansa be married? Soon, darling, when the war is over. Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride. The Princess just spoke to you. Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods. Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother? He might. Would you like that? No. I don't think so. Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove? Come in. Who are you? I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden. I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. - You're not from here. - No. What are you doing? Waiting for you to tell me what to do. I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them. What things? Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair. - No. - You said to brush Not now. Your chamber pot is empty. Clean the table. Have you ever been a handmaiden before? - Yes. - For whom? - Lady Zuriff. - Lady Zuriff? Lady Zuriff. There is no Lady Zuriff in this city. She wasn't in this city. I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do yourjob. Do you want me to leave? Just brush my hair. Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days. I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily. Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side. - Please. - Thank you, my lord. I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not? Why, yes, of course, my lord. These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony. Matrimony, huh? Yes. I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake. Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave. I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it. Myrcella sent away to Dorne? But remember, the Queen mustn't know. Ooh. \"The Queen mustn't know. \" I love conversations that begin this way. I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy. Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. - He fights for Robb Stark. - Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships. But remember, you must tell no one. Tell no one what? I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones. She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess? For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think? And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement? Who better? Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me? The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold and Harrenhal. Harrenhal is cursed. Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands. With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm. You served my family well in the matter of the succession. So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away. I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then? Good. Oh. And remember The Queen mustn't know. That must hurt. What? What is it? A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already. Brienne is a very capable warrior. And she's devoted to me. You're jealous. Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh. - I'll make it up to you. - No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone. Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night. And Margaery's a virgin? Officially. Shall I bring her to you? I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine. As is your right. You are a king. You look very beautiful. Thank you, Your Grace. - It's a lovely gown. - You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way. You certainly don't need it. Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed. Must be the wine. Here, let me. I'm sorry. Do you want my brother to come in and help? - What? - He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him. I don't know what you're talking about. There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them. Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like. Whatever you need to do. You are a king. CERSEl: You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore? Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this. I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon. Dorne is the safest place for her. Are you mad? The Martells loathe us. That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started. - She'll be a hostage. - A guest. You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too. - It's done, Cersei. - No. - You cannot stop it. - No! Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours. Get out! Get out! Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God? - I would. - Kneel. Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel. What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand. I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she? No, afraid not. Sorry about that. And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well. Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too. Leave me out of your next deception. That's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in. Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer. No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again? - Find him? - Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt. No, you don't. No, I don't. What is the meaning of this? No, please, please. You disappoint me, Grand Maester. I am your loyal servant. So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne. No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider. See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you. The eunuch has spies everywhere. Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats. - No, no, no. - There are no goats, halfman. Well, make do. How long have you been spying for my sister? All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King. - I don't like his beard. - What? What? No. No. How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn? Lord Arryn, he knew. He knew the truth about the Queen. And he planned to act, to tell King Robert. So you poisoned him? No. Never. But you let him die, made sure he succumbed. Lannister I always served Lannister. Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells. No. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me! For your trouble. You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service. Good. One of my better ideas. And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell? Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle The Small Council grows smaller every day. The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave. Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles? Why, am I about to hear one? Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies? Depends on the sellsword. Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods. He has a sword, the power of life and death. But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else? I've decided I don't like riddles. Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow. You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us. I can't sleep. I don't like the taste. You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest. What? How do you sleep? Same as most men, I think. But you've seen things, horrible things. Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many. How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head? You didn't see that. I made damn sure. I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and and my sister. You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. That'll help you sleep, eh? Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves. Get up. Get up. Keep out of sight, both of you. - No, I'm not afraid. - I can fight. Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back. Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now! Come on, move, move! Gold cloaks! Everyone out! Hey, you! Open the damn cage! Where's the bastard, crow? Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking? Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King. Now, which king would that be? This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons. I don't think I will. So be it. I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load. Boy, come here. Boy! - Sweet boy, help us. - Come back here! Help us, boy! A man can fight! Free us! Quick, give it to me. Give me the ax. Give me that. Put them on the wagon! There's more here. Come on. What do we have here? No! That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it. I yield! I yield! Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal. You heard him. You're coming with us. I yield! Help! Help me! Something wrong with your leg, boy? Look at it. Can you walk? No. You got to carry me. All right. \"Carry him,\" he says. We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs. You want Gendry? You already got him. He loved that helmet.", "summary": null, "review": null}, "13": {"id": "s02e04", "name": "Garden of Bones", "script": "It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. - He's the strongest. - Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight. If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime. If he ever gets out. Loras Tyrell? Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen. I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them. How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead. The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses. They get spooked by their own shadows. Do you hear that? No. There's something out there. Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face. I swear you pissed yourself. \"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!\" There is something out there. Yeah, don't even try me. - Rennick. - Do you think I'm an idiot? Rennick! King in the North! The King in the North! Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own. We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton. Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans. I doubt it. Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, \"A naked man has few secrets. \"A flayed man none. \" My father outlawed flaying in the North. - We're not in the North. - We're not torturing them. The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it. The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters. No, don't! Don't! Please! The rot's set in. No, don't! No, don't! - Shh. - Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt. The rot will spread. If we don't take the foot now No, you can't! Ser! Please, ser. - I can't lose - You'll die if she doesn't. I don't want to be a cripple, please. Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub. Your men are not my men, my lord. Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch. - No! You can't! - Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me. - What's your name? - Talisa. Your last name? You want to know what side my family fights on? You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage. That boy lost his foot on your orders. They killed my father. - That boy did? - The family he fights for. Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago. I have no hatred for the lad. That should help his foot grow back. You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey. - You're going to kill Joffrey? - If the gods give me strength. - And then what? - I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne. So who will? I don't know. You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after? First we have to win the war. You never told me where you're from. - Volantis. - Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here. He was unlucky that you were. You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons. Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage. Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain. Killing you would send your brother a message. But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn. Leave her face. I like her pretty. Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her. If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder. What is the meaning of this? What kind of knight beats a helpless girl? The kind who serves his king, Imp. Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak. Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor? I'm punishing her. For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit. You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes! The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him? No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard. I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference? I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement? I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love. Lady Stark, you may survive us yet. The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains. You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him? There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out. What are you doing here, dog? Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it. And? What is it? Look inside, Your Grace. Your Grace. - Happy nameday, Your Grace. - My nameday has passed. We won't tell if you won't. No. Her. Touch her. Could you hit her? My uncle sent you? Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself. Hmm. Use this. Harder. I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth. Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure. Please, Your Grace. Your Grace, if your uncle finds out Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you. Begin. Harder! Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long. Your Grace. Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron? I'm a practical man. Just not a loyal one. And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse? I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here? You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge. You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim. Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head. I would give priority to my head. I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates. Your Grace. Lord Baelish. All of these tents look the same to me. - Would you be so kind - It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again. \"Your tent\"? Not \"Our tent\"? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne. I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers. If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now. The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side. And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then? You seem quite interested in our marriage. Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else. You've never married, have you? I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly. That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night. This isn't your horse. It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth. Qarth? Three days to the east, on the sea. Will they let us in? They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons. What do you know of this place? Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows. - Go on! - You, keep moving! Bring her about! What kind of fire melts stone? Dragon fire. There's dragons here? No, all the dragons are dead. What's that smell? Dead people. Move. Please, please, no, no! No. He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that. They take someone every day? Does anyone live? Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. How dare you? You may have heard false reports. - You betrayed Ned. - Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment. I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery. - No, my lady. - Get out! Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance Have you lost your mind? Get out! Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever? You have Arya, too? Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital. What do you want? The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer. Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms. I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you. You think I keep secrets from my son? Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. - I've brought you a gift. - I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith. Good faith? What's this? Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. - You may not believe - Get out. Get up, you dogs! That's him, the one who picks. The Mountain. What are you doing? He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked. You. Move, boy! Move! Is there gold and silver in the village? - I don't know. - Gems? I didn't see any. - Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know. Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know. Please. - Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know. Which of the villagers aided them? - I don't know. - Who? I - Who? - I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to - Who? - I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off! - Who helped him? - Ganes, the butcher, - and his son. - That's better. - You've been very helpful. - No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop! No! No! I told you everything! No! No! Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread. Polliver. The Mountain. Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands. I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis. - Can that truly be you? - Who else might it be? When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. - Whose banner is that? - My own. I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire? The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light. Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age. Watch yourself, Renly. No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man. You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lord's chosen, born amidst salt and smoke. Born amidst salt and smoke? - Is he a ham? That's twice I've warned you. Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers. It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me. We share a common enemy. The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes. The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power. For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you. Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners? You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king? No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king. We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see. Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors. Would you believe I loved him once? I thought we were welcome. If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi. Horde? My name is Daenerys Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen. You know me, my lord? Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons. And what should I call you? Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be. - The beauty of Quarth is legendary - Qarth. Qarth. Might we see the dragons? My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves. I am not a liar. Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value. Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates. Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well. What are you doing? You promised to receive me. We have received you. Here we are, and here you are. If you do not let us in, all of us will die. Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates. Khaleesi, please be careful. Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first. Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be. The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken. I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking. The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons. Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands. Our decision is final. Very well. I invoke soumai. I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law. Be it on your head. Welcome to Qarth, my lady. You. Is there gold or silver in the village? - I'm not from the village. - Where is the Brotherhood? I don't know what that is. You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters. What's this? We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin. Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells? Cells are overflowing, my lord. This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers? You, do you have a trade? Smith, my lord. What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy. He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. - Why? - Safer to travel, my lord. Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer. My lord. Your visits are too few, cousin. Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. - Here's your warrant. - So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep. I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp. If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that? I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately. And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei? As I said several times. And you've waited this long to deliver the information? When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay. Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf. The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn. She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn. Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl. I am a knight! An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser? You will withdraw these filthy accusations. Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother? It's not my fault! Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight? Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything. Did he tell you to fuck her, too? I only meant I did as I was bid. Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this. - Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you. - Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel. My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear. - No, I think not. - My lord? You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me. Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command. Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent. But her demands? Oh, I'll give her Pycelle. - You will? - Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length. Your Grace. Do your knucklebones bring you luck? Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean. - Fewer. - Pardon? Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them. It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of yourjustice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver. You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good. A lesson I've tried to teach my son. - Does he listen? - To me? Gods, no. But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks. I've lived within the law for 17 I want you to be a smuggler this time. Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore? The red woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again. I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways. Cleaner ways don't win wars. Are you afraid, Onion Knight? Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors. You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth? I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad. If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil. - And which are you? - Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life. Well, that must be very nice for you. - Do you love your wife? - I do. Yet you have known other women. Don't talk about my wife. I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe. And you will. Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows. Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are. These weren't here before. They've barred the passage. They can't bar our passage. Gods protect us. There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.", "summary": ["Plot Joffrey punishes Sansa for Robb's victories while Tyrion and Bronn scramble to temper the king's cruelty. Catelyn entreats Stannis and Renly to forego their ambitions and unite against the Lannisters. Dany and her exhausted khalasar arrive at the gates of Qarth, a prosperous city with strong walls and rulers who greet her outside them. Tyrion coerces a queen's man into being his eyes and ears. Arya and Gendry are taken to Harrenhal, where their lives rest in the hands of The Mountain, Gregor Clegane. Davos must revert to his old ways and smuggle Melisandre into a secret cove.  Summary At Oxcross SilentSisterOxcross A Silent Sister working on a casualty at Oxcross.  The Northern army under King Robb Stark leads a surprise night-time assault against an encamped Lannister army, which was only manned by Rennick and another Lannister guardsman, with his direwolf Grey Wind causing a considerable amount of damage. The Battle of Oxcross is a smashing victory, following through on Robb's promise to give Cersei \"another Whispering Wood.\" [1] The next day Robb surveys the battlefield as Silent Sisters tend to both Stark and Lannister wounded, while his bannerman, Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort, argues that they should kill all of the Lannister soldiers they took prisoner, because they're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down. Robb disagrees, saying they will fight honorably and follow the laws of war. Bolton concedes that some of the Lannister officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing, but Robb refuses, not wanting to give the Lannisters an excuse to torture his sisters, Sansa and Arya.  Robb sees a woman battlefield healer treating a wounded Lannister soldier. The prisoner protests when she tells him she has to amputate in order to save his life. Robb helps hold him down as she saws off the leg. The woman, who introduces herself as Talisa of Volantis, criticizes Robb for the need for this war. Robb doesn't want the Iron Throne, just revenge on Joffrey for his father's death. She is shocked to learn he doesn't care which king takes the throne after they defeat Joffrey (having declared for neither of the Baratheon brothers). He just wants them to leave the north alone afterward. She points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused, he hasn't hurt the ones who killed his father, Joffrey and Tywin Lannister. The men they slaughtered were not Tywin's main army but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the Westerlands.  At Harrenhal Harrenhal The prisoners arrive at Harrenhal.  Arya Stark, Gendry, and Hot Pie are taken by Ser Amory Lorch's group of soldiers to Harrenhal, a vast but partially ruined castle which was badly damaged during the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago by dragons' fire. Arya's group is herded in with many other prisoners the Lannister soldiers have taken, primarily peasant refugees from the Riverlands. The commander of the entire Lannister force is Ser Gregor Clegane, \"the Mountain That Rides,\" previously declared an outlaw by Eddard Stark for his raiding in the Riverlands. Now the positions are reversed, with Clegane having the support of the Iron Throne to brutalize the Rivermen. The stench of corpses is so strong that Arya notices it as soon as they are in sight of the castle. The Lannister soldiers under Ser Gregor - particularly one known as The Tickler\u2013sadistically torture many of the prisoners they have taken. One method used is to tie a bucket containing a rat to a man's abdomen, and then to hold a flame to the back of the bucket so the rat will chew its way through the man's guts. The prisoners are for the most part simple peasant refugees with no knowledge of the war, and the Lannister soldiers are savagely torturing them just because they want to know where they may have hid the few valuables they have. However, some are also asked if they know anything about a group known as \"The Brotherhood.\" Just as Gendry is about to be tortured, Lord Tywin Lannister arrives with the main host of his army, who have retreated to Harrenhal to regroup after their loss at the Battle of the Whispering Wood. The main Lannister army group led by Lord Tywin is settling in to use Harrenhal as their new main base for the ongoing campaign in the Riverlands.  Tywin orders an immediate halt to the tortures (saving Gendry), rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding, and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the castle. As a blacksmith's apprentice, Gendry's skills are of particular use to them, and he is set to work. Tywin instantly notices that \"Arry\" is really a girl dressed up in boy's clothing, criticizing his soldiers for being too foolish to notice. When he asks her why she's dressed as a boy, Arya simply explains that it was safer. Tywin is impressed with her intelligence, and takes her on as his new cupbearer while his army is based at the castle.  In King's Landing LeaveHerFace \"Leave her face, I like her pretty.\"  In King's Landing, King Joffrey Baratheon is furious when he hears of Robb Stark's decisive victory against Lannister forces. He has Sansa Stark brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated throne room, which now boasts iron spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars. Lancel Lannister tells Sansa and the assembled nobles that Robb only won the battle with trickery and sorcery. At first, Joffrey sadistically menaces Sansa by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the throne to send her brother a message. Despite being clearly terrified, Sansa refuses to give Joffrey the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty. Annoyed, he reluctantly concedes to his mother's insistence that they need Sansa alive, lowering the crossbow and ordering her to stand. ILikeHerPretty Sansa, beaten and stripped in front of the entire court.  Joffrey then sits down on the Iron Throne and commands Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard to beat and strip her as punishment, but instructs Trant to leave her face because \"I like her pretty.\" Ser Meryn punches Sansa violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword, causing her to fall down. He then rips open the back of her gown, leaving her partially naked from the waist up. As the beating continues, the entire court watches in horror, particularly a disgusted Sandor Clegane. But despite the room being filled with dozens of knights and officials, no one intervenes out of fear of Joffrey's wrath.  A furious Tyrion Lannister marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle. He orders someone to cover Sansa up and Sandor immediately steps forward, taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her. Tyrion turns his wrath upon Joffrey, berating his actions as Sansa is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming (and the fact that Joffrey doesn't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp). Furious, Joffrey proclaims that he was punishing her. Denouncing his nephew as a \"halfwit,\" Tyrion points out the absurdity of punishing Sansa for her brother's actions miles away in a war that Joffrey himself started. Now completely enraged, Joffrey bellows that as king, he can do whatever he pleases, but Tyrion again coldly counters that the Mad King thought he could do as he pleased too, which led to him being overthrown and killed.  RosAndJoffrey Joffrey torments Ros to send a message to Tyrion.  When Ser Meryn tries to support the king, Tyrion silences the Kingsguard by ordering Bronn to kill Meryn if the knight opens his mouth again. Tyrion comforts the shaken Sansa and personally escorts her out of the hall. He asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king, but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves Joffrey and will uphold her duty. Impressed, Tyrion remarks that she has learned how to survive around Joffrey and might just make it out of her situation alive, respectfully calling her \"Lady Stark.\"  Bronn suggests to Tyrion that as an angry young man, maybe what Joffrey needs is to have sex with a woman, and that they should set him up with a prostitute. Tyrion agrees that maybe this would give Joffrey a chance to release his frustrations away from Sansa. Indeed, he might even be grateful for the gesture: given that he didn't have much of a father figure in Robert Baratheon to set him straight, doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance Joffrey needs to re-establish a relationship with a male family figure. So Tyrion arranges for two prostitutes from Littlefinger's brothel, Ros and Daisy, to entertain Joffrey. Unfortunately, the attempt fails horrifically: instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes, Joffrey brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber. At crossbow-point, Joffrey forces Ros to beat Daisy unconscious, and then to dump her body in Tyrion's chambers, to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of Sansa again.  As Tyrion works in his chamber late at night, his cousin Lancel Lannister knocks on his door delivering orders from Cersei to release Grand Maester Pycelle from the dungeon at once. Despite their blood relationship Lancel clearly holds Tyrion in contempt and openly calls him \"Imp.\" Curious, Tyrion asks why Lancel is so late delivering the message. Blundering into a rather obvious trap, Lancel retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is never late. Tyrion then simply points out how odd it is that Lancel would be coming from Cersei's bedchambers in the middle of the night. Lancel nervously says Cersei often works tirelessly keeping late hours, but Tyrion also notices that he reeks of Cersei's favorite lavender oil perfume. Tyrion enquires whether Lancel was made a knight before or after he started sharing Cersei's bed. Lancel falls apart, saying that Cersei's father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to King Robert. Tyrion sarcastically asks if Cersei forced him to have sex with her too. Tyrion wonders aloud what Joffrey would do if he found out that Lancel had not only killed Joffrey's father but was also sleeping with his mother. Lancel gets down on his knees and pleads for his life. Tyrion gently instructs Lancel that he won't tell, but from now on, Lancel must report everything Cersei does back to Tyrion. As Lancel leaves, he also casually agrees that he will accede to Cersei's request and free Pycelle if she wants him as a \"pet\", though he doesn't want him back on the Small Council.  In the Stormlands Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish arrives at King Renly Baratheon's camp as a political envoy from King Joffrey Baratheon at King's Landing. He tries to gain Renly's trust by implying that if Renly does march on the capital, he will help take down the Lannisters from within (it is unclear if he is lying, but he is also ready to jump ship if the Lannisters lose, and Stannis is not an option, because Stannis despises Littlefinger); Renly is tempted by the notion, despite his dislike for Littlefinger. Littlefinger then has a conversation with Queen Margaery Tyrell in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual. He does not anticipate that Margaery seems to already know and not to care. Margaery is not a naive ingenue like Sansa Stark but versed in court strategies: she honestly believes that Renly is the best candidate for king, and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between Renly and House Tyrell. Baelish then meets with Catelyn Stark, who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death. Baelish first tries to kindle a romance with her, saying that now they are both free, it may be that they can be together. Catelyn simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking. Discouraged, he moves on to present Tyrion's offer that the Lannisters want to make a prisoner exchange with the Starks: if they release Jaime Lannister, Queen Cersei will release both Sansa Stark and Arya Stark (Baelish lies about the Lannisters having Arya). Catelyn insists that Robb would never allow the exchange, but Littlefinger tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters. As a show of good faith from Tyrion, Baelish brings forward a pair of Silent Sisters carrying a box containing the remains of Ned Stark. Deeply grieving, Catelyn tells Petyr to get out. She looks at the bones with pain, but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face.  Shadow The shadow wrenches itself free from Melisandre's womb.  King Stannis Baratheon then arrives at Renly's camp, along with the Red Priestess Melisandre and Ser Davos Seaworth in his retinue. Stannis has come to treat with Renly and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother. Renly, along with his Kingsguard members Brienne and Ser Loras Tyrell, counters that no one wants Stannis to be king. Renly also scoffs at Stannis's conversion to the religion of the Lord of Light. Catelyn Stark criticizes both brothers for acting like sulking children. Stannis counters that it is odd that Catelyn is standing alongside Renly, given that her own husband Ned Stark rejected Renly's initial plan to claim the throne and supported Stannis as Robert's rightful heir, even at the cost of his own life. In a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him, Stannis offers Renly that if he relinquishes his claim, Stannis will grant him his old seat on the small council, and even name him as his heir (unless Stannis ever has a son in the future). Catelyn reminds Stannis that their common enemy is the Lannisters, but he will not hear it, again asserting his right to the Iron Throne. Renly states that the 100,000 soldiers waving his banners makes him king, and Stannis's small army is hopelessly outnumbered. Stannis says that they shall see the next morning when their armies clash, and he departs. As she leaves Melisandre warns, \"Look to your sins Lord Renly, for the night is dark and full of terrors.\" Renly watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved Stannis once.  At King Stannis's command, Ser Davos rows Melisandre to some caves located near Renly's camp. Davos knows these caves from his old smuggling days. Melisandre asks him about whether he desires her, and his views on the conflict they are involved in between right and wrong, insisting that she is on the side of good. They find the way through the caves is blocked by metal bars. Melisandre takes off her cloak revealing that she is naked and heavily pregnant and promptly \"gives birth\" to a creature made entirely of shadow, as Ser Davos looks on in horror.  In Qarth Qarth2 The main gate of Qarth opens for Daenerys.  On the return of her bloodrider Kovarro, Daenerys receives word that the city of Qarth is nearby, and they are willing to receive the \"Mother of Dragons.\" Ser Jorah Mormont cautions that the desert surrounding Qarth is known as the \"Garden of Bones,\" as those who are turned away by Qarth perish outside the city walls due to exposure and thirst. Daenerys and her Khalasar leave the Red Waste and reach the city of Qarth. The Thirteen, a group of wealthy nobles and merchant princes, the leaders of Qarth, emerge to greet her, guarded by a group of shielded spearmen. One of the Thirteen, the Spice King, speaks for the group. They request that the \"Mother of Dragons\" present her children, but Daenerys insists that her people be fed and sheltered before she reveals her dragons. The Thirteen decide to turn Daenerys' group away and abandon them to the Garden of Bones. Daenerys swears vengeance on Qarth, with \"fire and blood,\" should they not comply. Jorah seems to find these threats rather reckless, but one of the Thirteen, Xaro Xhoan Daxos, chooses to vouch for Daenerys through Sumai, a blood oath by which a Qartheen may vouch for a visitor. Daenerys and her Khalasar are let into Qarth."], "review": null}, "14": {"id": "s02e05", "name": "The Ghost of Harrenhal", "script": "- You swear it? - By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne. Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty. And the wording of this oath? The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together. And in return for my son's loyalty? In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army. When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before. Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother. Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind. Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight. No! No. Follow me! - You'll die for this. - No, wait, it wasn't her! We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this. Now. I won't leave him. You can't avenge him if you're dead. Over there, go! Not that way. We need to go home. - Loras. My lord, my lady. Get out. Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king. And you want that privilege for yourself. You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis. There's no time for this. Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis. Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly. I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death? Stannis. I will put a sword through his righteous face. You can't stay here. He would have been a true king, a good king. Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world? Revenge. I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it. You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please. He was very handsome. He was, Your Grace. \"Your Grace. \" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen. Do you want to be a queen? No. I want to be the queen. Killed? By whom? Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way. Really? Who'd have thought? Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour. Whomever did it, I say well done. It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea. Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one. And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later. Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away? She'll be safer in Dorne. Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety. It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you. So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots? Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready. No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations. May I ask specifically what the king has in mind? You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same. It's important that we talk about this. It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors. It's wildfire. Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin? - No. - That's a lie right there. It is not a lie. Why would I lie? Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean. I'm telling you the truth. The smart money would be on more likely. She's making wildfire. But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours. The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned. I suppose there's only one way to find out. They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please. When did she tell you this? I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you. Swear to me on what? On my life. But I don't care about your life. In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out. Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me. Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion. It will be my pleasure. Your Grace. What is it? I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace. I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him. Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be. I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave. - I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter. Your Grace, I I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice. And I've never known you to hide from the truth. You've come to lecture me on truth? I've come to tell you that what I saw All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne. Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron I'll hear no more about it. Take a company of men, secure the perimeter. When do we sail for King's Landing? As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city. And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you? That's not your concern. If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers. I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong? Loyal service means telling hard truths. Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth? She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey. What do you believe? You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her. We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay. Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy. Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos. I've got it! I've got it! So it's that one there at the top, on the right. Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit. Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have? There's that mind of yours you keep going on about. Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it. Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father? He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it. Corruption. Yes! We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king. It's hard to argue with his assessment. Not after what he did to your birthday present. The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now. A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey. You have to admire his imagination. He's talking about you. What? Demon monkey? People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills. Blame me? I'm trying to save them. You don't need to convince me. Demon monkey. Yeah, come on. You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome. Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop! Where are we headed, Captain? The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do yourjobs well. And who decides if we've done ourjobs well? I do. Your captain. I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you? You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor. Stop. We yield. Congratulations on your first command. Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off. Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow. You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you. That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though Enjoy the Stony Shore. Come on, I'll take you out. Who are you? Dagmer, your first mate. Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh. They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself. And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages? You're not. And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander. They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like? The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square. The seat of the House of Tallhart, - What, you don't think we could take it? - No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then Take me to my ship. The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed. The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them. Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn. And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him? We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep. Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you. My wife's in Lannisport. Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head. If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go! Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl. Where are you from? Maidenpool, my lord. And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me. House Mooton, my lord. And what is their sigil? A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you? Good. One more time, where are you from? Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown. And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North? They call him the Young Wolf. And? They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed. And do you believe them? No, my lord. Anyone can be killed. Fetch that water. A girl says nothing. A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl. I was always a girl. And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them. You're one of them now. I should have let you burn. And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me? - I didn't have a choice. - You did. I did. And here we are. A man pays his debts. A man owes three. Three what? The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done. I can name anyone and you'll kill him? A man has said. The one who tortures everyone. A man needs a name. I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler. That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty. He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn. When will he come? The Halfhand does things in his own time. My uncle told me stories about him. Most of them are true. I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall. The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw. So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own. Well, possible for the Halfhand. Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here. There's nothing more sickening than a man in love. About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm. The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men. Before I die, please, stop talking. Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men? Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this. I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. Wildlings? One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts. So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes. And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times. But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know? - Well I read it in a book. Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand. Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah. Take care, my lord. I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, \"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. \" Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow. After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power. My companion takes issue. If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. - No offense meant. - Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor. To do what? The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy. How much do you have? If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father. My lord, this man is insulting. I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down. My friend remains unconvinced. He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived. Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks. We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both. This is a shit idea. I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me. He'll be able to feed himself from now on. Let him sleep, Doreah. Yes, Khaleesi. He loves you. I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one. Thank you, my friend. Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth. It is known. And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo. May he ride forever through the night lands. Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy. You would look like a real princess in Xaro's She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi. You are their guest. It would be rude not to. And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen. It sounds wonderful. The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself. Please excuse me for a moment. What are they doing? Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry. Or melt it. Very simple. We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it. Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave. Not even when we leave. Why not? Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more. My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built. It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men. That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be. Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration? Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once. Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons. My apologies. Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth. What is the House of the Undying? It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic. You watch over her. Do I know you? I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. Who are you? I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power. It looked like Stannis. To me it just looked like A shadow in the shape of a man. In the shape of Stannis. We should reach my son's camp tomorrow. Will you stay there long, my lady? Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long. I never knew my mother. I'm sorry. My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young. It's a bloody business. What comes after is even harder. Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady? You mean to kill Stannis. I swore a vow. But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe. I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled. Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely. I only held him that once as he was dying. He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well. I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis. When the time comes, I will not hold you back. Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new. I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new. And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night. We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board. My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours. Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark. - Good. - Hodor. - Hodor. - Ah! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege. Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north? Might be a raiding party led by the mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister. We have to help them. Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men. Do you need so many? If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need. Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here. So, what does it mean? Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time. I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven. Must not mean anything, then. You're lying. You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar. - You know what it means. - I never said I didn't. You didn't give me an honest answer. That's not the same as being a liar. Well, it's not far off. So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream? Something bad? Tell me, boy. I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them. The sea is hundreds of miles away. I know. - It's just a stupid dream. - I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again. Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall? They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall. There. Where? On that mountain. I don't see very well. A fire. There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor. How many wildlings have joined him? From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move. - Where? - Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us. You saying we should fall back to the Wall? Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. - And to do that - We need to get rid of those lookouts. It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba. Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin. I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger. I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that? He's the one? Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword. Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat. I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble. Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on. So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you? He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor, my friend. Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants. And what about what a woman wants? Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want? To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne. Why? Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home. You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki? I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it. Ah, a conqueror. And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you? No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo. So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious. What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why? I will show you why. The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key. And behind the door? And it can all be mine? All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies Enough to go home. All I have to do? Is marry me. That was a romantic proposal. I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses. See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead. If you cross the sea with an army you bought The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country. To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros. The usurper is dead. The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other. According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand? The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world. Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way. And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now. I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, - but you must - Do not speak to me like I'm a child. - I only want - What do you want? Tell me. - To see you on the Iron Throne. - Why? You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real. So what would you have me do, as my advisor? Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth. And how do I get the ship? I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain. I look forward to meeting him. Khaleesi. You should stand sideface. Sideface? Sideways. Why? Smaller target. Am I fighting someone? You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right. Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from. Go up the battlement. Move away. Stand back. He's dead.", "summary": ["Plot The end of the Baratheon rivalry drives Catelyn to flee and Littlefinger to act.

I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes. - Why? - To take the castle. - You went with Robb. - And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. - Where's Hodor? - I don't know. Find the halfwit. My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard. - Why? - So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me. - I won't. Yes, you will. I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out. The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say. Theon. Did you hate us the whole time? I've yielded Winterfell to Theon. Louder. Say Prince Theon. I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me. Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit. Farlen, you be silent. Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do. All of you should do as he commands. My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. - You are all his subjects. - Bugger that. I serve the Starks. - If you think you can hold the North with it - Shut up! If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, - I will be as good to you as he ever was. - Steady. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not? I am. I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens. My lord. My Lord Greyjoy. I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive. You were here the day I was taken. I'm the one who took you. What of it? Let me serve you. Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts. It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again. So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up. Step aside. Why? It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me. You'll all go about your tasks as usual. - And in a few days' time Greyjoy! We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword. Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes. It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. - These people are your people. - They are not my people. King Robb thought of you as a brother. My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you. Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons. Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home. If he were alive to see this He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine. I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand. You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll Take him to the cells. Lock him up My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay. I'll lock him in a cell until he rots. No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives. Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death! No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded. The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut. I urge you not to make a hasty decision. He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine. He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do. You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next. Come. No! - No! Theon! Rodrik! He who passes the sentence should swing the sword. I'm begging you. Coward. Stop. Stop! Stop right now! You don't give commands anymore, little lord. - Please, stop this. Please stop him. Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father. You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please. Any last words, old man? Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost. Theon, please don't. Do something! I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it! Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! There goes your pet. He's not a pet. No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing. - Ghost is different. - So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night. I thought you said you couldn't know wild things. I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark. We could do the same. No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it. My father always said I'm of the North. - I wasn't joking. - Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me? No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life. - I'll gladly give my life. - I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me? I do. You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us. Can you read? - My lord? Can you read? This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand. My apologies, my lord. I must have Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this My cupbearer can read better than you. To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance? My lord, I To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us. Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it. Lord Petyr Baelish. Mmm. Give us the room. Clear all this. - Lord Tywin. - Baelish. - Wine? - Thank you. What news from the capital? I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp. Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear. So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces. Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel. It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after. You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today? After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, - feeding horses and soldiers. - Yes, yes, yes. The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery Wants to be queen. Yes, she does. House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. - Against my grandson. - They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated. More wine for Lord Baelish. If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden? They have. Pardon, my lord. It's only wine. You would ride there yourself? Tonight, with your leave. I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl. And what else? On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark. Why? He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters. Hmm. - A girl. - A wildling. We could question her. You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking. - What's your name? - Ygritte. She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face. I gave you my name. I'm Jon Snow. You ought to burn them you killed. We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area? Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again. Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass? - The free folk. - How many? Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow. Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want? Do you mean to march on the Wall? Do you know who I am, girl? Qhorin Halfhand. Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner? They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow. We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. - It needs to be done. Want me to do it? No. No, I'll do it. Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now. You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us. I'm as much a crow as they are. Will you burn me? After? Can't. Someone might see the smoke. Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold. Go on. Be quick about it. Do it. Bastard, do it! You can't do it. We both know it. The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close. I'll find them. Call for them. Go on. Call loudly. May the Seven guide the princess on herjourney. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage. One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you. You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry. - I saw you cry. - Did you say something, my lady? My little brother cried when I left Winterfell. So? It seems a normal thing. Is your little brother a prince? No. Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog. Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace. Murderer! Bastard! All hail the King. He's no king. He's a bastard! Please, Your Grace, we're hungry. Freak. Get the Prince back to the Keep now. Yes, my lord. Come, quickly. Please, Your Grace, give us some food! Bread, Your Grace, please! Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me! Hold on! Hold them back! Just kill them! Kill them all! - Move. Move! Pull back! Tear him to pieces! What are you doing? I want these people executed! And they want the same for you. Where's Sansa? Through the door. Come on. Push hard. Protect the king! - Get back! - Fall back! Keep him safe! Brotherfucker! - Watch out. - Hold them back. Hey. Traitors! - I'll have all their heads. - You blind, bloody fool. You can't insult me. We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king. - You can't - I can, I am. They attacked me! They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool. All because of a war you started. You're talking to a king! And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? Let them have her. If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know. Where are you going? You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here. Take some men and go and find the Stark girl. I take my orders from the king. Where? This way. Please! No! No! Please! You're all right now, little bird. You're all right. We'll get you. We'll get you. This way. Are you hurt, my lady? The little bird's bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. - See to that cut. - Well done, Clegane. I didn't do it for you. He shouldn't make me wait. The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth. I already have a husband. Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery. The Mother of Dragons! Here he comes. Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself. Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself. Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square. Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want? My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have. I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships. I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne? My father sat there, before he was murdered. But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say \"take the Iron Throne\"? I didn't come here to argue grammar. Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. - Do you have an army? - Not yet. You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros? There are many there that support my claim. When were you there last? I left when I was a baby. So, in truth, you have no allies. The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return. Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me. Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met. A shrewd man. For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. Yes, my lady, but not with my ships. Who taught you to read? My father, my lord. Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he? A stonemason. A stonemason who could read? Hmm. He taught himself. Quite a man. What killed him? Loyalty. You're a sharp little thing, aren't you? Did Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions. No. But you've already begun. Did you know your father, my lord? I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old. He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold. I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord. Mmm. Where are you going, girl? The armory, my lord. - Why? - Lord Tywin sent me. What might this be? Lord Tywin gave it to me. What for? To take to the armory. Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him. Move! Get out of the way! Amory Lorch. A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done. Now! A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time. But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now. Guard! - Your Grace. - Your Grace. My honor, Your Grace. Your Grace. - Your Grace. - Quent. Lady Talisa. Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me. It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows. Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth? Because it's obvious. What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop? I'd call you a liar. Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty. I always thought I was a brilliant liar. Better at amputations, I'm afraid. Quite a pretty spot. Will we be here long? I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you. I'm not a spy. Of course, a spy would deny being a spy. You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. \"The young wolf is on the move. \" Perhaps you'd join me. If you've got time, of course, for, well Robb. Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very helpful. - Lady Talisa. - Lady Stark. Lady Talisa - Maegyr. - Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name. An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace. I've missed you. Yes, you look positively forlorn. You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today. I wish that you were free to follow your heart. I know. You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. - You are promised to another. - I know. A debt that must be paid. - I haven't forgotten. - Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell. Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go. We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. Here? There's no shelter here. There's no shelter anywhere. There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. - If you light a fire - No fire. - But a fire is - No fire. Have it your way. We'll stay warmer if we stay close. Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life. Think they're out looking for you? - Yes. - Think they'll find you? Yes. You're brave. Stupid, but brave. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. I'm just trying to get comfortable. Stop it! - You're still moving. - Was I? I didn't notice that time. This cannot be true. We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true. Why? Why would Theon Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores. - My brothers? - We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead. I told you, never trust a Greyjoy! I must go north at once. There's still a war to win, Your Grace. How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? - How can I ask men to follow me if I can't - You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself. Let me go and talk to Theon. There will be no talk. He will die for this. Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head. Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself. Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you? I'm no liar. All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone. I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord. How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand. There are other ways to serve, my lord. - I'm a prince now, and you'd do well - There are other ways to serve, my prince. Like what? We know things, the free people. You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt? Other things. Savage things. Wait outside. I always wondered what you had under there. It comes at a price. I'm not killing you. That's your price. I already had that. What do you want then, other than your miserable life? What all free people want. My freedom. Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well. - Ow! - Shh. - It's not deep. - I thought they were going to kill me. They thought so, too. He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me. - Of course he did. - Why? Why would a stranger You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead. I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them. Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you But you're not the wrong people. Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way. And where are you going? I have something for you from Prince Theon. - What? - Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm. The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets. Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi. Where are they? Where are my dragons?", "summary": ["Plot Theon completes his master stroke. In King's Landing, the Lannisters send Myrcella from harm's way in the nick of time. Arya comes face to face with a surprise visitor; Dany vows to take what is hers; Robb and Catelyn receive crucial news; Qhorin gives Jon a chance to prove himself.  Summary At Winterfell TheonApproachesBran Theon approaches Bran, then takes over Winterfell.  At Winterfell, Maester Luwin frantically sends off a messenger raven. A band of raiders from House Greyjoy, led by Theon Greyjoy, take over the undefended castle. Theon had lured the defenders away with a feint at Torrhen's Square and then infiltrated the castle using grappling claws. Theon tells Bran Stark to surrender the castle to him to save his people. Bran submits in front of his assembled people. Ser Rodrik Cassel is captured by Theon's men as he is returning from Torrhen's Square. He spits in Theon's face, and Dagmer Cleftjaw insists that Theon must kill him, or lose face in front of his ironborn raiders. Theon botches the beheading of Ser Rodrik, requiring several hacks and a kick, horrifying the people of Winterfell. Later that night, Osha the wildling woman has sex with Theon, but then sneaks out of his room while he is asleep. Osha frees Bran, Rickon Stark, Hodor, and their direwolves (Summer and Shaggydog). She smuggles them out of the castle and kills one of Theon's guards in the process.  In the Westerlands At King Robb Stark's army camp, Robb chats with Talisa, who has followed his forces on their campaign. Robb introduces Talisa to his mother Catelyn Stark, who has returned from the Stormlands along with Brienne of Tarth. They are interrupted when Lord Roose Bolton arrives with the terrible news sent by Luwin's last messenger raven. Furious at Theon's betrayal, Robb intends to march his army back to the North to repel the invasion. Roose advises that the few hundred soldiers left scattered in the North can be rallied by his bastard son, Ramsay Snow, who is in the North at the Dreadfort. They could overcome the small Ironborn invasion force. Roose warns that retreating the entire Northern army group would lose everything they have gained. Robb agrees, but insists that Bolton's men take Theon alive so Robb can look him in the eyes and ask \"Why?\" before personally executing him.  At Harrenhal At Harrenhal, the main base camp for the House Lannister army in the Riverlands, Tywin Lannister berates Ser Amory Lorch for delivering a letter to their enemies instead of their allies, because he cannot read properly. He discovers that his cupbearer \"Arry\" (secretly Arya Stark) can read. Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish arrives at camp and meets with Tywin. Arya tries to hide her face to prevent Littlefinger from identifying her. Baelish discusses the assassination of Renly Baratheon and the subsequent rallying of the noble Houses from the Stormlands under the banner of his older brother Stannis Baratheon. However, House Tyrell of the Reach has retreated its large army back to their capital at Highgarden, and has not joined Stannis. Baelish discusses with Tywin the possibility of forming an alliance between House Lannister and House Tyrell.  Later, Tywin questions Arya about her origins. While Tywin is distracted, Arya sees that a letter on his table is about her older brother Robb Stark, so she snatches it. After she asks Tywin about his own father, Tywin sends her to fetch more firewood. She takes this opportunity to read the letter, but unfortunately bumps into Amory Lorch who sees that she is carrying the letter and grows suspicious. Arya runs away and Amory heads to tell Tywin. Arya runs to find Jaqen H'ghar, telling him that Amory Lorch is the second name he owes her, and it must be now. Just as Amory Lorch reaches Tywin's quarters, he falls down dead with a poisoned dart lodged in his neck.  In King's Landing The royal court including King Joffrey Baratheon, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, Prince Tommen Baratheon, and Sansa Stark are at the docks seeing off Princess Myrcella Baratheon as she departs in a ship bound for Dorne. Cersei is heartbroken and warns Tyrion that she will not forgive him for sending away her only daughter.  As per Tyrion's plans, Myrcella will stay in Dorne with House Martell until she comes of age to fulfill the marriage alliance to their youngest son, Trystane Martell. The High Septon of the Faith of the Seven offers a blessing for her departure. The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the War of the Five Kings, as Cersei ignored both Tyrion and Janos Slynt's earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving peasants or there would be mounting discontent with her son's rule. JoffreyAttackedSeason2 Joffrey has excrement thrown on him by rioting peasants.   As the royal party travels back to the Red Keep through the crowded streets, the starving refugees and commoners of King's Landing plead for bread and hurl insults at King Joffrey, and ultimately, someone throws cow excrement into Joffrey's face. Despite being accompanied by only a few dozen guards facing hundreds of peasants, Joffrey impetuously orders his soldiers to kill the entire crowd. SansaAlmostRapedSeason2 Sansa is almost raped.  A riot subsequently erupts and spreads throughout the city. The royal party's guards are soon overwhelmed, and Joffrey, Cersei and Tyrion barely make it back to the castle unscathed. The High Septon is literally torn apart by the mob.  Tyrion is enraged by Joffrey's shocking stupidity, for massively overreacting to having cow dung thrown at him, and for not realizing that his orders would cause a riot among the starving peasants and endanger the entire royal party. Joffrey, still manically cursing the mob and demanding they all be killed, shrieks that Tyrion cannot speak to him in that way and petulantly reminds his uncle that he is talking to a king. Tyrion then contemptuously slaps his nephew across the face, sarcastically asking if his hand fell from his wrist, but Joffrey does not retaliate. The scant two thousand City Watch guards have difficulty containing the riot, and chaos reigns throughout the city. Tyrion realizes to his horror that Sansa Stark was lost in the crowd. Joffrey petulantly refuses to send his men after her, even after Tyrion points out her importance as a hostage or the fact that if any harm comes to her, the Starks may retaliate by executing his uncle Jaime. Outside, Sansa is dragged away by a mob of angry men and is about to be raped, when Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane arrives and slays her assailants. He carries Sansa to the castle and orders handmaids to take care of her. Tyrion thanks him for saving Sansa's life, but Sandor bluntly responds that he didn't do it for him.  Beyond the Wall YgritteSeason2 Jon first lays eyes on Ygritte.  The scouting party of the Night's Watch led by Qhorin Halfhand has left the expeditionary base, their main force set up at the Fist of the First Men, and continues searching for the wildlings in the Frostfangs mountain range. They encounter a small group of wildling scouts and engage them in combat, killing all except one: a red-haired young woman named Ygritte. Qhorin orders Jon Snow to execute her while the rest of them continue on up the mountain. Jon hesitates, giving Ygritte enough time to make a run for it. Jon pursues and captures Ygritte, but they have become separated from Qhorin's scouting party. With darkness falling, Jon and his prisoner have to settle in for the night, hoping to link back up with Qhorin when daylight returns.  In Qarth DanyDiscoversDeadPeopleSeason2 Daenerys discovers that her guards have been slain and her dragons are missing.  In Qarth, Daenerys Targaryen tries to negotiate with the Spice King for ships to return to Westeros. However, he considers it to be too risky an investment \u2013 considering that she has no army and has no open supporters in Westeros \u2013 and she receives nothing. Returning with Xaro Xhoan Daxos to his mansion, Daenerys finds her guards dead, Irri strangled to death, and her dragons missing. A hooded figure carries the dragons in a covered box up steps towards a tower."], "review": null}, "16": {"id": "s02e07", "name": "A Man Without Honor", "script": "A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you? The giant must have took him. The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one? Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking. Right. Get the horses and the hounds. Come on, find the scent. Where they going? Halt! Enjoying your first hunt? So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord. With hunting, there's blood at the end. They're little boys. I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them. Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead. They have no value to me missing. Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now. Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said We have a scent! The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game. We should have took more food. We couldn't risk going to the kitchens. Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed. And if Theon found out, he'd hang them. - The boy can't survive on walnuts. - I'm fine. We've been walking since before sunrise. - Even Hodor will tire. - Hodor. - Even you, sweet giant. - Hodor. Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there. Jack and Billy. - They'll give us some food. - We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are. Billy climbs a tree better than anyone. You've never seen me climb a tree, little man. They'll be after us with hounds. We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever. Did you pull a knife on me in the night? What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse. Let's move. It is the first time. How old are you, boy? I'm a man of the Night's Watch. You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets Don't call them that. What, stones? Or bone? Neither. Both. Move! I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows? There are no women of the Night's Watch, no. So the lads just do it with each other? No. - Never? - Never. We swore an oath. You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable. - Would you please shut up? - Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. - I'm a free woman. - You're a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman. If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what \"prisoner\" means. And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl. It was my choice to say the words. - So you don't like girls? - Of course I like girls. But you chose never to touch them. That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch. So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy! They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours. My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours. So why are you fighting us? Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up. Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin. We hanged 20 men last night. I don't care if you hanged 100. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head. We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners. Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one. Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence. Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side. Mmm. Is that mutton? Yes, my lord. Don't like mutton. - I'll bring something else. - Leave it. - Are you hungry? - No. Of course you are. Eat. I'll eat in the kitchen later. It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer. Sit. Eat. You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life. I eat a lot. I just don't grow. Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose. Have you ever lost before? Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war? But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months. Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built. The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had 35 hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened? Dragons? Yes. Dragons happened. Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name Aegon and his sisters. Mmm? It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too. Correct. A student of history, are you? Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar. I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy. Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister. Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it? Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair? Most girls are idiots. You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword? From my father. He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason. Have you met many stonemasons, my lord? Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want. And, girl. \"M'lord. \" Lowborn girls say \"m'lord,\" not \"my lord. \" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly. My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly. You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that? Yes. Go on. I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. - You were so brave. - Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats. Does it give you joy to scare people? No, it gives me joy to kill people. Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man. It was his duty. He never liked it. Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is. Why are you always so hateful? You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king. I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did. You are one of the Thirteen. If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. - They mean nothing to me on their own. - Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world. Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back. There is no we, so why would you help me get them back? I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof. But it did happen under your roof. Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been I don't care where you've been. You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was. No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall. We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night. You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you. Walk. I could teach you how to do it. I know how to do it. You know nothing, Jon Snow. And what did she say? She admired your spirit, Your Grace. And what then? She If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang. She tore the paper in half, Your Grace. You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper. Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork. Too many prisoners. Is there room for Ser Alton? Does he need to lie down? Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them. Torrhen. That will be all. Your Grace. A minute of your time? I've been treating your wounded men. And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning. They're not my enemies. That's what I tell my bannermen. I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses. But some are not. I need silk for stitching. I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over. - If you need help finding these - I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you. Continue, my lady. You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender? Yes. The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need. I expect he will. If I could write a list. Come with me to the Crag. I don't think that will be Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men. Children, come inside, quick. Come on. Hurry up! Can't find anything, ser. - They've lost the scent. - Try again. We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them. We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord. I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak. Prince Theon. - Where are they? - Who, m'lord? The Stark boys. Where are they? I don't know. I seen no one. Think harder. I swear, m'lord. I don't know. My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for. Send the old man home. Go back to Winterfell. Take him back. Theon, don't do this. - You came back. - As soon as I heard. Do you know anything? - Irri is dead. - I know. - She was a good - She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her. Doreah? We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse. I should have been here. You went to find me a ship. My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people. \"These people\"? They are not to be trusted. And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse. Your people are in Westeros. The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive. - They will soon enough. - And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool. You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi. There it is. \"Trust me. \" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it. - You are too young to be so - And you are too familiar. Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how. Find my dragons. How long till we get back to your crows? We're close. What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? - Do you even know where they are? - We're close. What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me? Nothing happened between you and me. \"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, \"we were only close together for warmth. \"And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. \"I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. \"And before I knew what was where, his his \"Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. \"And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! \"And he spread me legs and ruined. \"The shame of it. \"Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. \"What will me poor savage father say?\" Turn back around. \"And I thought that we were done, but he said, \"'Turn back around. \"' I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just What, right here in the muck? I'll keep you warm enough. Are you that afraid of it? That's enough. It's nice and wet and warm. Enough! It don't have teeth. All right! All right. Gods, you're dull. Should have took me while you had the chance. No, no! No. Oh, no. It's all right. Give me that. If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now. Help me flip it over. - Where are you going? - To tell Her Grace. You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand? Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more. My mother told me, but I thought it would be different. In what way? I thought it would be less Less messy. Wait until you birth a child. You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means? I'm fit to bear children for the king? A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen. Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood. His Grace was not with you? Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion. You may never love the king, but you will love his children. I love His Grace with all my heart. That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice. But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace? You can try, little dove. Who did you say your mother was again? Cinda Lannister. Is she the fat one? Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it. I squired for you once, you know. When? The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding. I went to Willem Frey's wedding? You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up. He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name? Bryan. Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before. That's right. I ran up and volunteered. \"Let me, my lord. Let me. \" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family. You didn't, though. You really remember? You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them. - When I think back to that day - Shh! You were saying? I Never mind. It's embarrassing. More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit? I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about. I understand completely. How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you. It's just that I I was 16 once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice. Which knight was it? Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time. What was he like? He was A painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you. It's hard to put into words. It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life. Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison. - Did you squire for him again? - No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire. It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint. And have you thought about Of course. Every day. And? Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful. But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now. What is it? - It's actually quite simple. - Well, let me help you. You'll only have to do one thing. Tell me. You'll have to die. Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection. I didn't come here for lessons. No, you came for the dragons. You have them? Where are they? Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons. You love her. Where are the dragons? Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal? Will you betray her again? Never. The thief you seek is with her now. I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief. No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us? Please, they're my children. I'm begging you. Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us. Without me, the dragons will die. It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you. You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. - I will help you, Khaleesi. - How? I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them. You have my dragons? When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me. But there is no King of Qarth. There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement. You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me. Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king. An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise. The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever. A mother should be with her children. Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them. - Lady Stark! - No farther. Keep your hands off me, woman. Don't enter without an invitation, man. Forgive me. Lady Stark. What is it? - They caught the Kingslayer. Kingslayer! - Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him! - Hang him! You'll die today. Justice for the Karstark. Gut him! Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death. Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner. This monster killed my son. And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here. I will have his head. And if you try and stop me You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king! - And where is our king now? - You know very well. He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. - He brought that foreign bitch with him. - How dare you! - Threatening my lady is an act of treason. - Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters? I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down. When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head. Wise men do not make demands of kings. Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head. Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find! You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you. And gag him! Since when do you light your own candles? Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant. How many times can you read one raven scroll? Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships. - More than we have. - Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind. We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above. \"Rain fire on them from above. \" You're quoting Father, aren't you? Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he? Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. I'm sure you'll make a point eventually. He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse. I thought the girls might help him. - Did you? - I was wrong. If we can't control him Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me. It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head. I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light. The boy is more Robert than Jaime. Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins. Sins? The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? \"Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin. \" You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them. Then why wait? We're sworn to the king. - There's not a king. - That's treason. So is saving Lannisters, yeah? - Back off, you. - No, I won't. Your son returns at dawn, my lady? So they say. The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister? Come. He'll not be making it through the night. I need to be alone with him. - My lady, our orders - Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him. Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman? Do you hear them out there? They want your head. Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me. You strangled his son with your chains. Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. - Any knight would have done the same. - You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took. So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast? She is a truer knight than you will ever be, - Kingslayer. - Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back. You are a man without honor. Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered? - Brienne. - No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman. Your sword. I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not. What are you doing? What have you done? If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question. No!", "summary": ["Plot Jaime meets a distant relative; Dany receives an invitation to the House of the Undying; Theon leads a search party; Jon loses his way in the wilderness; Cersei counsels Sansa.  Summary At Winterfell Burned bodies Theon has the burned bodies raised on the walls of Winterfell  At Winterfell, now held by the ironborn, Theon Greyjoy awakens to find that Osha is gone and she has escaped with Hodor, Bran Stark, Rickon Stark and their direwolves. Theon berates Lorren for allowing them to escape. When Lorren counters that Theon is also to blame for sleeping with Osha and letting his guard down, Theon furiously beats him. Theon leads the ironborn on horseback to hunt down the boys with hounds to track them. The search leads them to a shepherd's farm, but the farmer says that he hasn't seen anyone. Dagmer finds some walnut shells, so they know that Bran and Rickon were there, but the hounds can't get the scent. Theon tells them the hunt is over and to return Maester Luwin to Winterfell: he knows where they are, and his mercy has been exhausted.  Theon returns to Winterfell. He announces that he is going to show them what happens to those who are not loyal to him: he hoists two bodies of small children, burned black and beyond recognition, to either side of the main gate. Seeing them, Maester Luwin cries out in grief and anguish, believing Bran and Rickon have been killed.  At Harrenhal At Harrenhal, Tywin Lannister is discussing the assassination of Amory Lorch with Ser Gregor Clegane. Tywin is convinced that it was an assassination attempt on himself, unaware that Jaqen H'ghar actually killed Lorch on the request of Arya Stark. Ser Gregor speculates that the Brotherhood Without Banners may have been responsible. Enraged, Tywin orders Gregor to burn out villages and farms in reprisal for this assassination attempt. Tywin later suspects that Arya is highborn, because she doesn't pronounce \"m'lord\" the way commoners do and says \"my lord\" instead, possessing an educated vocabulary. Arya makes the excuse that her mother, whom she said was a handmaiden for years to royalty, had taught her to speak properly like them.  In King's Landing In King's Landing, Sansa Stark comes to thank Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane for saving her life during the recent riot in the city and says that he was very brave. Sandor simply says that a dog doesn't need courage to fight off rats. Sansa is perturbed by his \"hateful speech,\" but Sandor cautions that a day will come when his penchant for violence is all that stands between her and her \"beloved\" King Joffrey.  Caught Sansa and Shae trying to flip the mattress.  Sansa awakens in her bed from a nightmare, only to find the sheets covered in blood because she has had her first period. As she will be expected to marry and conceive a son with Joffrey when she begins menstruating, Sansa panics and frantically tries to get rid of the bloody sheets to remove the evidence. Shae tries to help Sansa hide the sheets but Sandor finds them.  Sansa and Cersei Sansa and Cersei discuss Sansa's womanhood.  Terrified of being brought to Joffrey, Sansa is instead brought before Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, who in her own way tries to comfort her. Cersei reveals that King Robert Baratheon had abandoned her to hunt as she birthed each of her children, but that her brother Jaime Lannister insisted on being by her side the whole time, noting that Sansa should never expect such devotion from Joffrey. Cersei says that while Sansa will never love Joffrey, she will love their children and advises Sansa to love no one but her children \u2014 whom a mother can't help but love \u2014 because \"the more people you love, the weaker you are.\" When Sansa asks if she should not love Joffrey, Cersei only answers, \"You can try, little dove.\"   Privately, Cersei meets with Tyrion and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime. She wonders if Joffrey's violent personality is the price of her and Jaime's sins. Tyrion earnestly points out that her other two children, Myrcella and Tommen, are good and decent children. Cersei and Tyrion share an odd moment of sympathy.  In the Westerlands Alton&#039;s body Torrhen Karstark discovers the body of Alton Lannister.  At King Robb Stark's army camp in the Westerlands, close to an unidentified keep, Alton Lannister returns as an envoy giving Queen Cersei's response to Robb's peace terms. Robb is unsurprised that she rejected them and imprisons Alton with his cousin Jaime Lannister. The nurse Talisa Maegyr discusses medical supplies she needs with Robb. Robb suggests she accompany him to the Crag to acquire the supplies she needs. That night, Jaime kills Alton to lure the guard, Torrhen Karstark, into his cell. Jaime strangles Torrhen and escapes but is soon recaptured. Torrhen was the son of Lord Rickard Karstark, one of the major nobles from the North. Lord Rickard demands Jaime's execution in revenge, regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage. Catelyn is forced to argue for Jaime's life. Catelyn confronts Jaime and tells him that he has no honor. Jaime bitterly explains that his vows as a knight required him to defend the innocent and serve the king, but his king was slaughtering the innocent. Jaime considers concepts like \"honor\" and \"loyalty\" na\u00efve at best and hypocritical at worst. Jaime asserts that he has only been with Cersei and begins to ridicule Eddard Stark, Catelyn's late husband, by bringing up the shame of Eddard fathering an illegitimate child with another woman. This brings Catelyn to breaking point and she asks for Brienne's sword.  Beyond the Wall Jon Snow is still separated from the Night's Watch scouting group led by Qhorin Halfhand. He attempts to locate them, traveling with his wildling prisoner Ygritte. She and Jon argue about freedom, his oaths, and who is invading whose lands. Jon tells Ygritte his father was Ned Stark and as Northman, he has the blood of the First Men just like she does, to which Ygritte asks Jon why the Watch fights the wildlings. She states that the animosity of the southerners toward the Wildlings is arbitrary, given that the Wildlings are only distinguished from them by living north of the Wall when it was constructed. She mocks Jon's sexual inexperience, surmising that he is a virgin. She taunts him by offering to teach him how to have sex. She escapes and leads him into an ambush. Ygritte says that Jon should have taken her when he had the chance.  In Qarth The Thirteen 2x07 Daenerys asks The Thirteen for help.  Daenerys Targaryen is desperate to find her stolen dragons. Ser Jorah Mormont returns and she orders him to find them. Xaro Xhoan Daxos claims to be distressed at breaking his promise to protect her, fearing that his word will be publicly seen as worthless. Jorah questions Quaithe of Asshai. Quaithe knows that Jorah once betrayed Daenerys by spying on her. Quaithe warns Jorah that the man who stole the dragons is already with Daenerys. Jorah finds Daenerys, in the company of Kovarro, pleading with the council of The Thirteen to find her dragons. The warlock Pyat Pree confesses to stealing the dragons and declares Xaro the King of Qarth. Doubles of the warlock then magically appear behind the other members of the Thirteen and slit their throats, leaving only Pyat Pree and Xaro. Xaro secretly entered into an alliance with Pyat Pree to become king. Pyat Pree urges Daenerys to find her dragons at the House of the Undying as the three flee.

Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell. - Envy isn't attractive. - What envy? You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men. You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old? I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery. You treated them with honor? By butchering them? Before I had to kill them, - I treated them - You seized their home, as is your right. We're ironborn, we take what we need. Exactly. Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery. - They made me a promise - Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive? - Don't call me - A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were? If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak. You are weak. And you're stupid. I'm warning you. Go on, then. Warn me. You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot? You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word. Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North. Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. - When Robb Stark finds out - He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell. Leave us. Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone. I don't intend to die. You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea. I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones. I already got one crow. Don't need two. Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning. The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him. He could have killed me half a dozen times. And now he wishes he did. Gut him. He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son. Mance will want him. What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard? I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself. He runs, I'll chop his balls off. He runs, I'll do it meself. We're even now, Jon Snow. I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't I know. The others? When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you. They died because of me. See that it wasn't for nothing. All right, up, lad. Come on, on your feet, now. Move it. Is she beautiful? I've never met her. What's her name? Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name. I'm sure you'll be very happy. And you're marrying her for a bridge? - An important bridge. - Ah. It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge. When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father. He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me. He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, \"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?\" \"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" he told me. I wish I could have met him. He would have liked you. Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors. - He didn't care much about gold or glory. - And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. - I want the men following me to go home. - Then why don't you? Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice. - Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean. - That would be a start. Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night. How? Tell me this isn't true. Why? For the girls. - You betrayed me. - Robb No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway. Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free. I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell. - I grieve for your sons, my lord. - I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me. Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine. Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. - Make sure she's guarded day and night. - Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer? Forty, Your Grace. Send another 40 with our fastest horses. Robb. Damn. You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin. A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity. Brienne of Tarth. Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another. Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah. I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me. Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer. Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you? You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent. Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly? You will not provoke me to anger. I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight? I've never seen you fight. The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them. All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust. If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens. Do you take me for an idiot? In! I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid. Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer. King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety. Surrender the Iron Throne? Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all. No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep. The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north ofAshemark. Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner. Too close to Casterly Rock. He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force. He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid. We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work. You've got some questions to answer. Who killed Ser Amory? I don't know! Please! Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows. I told you, I don't know. Please. Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl. Where's Jaqen? Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it. Come on, time to kill some wolves. You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust. Where's Jaqen? - How would I know? - I need him now. - Lord Tywin's marching tonight. - You need him? He's helping me. I saw him. - Where? - Where? Where? - Ow! They went riding out the gates a few hours ago. On patrol. Let go of my ears. What do you want with him anyway? Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it. - They'll never trust me. - They might. - If you do what needs to be done. - What? How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl? - I didn't. - I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard. He's not yours to kill, crow. Do you have to do that here? I like to keep me hands clean. Yes, but do you have to do it here? You should start wearing the gold cloak. I don't want to wear a gold cloak. You're commander of the City Watch. - You shouldn't be dressed like a common - A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night. Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out. We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it. Fine, fine. No gold cloak. What? - What? - What? What? Why are you staring at me? You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here? To help me plan the defense of King's Landing. Stannis will be here any day. And one of these explains how to beat him? \"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. \" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh. Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers. My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery? I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery? Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves. For questioning? No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now. - We talked about this. - Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other. The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town. Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted. Ah. \"The Great Sieges of Westeros. \" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer. Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land. And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan? We could throw books at his men. We don't have that many books. We don't have that many men, either. What do we have? Pig shit. I'm not cut out for this sort of work. I always imagined meself doing something much worse. We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse. You lack imagination. Where do you think Jon is right now? He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead. He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter. Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you. He's got a Valyrian steel sword. So did his father. And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive. Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time. What in seven hells is that? The First Men made these marks. Help me with it. Look. If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it. That's a Night's Watch cloak. It's been here a long time. Oh. Must be dragonglass. Dragonglass? The maesters call it obsidian. Why would a brother hide it here? I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it. Mind where you're going. I'm sorry. I'll Where were you? A man has patrol duty. Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone. A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name. How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone? A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not. He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now. This a man cannot do. You promised you'd help me. Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name. And you'll kill them? Anybody? By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it. All right. Jaqen H'ghar. A girl gives a man his own name? - That's right. - Gods are not mocked. - This is no joking thing. - I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself. Un-name me. - No. - Please? I'll un-name you. - Thank you. - If you help me and my friends escape. This would require more than one life. - This is not part of our bargain. - Fine, Jaqen H'ghar. A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey. A girl will obey. A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight. Thank you, Podrick. Odd little boy. I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys. You and Varys both. Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel. He's only a boy. Younger boys are off fighting his war. - He's not ready. - What is he, 17? - Remember Jaime at 17? - Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield. It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us. Do you think I'm an idiot? No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence. You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die. He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert? Do you know why Varys is so dangerous? Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it. Because he doesn't have a cock. Neither do you. Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking. It's not that little. Why are you smiling? Because I'm happy. And why are you happy? Because I have your little whore. I thought you preferred blondes. Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased. Why do you care who I fuck? Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed. This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. - You need me. - For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time. Where did you find her? Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully. You've forgotten the most important thing about whores. Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me. You don't buy them, you only rent them. You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt. And how do I know you haven't killed her already? Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore. I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave. I promise I will free you. Don't forget me. Never. I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid. Get out. Shae! I've been waiting all night. What is wrong? You're beautiful. Then why do you look sad? We have to be more careful. Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself. There are people who want to hurt me. I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will. I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine. I'm yours. Promise me. I'm yours, and you are mine. Still no word? We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. - Once he captures the castle - Theon has my brothers. - If we storm the castle - He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head. Send word to your son. Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes. A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs. I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer. Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace. My lady. How are you? How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north. I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry. No. Forgive me. You're being kind. - I have no right. - You have every right. You're a king. That's not the kind of king I want to be. What kind do you want to be? I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell. I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry. I'd like to hear you play the harp. No. No, you would not. How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet? When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on. I don't want to marry the Frey girl. I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge. The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready. Shut up. Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven. Shut up. What did you bring? The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages. What did he want us to do about those guards? He didn't say. He just said, \"Walk through the gates. \" What about the guards? He didn't say anything about the guards. What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think? We have to trust him. Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran. - I want to go back to the kitchens. - Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid. Arry, don't. Away! Reset! If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day. Will it hold? Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace. Again, pull! I admire you, Ser Davos. I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag. My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me. Do you? Why? - My father was a crabber. - And? Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink. And where were those lords when Storm's End starved? Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King. You defend these men who insult you behind your back. Some are happy to do it to my face. We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with 500 men. - No one has forgotten, Your Grace. - No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life. - He was only a boy. - Then why'd he give him Storm's End? First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions. And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe. Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night. I was relieved they did not. Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand. Your Grace, I pray I serve you well. I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge. You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything. No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell. The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike. To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way? If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him. A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you. They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear. Imagine Stannis' terror. I am trying. You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man. Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you. I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men. I wish we could, too. What do you want? Tell me. If we're going to play, you'll have to start. My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of 19. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock. A most highborn plumber. The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. - You enjoy the game. - I do. Last thing I expected. And you play it well. I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over. They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light. The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine? In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats. We should sail there immediately. This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives. A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems. She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide. One game at a time, my friend. Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow. Astapor? We cannot stay here. They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children. They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die. You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there. You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve. Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there. That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. - His magic is strong. - And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember? Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face. They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them. We should bury them. I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message. If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer. - What's this? - Gold for the farmer. For his trouble. His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now. His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him. Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look. You're right so far. Who was that out there hung up at the gates? Must have been the farmer's boys. He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords? They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself. They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.", "summary": ["Plot At Winterfell, Theon receives a visitor and holds down the fort. Arya calls in her final debt with Jaqen in a way that displeases him.

Summary Beyond the Wall Dragonglass The Night's Watch find hidden dragonglass.  Ygritte brings Jon Snow before the Lord of Bones, who orders him executed, because he has already captured Qhorin Halfhand and doesn't need two \"crows\" for questioning. Ygritte convinces him to spare Jon because of his Stark blood. Qhorin initiates a plan to install Jon as a spy within the wildling ranks.  Grenn and Samwell Tarly discover a cache of dragonglass weapons at the Fist of the First Men. Jon's absence has been noted, but Sam refuses to believe that he is dead.  In Qarth Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys Targaryen to leave her dragons and flee Qarth, as he has recently booked passage to Astapor. She insists on attempting to reclaim them and asks Ser Jorah to lead her to the House of the Undying, without knowing what lies in wait.   At Winterfell Theon and Dagmer Theon gives Dagmer a pouch of gold to compensate for the killing of the orphans.  Yara Greyjoy arrives at Winterfell with a small band of men, but instead of bringing reinforcements she offers Theon only advice. Winterfell is too far from the sea, they can't successfully defend it with so few soldiers, and the North is rising against him. She implores Theon to abandon the castle and return home with her, but he refuses to give up his prize. Dagmer tells Theon that after killing the orphans, he also murdered the farmer and his wife.  Bran and Rickon Alive Bran overhears Luwin and Osha.  Luwin spots Osha sneaking into the catacombs. He follows her inside, and she explains that after reaching the farm she doubled back, using a stream to mask their scent from the hounds. Luwin urges her not to tell Bran and Rickon about the children Theon had murdered, but Bran is sitting up behind a corner and listening to them.  In the Narrow Sea Stannis Baratheon's fleet is closing in on King's Landing. Stannis tells Davos that he admires him and offers him the Hand of the King role once he takes the throne.  In King's Landing Ros1 Ros is revealed to have been captured by Cersei.  Tyrion Lannister scours history books seeking inspiration for his plans to defend the city. He takes advice from Bronn and Varys and implies that he has decided to make use of the stocks of wildfire. King Joffrey Baratheon is full of bravado, but his mother is worried about letting him fight. She tries to ensure his safety by kidnapping the prostitute Ros, believing that she is Tyrion's lover, to hold as collateral. Tyrion hides his relief that Shae is safe and ardently vows revenge against his sister.  At Harrenhal Jaqen H&#039;ghar 2x8 1 Arya gives Jaqen his own name  Lord Tywin Lannister is torn between needing to defend King's Landing and wanting to drive King Robb Stark from the Westerlands. His brother Kevan warns that Stannis will execute Cersei and Joffrey after capturing the capital. Tywin decides to march west, leaving Arya Stark at Harrenhal to serve his castellan, Ser Gregor Clegane. Realizing that she has missed her chance to kill Tywin, Arya pressures the assassin Jaqen H'ghar into aiding her escape from Harrenhal. She forces him to help her by giving him his own name as the third death he promised. She will only revoke his name when he agrees to break her and her friends out of the fortress. Arya, Hot Pie, and Gendry walk through the gates at midnight, as Jaqen instructed. They escape Harrenhal, realizing that the guards have been killed.  In the Westerlands Robb is furious when he learns that his mother Catelyn Stark has freed his prized captive Ser Jaime Lannister. He tells her that she has betrayed him and orders her kept under guard. Catelyn has sent Brienne of Tarth to escort Jaime to King's Landing to exchange him for her daughters, Sansa and Arya. Brienne uses a canoe to evade pursuit.

The tide's against us. Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates. You're coming home. King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them. This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain. Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment. Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand. - Gods be good. - God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us. - But not over them? - Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike. Well, first, we have to put it there. Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1. Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire. I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain. Are you afraid, my lion? If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid. I won't let them hurt you. I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war. It is now. You can't fuck your way out of everything. I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth. As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war. Your words are always wise and measured. - If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King You brought me something? Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however I know what ten drops will bring. Your Grace, if I may ask You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon. Yes. A siege is very Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many. Your Grace. And so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o'er his halls With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls And not a soul to hear - Good boys! - Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song? Drunk Lannisters. You've got a pretty voice. Thank you very much. And I like your nose. How many times you break it? Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. - My mam smacked me with an iron poker. - Oh. It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest. Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time Eh, you don't want to know about the third time. Poor nose. Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through. Welcome, friends. This round's on me. I don't think he likes me. You think you're a hard man? I know it. It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company. Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me. Only smaller. And quicker. Eh? Your Lord Imp's going to miss you. Aye I expect he will someday. Here we are. One more drink before the war? Shall we? I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege. - A wedding. - Exactly. Podrick, is that it? \"Is that it?\" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town. I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting. I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting. Do you trust him? Oddly enough, I do. Good. The map you asked for. There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city. Closer to 50. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary. I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her. That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord. Well, I'm not. For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai. What of it? You don't believe in the old powers, my lord? Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think? I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me. Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself. And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut. No, I don't believe you have. One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him. They're welcoming the new king. I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. - Drums. - Drums! Remember, wait till the ships The ships are in the bay. - They must be far enough in - I know what \"in\" means. - Do you know how to use that? - I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood. I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax. - Don't get killed. - Nor you, my friend. - Oh, are we friends now? - Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship. Enhances it, really. Oh! \"Enhances. \" Fancy word for a sellsword. Been spending time with fancy folks. Lady Sansa and Sheila. - Shae. - Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast. She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off. Sansa. Always been a great romantic, my nephew. Sansa, come here. I will pray for your safe return, my lord. - Will you? - Just as I pray for the king's. Stay safe, my lady. And you, my lion. Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss. My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it. You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood. Will you slay him yourself? If Stannis is fool enough to come near me. So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard? A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender. Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too. Some of those boys will never come back. Joffrey will. - The worst ones always live. - Shh. Come, my lady. Where's our fleet? On the way. Why isn't it here now? They're coming. Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question. The king has asked you a question. Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy. The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought. That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet. Where are their ships? It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise. Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here. If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied. Maybe. I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me. Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else. I doubt it. Maybe she's jealous of you. Why would she be jealous? Sansa. I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming? Yes. Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine. I'm not thirsty, Your Grace. So? I didn't offer you water. What's he doing here? Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him. But we have guards to defend us. Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors. The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups. The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning. The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen. You said he was here to protect us. He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine. There they are. - Archers to their marks. - Archers, to your marks! Archers! Nock your arrows! Nock arrows! - Hold fast. Hold fast! What are you doing? We need to attack them. - Hold fast. Boulders ready! Hold fast! There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them? There's only one ship. Archers, stand to! Man the below! - Nock. Nock and set! Draw! Hold. Hold. There's no one on board. More rocks coming up! Hold. Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear! Matthos! Get down! - Prepare to land. - Your Grace. The dwarf has played his little trick. - The wildfire. - He can only play it once. We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers Hundreds will die. Thousands. Come with me and take this city! Sansa, come here, little dove. My queen. What are you doing? Praying. You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for? For the gods to have mercy on us all. Oh. On all of us? - Yes, Your Grace. - Even me? Of course, Your Grace. Even Joffrey? - Joffrey is my - Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four. Your father doesn't believe in the gods? He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much. One for her. Here. Sit. Drink. Not like that. Drink, girl. I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens. They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here. It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits. And if the city should fall? You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse. Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink. Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten. More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull! He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon. They're coming. They're coming ashore. Rain fire on them. Archers! There are too many. Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now. Yes, my lord. Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too. Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts. Pull, pull! Go! Nock! Draw! - Draw! - Draw! Kill the Lannisters! - Loose! - Loose! - Draw! - Draw! - Loose! - Loose! To the Mud Gate, go now! First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate! Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse. CERSEl: When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired. You were Robert's queen. And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one. Pretty. That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend. Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service? A few weeks, Your Grace. When did you leave Lorath? I had a Lorathi handmaiden once. But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros? Ten years ago, Your Grace. From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name? Shae, Your Grace. Tell us a story, Shae. When I was 13, I Your Grace! What news? The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls. Where is Joffrey? On the battlements with Lord Tyrion. Bring him back inside at once. - Your Grace - What? The king's presence is good for morale. Bring him back to his chambers now. - Not here? - With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life? - No, but I - Now! When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive. Help me! Fall back! Fall back! Get the ladders up! Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum! Someone bring me a drink. Fuck the water. Bring me wine. Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too? Eat shit, dwarf. You're on the wrong side of the wall. I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire. Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight. You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city. Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king. Loose! Put your backs into it! All right, get up! Loose! Clear! Forward! Loose! Forward ladders! Heave! Heave! Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep. If you won't defend your own city, why should they? What would you have me do? Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them. What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me? She did not say, Your Grace. All men to the battlements! Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle. Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself. Stand fast! No! Get up, you fool. We need more arrows! Where is the king? - Why isn't he with us? Who are we fighting for? Who leads us? I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack! - Yes. - What are you talking about? Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you? The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates. There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses. Heave! Heave! Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape. Heave! Heave! Heave! Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them. The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart. Where is my son? I want to escort him back to the battle. Why do I care what you want? - Bring me - Now listen to me Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Save our sons from war, we pray You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will. - Come with me. - I need to say goodbye to someone. The queen said they'd rape everyone. No one is raping me. Go. Run. The lady is starting to panic. What are you doing here? Not here for long. - I'm going. - Where? Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be. What about the king? He can die just fine on his own. I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell. I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home? I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me. Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them. You won't hurt me. No, little bird, I won't hurt you. Heave! Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders! Attack! Roll it over! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Oh, fuck me. Shh! Be calm, my sweet. They're still fighting. No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? - They lived in the woods. - The Kingswood? Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things. Like what? Like stags. Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass. And wolves. My lord. CERSEl: He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, \"You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid. \"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. \"You will be king. \"All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. \"The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, \"all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, \"they will all come to you, little lion, \"to rest a crown upon your head. \" And the cub said, \"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?\" \"Yes,\" said his mother. \"You will be strong and fierce just like your father. \" I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you. Back to the boats! Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you! No! Father. The battle is over. We have won. \"And who are you,\" the proud lord said \"That I must bow so low?\" \"Only a cat of a different coat \"That's all the truth I know \"In a coat of gold or a coat of red \"A lion still has claws \"And mine are long and sharp, my lord \"As long and sharp as yours\" And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o'er his hall With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear", "summary": ["Plot Tyrion and the Lannisters fight for their lives as Stannis's fleet assaults King's Landing.  Summary In King's Landing Bronn singing Bronn singing with the Lannister soldiers  Tyrion Lannister leads the defense of King's Landing against an assault by King Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater. He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with Shae, telling her she can still leave the city, but she stays loyal to him. Tyrion has Varys provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. Varys tells Tyrion that he is all that stands between them and defeat. Bronn drinks with the Lannister men and has a confrontation with the Hound. Bronn 2x09 Bronn fires the arrow that triggers the wildfire explosion.  Stannis plans a naval assault aiming to overcome the city's small defensive fleet and land his troops at the walls of the city near the Mud Gate, unaware of Tyrion's plan. From the battlements, Joffrey berates Tyrion, demanding to know why his ships are not meeting Stannis's fleet. Tyrion has anticipated his strategy and does not field his fleet. Instead he sends a single ship filled with Wildfire into the heart of Stannis's fleet, leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water. Bronn has been awaiting Tyrion's signal outside the city on the shores of the bay, and when Tyrion tosses a torch from the battlements, Bronn fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive, massive aquatic explosion. The ensuing conflagration devastates Stannis's fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain, Davos Seaworth, as well as killing Davos's son, Matthos.  Sandor demoralised Sandor breaks down.  Stannis responds by putting his men ashore inside row boats, landing further from the walls to avoid the still burning inner bay. With less protection for his troops he predicts that thousands will die. He leads the assault personally and is the first to reach the walls. Tyrion orders Sandor Clegane to lead a sortie beyond the Mud Gate to repel the attackers. Sandor does as asked but is terrified by the fire and breaks down emotionally. Ser Lancel Lannister accompanies him and is wounded by an arrow. Bronn joins the fight in time to save the Hound's life. The Hound retreats after losing half of his men and refuses to go out again. He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the Kingsguard, after saying in the presence of all, including the king, \"Fuck the kings guard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.\"  Queen Regent Cersei Lannister offers protection to the ladies of the court in Maegor's Holdfast. She was gifted previously Essence of Nightshade (which was explained as \"calming\" with one drop in wine; will send one into a deep sleep with three drops, and with ten drops is lethal) by Grand Maester Pycelle and keeps the headsman Ser Ilyn Payne at her side at all times, preparing for the worst. She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems to simultaneously torment and mother her captive, Sansa Stark, with matter-of-fact descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls. She also begins to question Shae, who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden. When Lancel comes to tell her that Stannis has reached the walls Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey back to the Red Keep, ignoring his protests that it would damage morale.  Tyrion speech Tyrion rallies the troops  Joffrey willingly leaves the defensive line with Lancel and charges Ser Mandon Moore and Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard to fight in the King's name. The gold cloaks' morale is broken by his departure. Tyrion steels himself to lead a sortie of his own. He rallies his men by telling them to fight for their city, their homes and their women, if not for their king and utters his famous line, \"Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!\" He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat Stannis's troops manning a battering ram at the Mud Gate. Tyrion is betrayed by Ser Mandon while fighting against a group of reinforcements. Mandon attacks Tyrion with the intent of killing him but misjudged the distance and only slashes Tyrion across the face with his sword. Before he can strike Tyrion again, Tyrion's squire Podrick Payne kills Ser Mandon from behind with his spear. Tyrion, barely conscious and held by Podrick watches a battle that seems lost before losing consciousness.  Lancel shot 2x09 Lancel wounded by arrow to shoulder  Lancel returns to Cersei to warn that they are defeated unless Joffrey returns. When Lancel tries to be firm with her, Cersei ignores his counsel, pushes him out of the way (deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side), and storms out. Sansa tries to keep up the morale of the other women, frightened by Cersei's sudden departure. Sansa leads the sheltered noblewomen in singing a hymn. Cersei has taken Tommen to the throne room. She sits with him on the Iron Throne, and tells him a story about a young lion and how he did not need to fear other beasts of the forest, the wolf and the stag. As she does this, she readies the poison (the Essence of Nightshade, mentioned and gifted earlier) for herself and for her son.  Shae tells Sansa to go to her chambers, lock herself in, and await Stannis, as he would not harm her but Ser Ilyn might. Sansa finds the Hound waiting in her room. He offers to take her north to Winterfell, but she says she will be safe there when Stannis takes the throne.  Cersei and Tommen 2x09 Cersei and Tommen sit on the Iron Throne as the battle rages.  The Hound scares Sansa, but tells her to look at him, saying that since the world is made up of killers like Stannis, her father, her brother Robb, and he himself, she better get used to looking at them. Though he promises to protect her, she is still too afraid of him to go with him.  Tywin and Loras Tywin and Loras lead their victorious forces into the throne room.  The forces of Tywin Lannister and his new allies in House Tyrell join the battle. Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of Renly Baratheon and he decimates Stannis's army. The survivors flee to their ships. Stannis is dragged from the battle by his guards, screaming for his men to stand and fight. Tyrion collapses into unconsciousness as the battle turns in the Crown's favor. Tywin bursts into the throne room and announces their victory, just in time to stop Cersei from killing Tommen. Ser Loras Tyrell reveals himself as the knight wearing Renly's armor."], "review": null}, "19": {"id": "s02e10", "name": "Valar Morghulis", "script": "Pod. Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive. Yes, my lord. Would you like something for the pain? What happened? The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father. Where am I? These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King. For your trouble. I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King. Thank you, Your Grace. Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward. For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time. You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons. Ser Loras Tyrell. Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours. Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor ofjoining our houses. Is this what you want, Lady Margaery? With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me. I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word. Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside. Margaery! We want Margaery! I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow. Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods. The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day. My lady. My sincerest condolences. They're right. I'm not good enough for him. You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well. But, if he's not marrying me He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home. King's Landing is my home now. Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you. Come in. Make yourself comfortable. That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me. - No need for that, my dear. - You sure? Most men like what they see. I'm not like most men. That's what most men say. If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do. I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be. Have we met? You wouldn't remember me if we had? I meet a lot of men. And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them. You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor. You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there. I know who you are. And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other. How do you know about that? I thought you said you knew who I was. What can I do for you, Lord Varys? Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner. - I'm afraid of him. - Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks. You're a virgin, I take it? Walk. Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne. One or two tried. Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. - I'm strong enough. - Not interested. Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman. Ah. \"They lay with lions. \" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks. I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams. - What are you doing? - Burying them. We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river. I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think. I didn't leave it here. I had me dagger. Untie me. Now! I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more. So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here? Traveling a prisoner. - You're a woman. - A woman! Well, fuck me! If you've quite finished up - All right, we'll be going. - Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for? The Starks. What did he do? - Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew? - No, stealing is a crime. But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you. - Where are you taking him? - To Riverrun. Why Riverrun? Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in. - Why not kill him? - For stealing a pig? I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone. Sending him with you? How important could he be? All right, have it your way, my lady. - Do I know you? - Have you been to Ashemark? - No. - Then you don't know me. Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock? - Is it near Ashemark? - No. I've never been there. What do you think of these beauties? I hope you gave them quick deaths. Two of them we did, yeah. Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister. I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig. If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it. How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like? I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king. He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head. I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three. Two quick deaths. Those were Stark men. I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay. Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross. I know that. And you mean to do it anyway? I love her. I know that seems important to you. It is important to me. Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer. And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, - what you and father had? - Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting? Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it. And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless. You said you saw my victory in the flames. I did. - I still see it. - The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me? The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses. You claimed to speak for a god. Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle? You talk about war as if you understand it. I've been fighting far longer than you. Have you? Show me how you fight. Show me. Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god? Inside you. I murdered my brother. We murdered him. Share the weight with me. He wasn't your brother. This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king. You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know. Let me show you. Look into the fire, my king. Look. - I see fire. - Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king? Yes. I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall. They want you to know you're surrounded. I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded. They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me. No word from my father? No. Send more ravens. You killed all the ravens. The first time I saw Winterfell First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, \"Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. \"We never stood a chance against the man who lives here. \" Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home. Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man. Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you. And what's your counsel, trusted friend? Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have 20 men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run. There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family. Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch. Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven. I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates. There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there. The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep. The opportunity to make amends for what you've done. I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing. I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet. You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else. You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one. They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland. Aye! - You think they're right? - Aye. We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle. Aye! - Mothers will name their sons for us. - Aye! Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them. Aye! And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke! Aye! - What is dead may never die! - What is dead may never die! Thought he'd never shut up. It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt. What is this? What are you doing? Let's go home. Come on. Why should I believe you? Why would I lie about it? To create strife between my sister and me. Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man. - Pod. - Yes, my lord? Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week? - No, my lord. - You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times. I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak. - Then my hill tribesmen. - Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord. Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends. We are. Podrick, would you mind? There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget. Come along now, Podrick. My love. It was good of you to come. Good of me? Of course I come. - I want to see you. - Believe me, you don't. Have you looked? I will be the first. Well? You are a mess. I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. - You should charge me double. - You think I'm here for money? That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me. Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. - Let's leave. - Leave? Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. - You don't belong here. - What would we do in Pentos? Eat, drink, fuck, live. I want to go with you. So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me. I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Outtalking them, outthinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave? You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine. In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon one another and say the words. - Father, smith - Father, smith - warrior, mother - warrior, mother - maiden, crone, stranger. - maiden, crone, stranger. - I am hers and she is mine - I am his and he is mine - from this day until the end of my days. - from this day until the end of my days. A house of ghosts, Khaleesi. It is known. Where are the guards? No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel. Let them try. Is this a riddle? Khaleesi! Khaleesi! Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl? How did he find us? - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you. How did you know we'd come this way? After all the things you have seen, this is your question? How did you kill those guards? Was it hard? No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way. Show me how. - I want to be able to do it, too. - If you would learn, you must come with me. Where? Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos. My dancing master was from Braavos. To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one. I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too. Then we must part. A man has duties as well. - Here. - What is it? A coin of great value. Could it buy a horse? It is not meant for the buying of horses. Then what good is it? If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, \"Valar Morghulis. \" Valar Morghulis. Please don't go, Jaqen. Jaqen is dead. Say it again. Valar Morghulis. Valar Morghulis. Good. Farewell, Arya Stark. Osha, what are you doing? Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers. - We'll make you better. - I feel just fine. They burned it down. They burned everything. Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north. North's the wrong way. And Mother and brother are south. We don't know where. There are too many enemies in the south. Go to the Wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe. I don't want to leave you. No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here. Osha. You must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind. I've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. - Tell me where to find it. - I don't want milk of the poppy. Do it quickly. Moon of my life. This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands. Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you. That sounds like something you would do. Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms. You are the moon of my life. That is all I know and all I need to know. And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me. Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. They miss their mother. They want to be with you. Do you want to be with them? You will be. When your dragons were born, our magic was born again. It is strongest in their presence. And they are strongest in yours. You will be with them, through winter, summer, winter again. Across a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them. And we will be with you until time comes to an end. Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn. This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me. They will be waiting a long time. Dracarys. We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go. Careful with that. You might cut yourself. Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle. Enough of that! - Stop! - Why, traitor? So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black? Let 'em fight. That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit. Your traitor father teach you that? Or was it your whore mother? We are the watchers on the Wall. You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand. - Burn the body. Aye. You don't want this one coming back for you. Come along, Jon Snow. Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall. What the Khaleesi, please. He said you'd never leave Qarth alive. Come. Nothing. Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson. I am king of Qarth. I can help you now, truly help you. We can take the Iron Throne. - I'll bring you a thousand ships. - Please, Khaleesi, I beg you. All that you have dreamed is within your reach! I beg you, please! - Khaleesi. - Please! Please! Khaleesi! It's all a lie. Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship? Aye, a small ship. Take all the gold and jewels. I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings. Is this goat? It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm. Well, you see a tree, let me know. If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is - Just bloody kill me. - No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better. The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you. And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing. It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back. Two blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone. Come on. Three blasts? Run! Wait! Wait for me! Grenn! Edd!", "summary": ["Plot Tyrion awakens to a changed situation.

In new, shabby quarters, Tyrion Lannister convalesces from the wound he suffered during the Battle of the Blackwater at the hands of Ser Mandon Moore. He is informed by a gloating Grand Maester Pycelle that he is no longer Acting Hand of the King, as his father Tywin Lannister has returned to the city and will take over his duties as Hand. Varys visits and tells him that Bronn has been relieved of his command of the gold cloaks and his hill tribesmen have gone home with their plunder; Tyrion has lost all of his power. Varys thanks Tyrion for his part in defending the city, noting that no one else will do so. Shae urges Tyrion to leave with her for Pentos, but he refuses.   King Joffrey rewards those who served him well in the battle. Lord Tywin Lannister is officially named Hand of the King and Savior of the City. Littlefinger is awarded Harrenhal for brokering the alliance between Houses Lannister and Tyrell. Loras Tyrell asks that Joffrey wed his sister Margaery to unite their houses. Queen Cersei Lannister and Pycelle make a show of convincing Joffrey to set aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark, given the treachery of House Stark. Joffrey plays along and agrees to wed Margaery. In private, Sansa is overjoyed to be free, until Littlefinger points out that it will not stop Joffrey from tormenting her; however, he does assure her that he will help her escape, for the sake of her mother.  Ros is visited by Varys, though she doesn't realize who he is until she discovers his eunuch status. Varys gets Ros to admit she's afraid of Littlefinger, and tells her that unlike her current employer, he protects those who work for him.  At Dragonstone Following his defeat at the Blackwater, Stannis Baratheon has retreated back to Dragonstone. He rages at Melisandre for not foreseeing his defeat, despite her claims to see the future. Melisandre insists that the Lord of Light only allows her glimpses and that Stannis cannot abandon the war because of a single defeat. Stannis accuses her of lying to him, of knowing nothing about war and angrily begins to strangle her. When Melisandre insists her god is in him, Stannis releases her, realizing she is talking about the creature they created to murder his brother. Melisandre tells Stannis he will betray his men, his family and his beliefs but in the end, it will be worth it; she assures Stannis that he is the Lord's Chosen and he will be king. Stannis is skeptical, but Melisandre has him look into a brazier; Stannis appears to have visions, restoring his faith in the Red Priestess.  In the Westerlands 210 Robb Talisa wedding 3 Robb and Talisa are wed.  In the Westerlands, King Robb Stark speaks with his mother Lady Catelyn regarding his love affair with the woman Talisa. Catelyn urges Robb to remember his vow to wed a daughter of House Frey, or face severe consequences.

She predicts that Robb and his betrothed might build a similar love over time. Robb disregards her advice and marries Talisa in private that night. Brienne Jaime Stark Men 2x10 Jaime recognized by Stark men.  Traveling east to King's Landing, Brienne of Tarth and Jaime Lannister come upon the bodies of three women, hanged by Stark soldiers for having slept with Lannister soldiers. When the men return, the pair try to lie their way out of the situation. Jaime is recognized and Brienne chose to kill the soldiers. In so doing she reveals her prowess as a fighter to Jaime.

At Winterfell In Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy is besieged by a northern army under command of Roose Bolton's bastard son. Maester Luwin tells Theon his chances of holding the castle with only twenty men are negligible. Luwin suggests that Theon join the Night's Watch, gaining a chance to redeem himself. When Theon refuses (fearing that Jon Snow will kill him for his betrayal) and tries to rally his men for battle, they betray him; Dagmer knocks Theon out. When Luwin tries to intervene, Dagmer stabs him with a spear. The ironmen place a bag on Theon and depart Winterfell to deliver him to the Bolton army.  Some time later, Bran, Rickon, Osha and Hodor emerge from their hiding place in Winterfell's crypts and find the castle burning. They discover the dying Luwin in the godswood. He insists that the boys must go north to the Wall, as there are too many enemies in the south and Jon will be able to keep them safe and tell their mother of their survival. Luwin affirms his pride at having served the Starks before asking Osha to give him a quick death.  In the Riverlands Traveling away from Harrenhal, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie cross paths with Jaqen H'ghar, who has been waiting for them. He offers to take Arya with him to Braavos, where she can learn his skills of killing and find a way to kill those on her list. She declines, wanting to be reunited with her family. Jaqen gives her an iron coin and the words \"Valar Morghulis,\" telling her to speak them to any man from Braavos should she ever need to find him again. Jaqen bids Arya farewell, using her real name, and departs, changing his face to that of a different man as he leaves.  In Qarth Daernerys vision Iron Thrones 2x10 Daenerys in her vision of the Iron Throne room.  Daenerys Targaryen arrives at House of the Undying and is magically separated from Jorah and Kovarro. She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors. She chooses one and opens it. She is presented with tempting visions. First the snowy, ruined throne room of King's Landing where she turns away from the Iron Throne. She then walks through the gates of the Wall surrounded by more snow, and into Drogo's tent. She finds Drogo and what would have been her infant son Rhaego. They talk about whose dream they are in, and Daenerys silently leaves after touching Rhaego's hair. She returns to the room with many doors and finds her dragons chained to a pedestal in front of her. Pyat Pree appears and explains that she and her brood are the source of his restored magic. Daenerys is also chained by Pyat's magic. The young queen is unconcerned however, and simply regards Pree with a cool, almost lazy gaze. She calmly utters a single word: \"Dracarys\"; after a couple of tries, all three dragons unleash their fiery breath, and Pyat Pree is incinerated.  Daenerys knows that Xaro has betrayed her. She returns to his palace to confront him and finds Doreah in bed with him. She takes his key and uses it to open his Valyrian stone vault. She is surprised when it is empty, but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing. On her orders, Doreah and Xaro are locked into the empty vault to die, their pleas cut off by the closing door. Daenerys salvages enough from Xaro's household to buy a ship. On Jorah's orders, the Dothraki seize Xaro's gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons.  Beyond the Wall Wilding&#039;s Camp 2x10 The King-Beyond-the-Wall's Camp.  Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand are marched towards the camp of the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, as captives of the Lord of Bones. Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings, so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword, attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery. The Lord of Bones lets them fight, and Ygritte gives Jon back his sword. Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage. After a fierce duel, Jon mortally wounds Qhorin per Qhorin's own instructions, who whispers to Jon \"We are the watchers on the Wall\" before he breathes his last, signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding Jon that he must find out all he can about the wildlings' plans and get back to the Wall. By his killing Qhorin, the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him. Impressed, the Lord of Bones cuts Jon free. Ygritte shows him their vast army, gathering in a valley below. She promises to take him to their King and, with no other choice, Jon follows her.  Wights 1x10 White Walkers lead the Army of the Dead.  At the Fist of the First Men, Sam, Grenn and Edd are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts; the warning call for White Walkers. The three run back to the Fist. Sam is left behind, caught in a sudden blizzard. Seeing shadowy figures moving through the blowing snow, Sam hides behind a rock and watches as dozens of Wights walk past him, led by a White Walker riding an undead horse-wight. Sam cowers in fear, but the White Walker seemingly ignores him. Raising a spear with a blade of ice, the creature gives a piercing shriek, and the army of wights and White Walkers, numbering several hundred, advances on the Fist."], "review": null}, "20": {"id": "s03e01", "name": "Valar Dohaeris", "script": "The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night. - How?! Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. Returning him may buy life for my children. Ser Barristan Selmy, it is time to put aside your sword. You're too old to protect anyone. Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake. Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others. Where are my dragons?! I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them. Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross. I love her. The Iron Throne is mine. No one wants you for their king. Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors. If Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen. - Do you want to be a queen? - I want to be the queen. Mance is gonna march on the Wall. One brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it. - They'll never trust me. - They might if you do what needs to be done. Come along, Jon Snow. Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall. Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn. Dracarys. When I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand. I pray I serve you well. I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge. The battle is over. We have won. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery you'd be a dead man. Ser Loras Tyrell, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You said you saw my victory in the flames. This war has just begun. You will be king. It's Jon and the Halfhand. Two blasts is wildlings. Run! Fall back! Brother? Did you send the ravens? Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens? That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead. First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow? Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail. - Crow! - Crow! - Look over there! - Crow! Crow! Look over here! Look! Ah, look, crow coming! Crow! You're wearing the wrong color. Mance was a ranger. In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free. When I'm free, will I be free to go? - Crow! - Crow! Sure, you will. Oh! And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul. What happened to their fathers? Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't I smell a crow. We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one. What do we want with a baby crow? This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us. That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size. My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts. Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. - What's your name, boy? - Jon Snow. Your Grace. Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart. Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall. So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us. The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us? Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls. This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane. Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand. He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead. He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him? The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning. Why? He wants me to lead one day. But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall. If I'm a traitor, then you are, too. Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I want to be free. No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time-- why do you want to join us? We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw You saw what? I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers? Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place? We'll need to find you a new cloak. What if you took off that bit there? Don't you want to leave something to the imagination? Trouble is, I've never had much imagination. I want you to take it off. Mouth. Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn. I didn't hear that. - Apologies, ser. - Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. - Then back away some more. - Lord Tyrion sent me. I will murder you, boy. He said it was a matter of life and death. - Pod? - It's your sister. The queen. What are they doing here? Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in? No, I don't think so. If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me? They stay outside. I'm not afraid of you, little brother. - Why are you here? - I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that. The man who cut me lost more than his nose. I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father. Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me. No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room. Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees. You're meeting Father today? How do you know that? Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him? What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came. You're going to make me cry. Why do you care what I want from him? Because you've slandered me to Father before. Slandered? When? You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock. You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe. I was nine, too. She lost an eye, if I remember correctly. If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again. It's not slander if it's true. And what's this truth you plan on telling him today? Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father? Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey. Any lies in particular? You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are. Still makes me more clever than you. Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares. Ser Meryn Trant. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. - You're no knight. - Pod. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself. You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more. That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion. You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand. As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me. A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me. I've been doing that for a while now. Do you grow bored protecting me? I grow poor protecting you. Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch. - Briefly. - I'm sure you filled your pockets. And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more. - I thought we were friends. - We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor. - How much? - Double. - Double? - I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double. I don't even know how much I'm paying you now. Which means you can afford it. Here. Here! Help me! Who are you? I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight. Aye, ser, and serving which king? The one true king of Westeros-- Stannis Baratheon. I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son? He may have swam ashore as you did. No, the wildfire took him. I saw it. I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father. If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives? He licks his wounds at Dragonstone. Will you take me there? There is nothing for me at Dragonstone. This war is not over. Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over. We're both sworn to King Stannis. I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships. Stannis never gives up. Never. - Now he will regroup-- - He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one-- not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive. What? They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned. I'm a pirate. You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid. Take me back there, please. You cannot turn Stannis against her. Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out. You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend. You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day. And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors. I have to stop her. Please, do this for me. When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck. We should set the siege lines There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin. I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend. The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one. slaughtered like sheep. The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons. Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free. The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him. - A Mallister? - Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman. Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell. She's your mother. She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice. Water. Water. This needs to be cleaned and closed. What's your name, friend? Qyburn. You're lucky to be alive. Lucky? The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position? Am I enjoying it? I was very happy as Hand of the King. Yes. I heard how happy you were. You brought a whore into my bed. It wasn't your bed at the time. I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves. Occasionally I drank with the harlots. What do you want, Tyrion? Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield. Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal. I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start. Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want. I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir. You want Casterly Rock? It is mine by right. We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock. - Why? - Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go. Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang. Dorne. It's going to Dorne. - Why Dorne? - It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm. I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm. Don't ruin the game. I told you, I don't want to play. What about that one there? That one? It's going to Volantis. Why? Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one. That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why. Why should I make up a story when I know the truth? Because the truth is always either terrible or boring. Lovely day for it. Watching the ships. Lord Baelish. Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment? I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister. Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home. You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person-- - I won't tell anyone. - How do I know? Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when. I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice. You're her handmaiden? Yes. And you're his? I help manage his affairs. - He's an important person. - So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I. Yes. Given where we started. And where is that? It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her. I always do. Watch out for her with him. They're growing fast. Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army. We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world. The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people. Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne? It's too beautiful a day to argue. You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas. Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar-- The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before. Your Grace. I heard you were dead. Not yet. I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace. We are alone. Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight. I am fighting. By burning prisoners alive? How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos? I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone. - I'm not your enemy. - You are my enemy. Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them. Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true. Death by fire is the purest death. This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons. Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell. - Your Grace! - Come on. You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos. - She will destroy us all! - I will pray for you. Your Grace! Halt. Down. Halt. Down. Why have we stopped? It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace. What is she doing? Who gave her permission? My lady. We should have guards, my lady. Why? Pardon me. Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress. I have others. Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace? No. He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back. And your mother? She died when she had me. Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them. Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father. He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier. And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him. Was your father a soldier, too? You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you. Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me. - Your Grace. - Your Grace. Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time? That's a lovely gown, my lady. Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold. The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace. Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady? I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. - Doesn't it, Loras? - Yes. Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it. You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning. Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about. Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden. The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart. An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life. My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger. You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery. Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need. Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing. I'm sure she does. The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water. They will stand until they drop. Such is their obedience. They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training. _ _ _ _ _ _ They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training. Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing. Even the bravest men fear death. _ _ _ _ My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them. _ _ He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace. Tell the good master there is no need. _ _ _ My master points out that men don't need nipples. _ _ To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them. You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin? _ _ _ My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother. How many do you have to sell? _ Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested. The Unsullied are a means to an end. Once I own them, these men-- They're not men. Not anymore. Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be? Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you? You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point. You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it. The warlocks. I owe you my life, ser. The honor is mine, my queen. You know this man? I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them. I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father. Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.", "summary": ["Plot Jon is brought before Mance Rayder, the King Beyond the Wall, while the Night's Watch survivors retreat south. In King's Landing, Tyrion asks for his reward, Littlefinger offers Sansa a way out, and Cersei hosts a dinner for the royal family. Dany sails into Slaver's Bay.  Summary Beyond the Wall Ghost Attacks a Wite Ghost attacks a wight  In a prologue scene, shouts and sword clashes are heard in the darkness as the White Walkers and their army of undead wights attack the men of the Night's Watch off-screen in the Battle of the Fist of the First Men. Samwell Tarly is then seen wandering through a blizzard in search of safety. He sees another man of the Night's Watch up ahead but soon finds that he has been decapitated and his head placed in his own hands. Just then, a wight approaches Sam and is about to attack him with an axe when the direwolf Ghost knocks it down. Ghost continues to tear at its legs as it pulls itself forward inch by inch towards Sam. The wight suddenly burst into flame, destroyed by a torch wielded by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, killing it. Mormont has managed to rally the few dozen survivors out of his original three hundred men at the Fist of the First Men. Mormont is angry that Sam wasn't able to send off any messenger-ravens in the confusion of the attack. Mormont announces that they must retreat back to the Wall, not simply to save their own lives but because Castle Black and the rest of Westeros must be warned of the coming threat\u2015otherwise everyone they've ever known will die.  Meanwhile, Jon Snow is led by Ygritte and the Lord of Bones into the main wildling camp in the Frostfangs mountains. It is not simply an army camp - almost all of wildling society is on the move to escape the White Walkers, including women and children. As they enter the camp, Jon is shocked to see a real-life giant walk past. Many of the wildlings are surprised to see Jon in his all-black Night's Watch clothing and shout \"Crow!\" at his approach. Several young boys pelt Jon with ice and small stones, but Ygritte shoos them away.  Giant working S3 Ep1 Giant carrying mammoth bones  Jon is led into the tent of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder, where the Lord of Bones explains that he is Ned Stark's bastard son to a large man with a heavy beard who is eating chicken by the fire. He says that he doesn't care, but his interest is piqued on hearing that Jon killed Qhorin Halfhand. As they talk, Jon kneels before the man, whom he assumes to be Mance Rayder, and calls him \"Your Grace\" as he would a king south of the Wall. All the wildlings to burst into laughter; their society does not bother with such ceremony\u2013and because the man actually isn't Mance, but his lieutenant Tormund Giantsbane. Mance himself is an unassuming man sitting in a corner, who then introduces himself and tells Jon to stand, as no man kneels before another among the Free Folk, as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture.  Mance says he is glad that Jon killed Qhorin, as he had killed many of Mance's wildlings, though he notes that Qhorin was his brother once, back when he was a member of the Night's Watch and Qhorin had a whole hand. Mance asks Jon why he wants to join them. He replies that he wants to be free, but Mance thinks he just wants to be a hero. Jon then explains that when the Night's Watch camped at Craster's Keep, he saw Craster leave his newborn son in the woods as an offering, and the inhuman creature that took it. Jon says that he wants to leave the Night's Watch because he is disgusted that Mormont already knew what Craster was doing but did nothing to stop it. Jon states that the First Men he is descended from defeated the White Walkers once during The Long Night, and that now he wants \"to fight for the side who fights for the living.\" Mance is satisfied and advises Jon to get a new cloak.  In King's Landing Guards S3 Ep1 Bronn confronts two Kingsguard  In King's Landing, King Joffrey Baratheon's forces stand victorious after the Battle of the Blackwater. House Lannister's new allies House Tyrell begin to settle into the capital. Tywin Lannister bluntly tells his son Tyrion that he intends to disinherit him. This comes as a shock, because his older brother Jaime gave up all right to inherit his father's lands when he joined the Kingsguard, and Tyrion is rightfully the next in line of succession. For that matter, despite all evidence to the contrary, Tywin refuses to believe that Tyrion was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting Hand of the King. Instead, Tywin obstinately maintains his belief that Tyrion is a whore-mongering, drunken, \"ill-made, spiteful little creature,\" and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy. Tywin is particularly insulted that Tyrion brought his mistress, Shae, to the capital when Tywin explicitly told him not to, which makes Tywin convince himself that Tyrion was in bed with Shae most of the time while events spiraled out of control. When Tyrion asks why his father is doing this, Tywin is shocked as if Tyrion insulted him, and says it should be obvious as Tyrion \"killed\" his mother Joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world. Tywin says that the laws of men say he has to let Tyrion use his family name, but that he wishes he could prove Tyrion wasn't his son, so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name \"Lannister\" which he stole from Tywin. Tyrion fumes at the situation to his sellsword Bronn, who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the Battle of the Blackwater. He now styles himself as \"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,\" and while possessing no lands, wealth, or title, this drastically elevates his social standing\u2013and in his mind, his pay.  Meanwhile, Joffrey's ride back from the Great Sept of Baelor in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed, Lady Margaery Tyrell, stops the procession in Flea Bottom unexpectedly. Margaery shocks the guards and bewilders Joffrey by getting out and exploring, eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children. Meanwhile, her servants pass out bread and toys, earning her the love of Flea Bottom's smallfolk. That evening, Joffrey and Cersei visit Margaery and her brother Loras Tyrell for a small dinner party. Cersei admonishes Margaery's boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier.  When Joffrey naively defends Margaery and criticizes his mother, Cersei realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered. Cersei only knows how to rule through fear, but Margaery knows how to win the love of the people she rules over, a skill Cersei lacks. Sansa Stark and Shae sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart. Sansa wants to play a game making up stories about where the ships are headed, but Shae, in typical fashion, is uninterested. Petyr Baelish arrives to speak with Sansa.  She displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible. He suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea, she might be able to stow away. Sansa advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar. Meanwhile, Ros, who seems to be acting as Littlefinger's aide, reminisces about the day Sansa was born, when all the bells in Winterfell were rung in celebration. She asks Shae to look out for Sansa, particularly in regards to Littlefinger.  Davos Seaworth is rescued from the sea by Salladhor Saan after being thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the battle. Forlorn over the death of his son Matthos, Davos feels that Melisandre has led Stannis to disaster, and is horrified to hear from Salladhor that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices. After the defeated remnant of Stannis' forces returned to the island, Melisandre ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the Lord of Light. Davos convinces Salladhor to bring him to Dragonstone.  At Dragonstone Davos Melisandre assassination S3 E1 Davos tries to kill Melisandre  On Dragonstone, King Stannis Baratheon's shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the Battle of the Blackwater. Davos returns and finds Stannis despondent, sitting in the Chamber of the Painted Table alone with Melisandre. Davos openly calls Melisandre his enemy, condemns her for conducting human sacrifices, and says she is leading Stannis astray. She counters that it was Davos who urged Stannis not to bring her to the battle, and implies that it was actually Davos' fault that thousands of their men burned to death, including his own son. At the mention of his son Davos draws a knife on her in a fit of anger, but he is restrained by the guards, and Stannis orders him put in the dungeon. At Harrenhal In the Riverlands, the morale of King Robb Stark's army is starting to wane. They have not had a significant victory since the Battle of Oxcross months ago, and the news of the Lannisters' victory over Stannis and new alliance with the Tyrells piles bad news upon bad news. Robb has won every battle he has ever fought, but the Lannisters finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on, so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of Robb's army. Robb's forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories, as the Lannisters are now determined to simply wait Robb out and exhaust his army far from home while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies. In frustration, Robb launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of Harrenhal, which Tywin had been using it as the main Lannister forward base in the Riverlands during the first year of the war. However, Robb does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for: Tywin withdrew his garrison to King's Landing to counter the attack by Stannis, and didn't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle. Robb and his forces are further demoralized to find that the Lannisters massacred two hundred Northern and Riverlands prisoners of war before they left, and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies. They do find one survivor, a maester named Qyburn.  In Slaver's Bay Drogo fire with fish S3 Ep1 Drogon roasts a fish  Daenerys Targaryen's ship arrives at the city of Astapor in Slaver's Bay after leaving Qarth. Daenerys' dragons are continuing to grow, and are now about the size of small dogs. They fly about their ship as it approaches the city, plucking fish from the sea and roasting them in mid-air with their fire-breath.She notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade Westeros with, and that she needs an army. Ser Jorah Mormont notes that the elite warrior-eunuchs produced in Astapor, known as the Unsullied, are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world. Daenerys stresses that they are slave-soldiers, a distinction which may make some look on her negatively in Westeros where slavery is illegal, but Jorah says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an army. Daenerys expresses interest in expanding her tiny Dothraki khalasar (most of them are seasick because the Dothraki have never traveled on ships before), but Jorah says that other Dothraki will only join her if they think she is strong, and for that she needs an army.  Upon arriving at Astapor, Daenerys is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied's owner, Kraznys mo Nakloz, with his slave girl Missandei translating his Low Valyrian into the Common Tongue of Westeros for Daenerys. They explain that the Unsullied are trained for battle from the age of five, and that only one in four recruits survives the training. Kraznys also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier (much to Daenerys's disgust), who not only shows no sign of pain, but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him. Kraznys goes on to explain that the Unsullied are trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training. Daenerys is outraged by this, but still asks how many Unsullied are available. She is told there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision.  En route back to their ship, Ser Jorah urges that Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied, arguing that under her command, these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under Kraznys and his ilk. Daenerys is distracted by a playing child following her and Jorah, and neither notice a man in a hooded black cloak following them, armed with a dagger.  Barristan Manticore S3 Ep1 Barristan saves Daenerys from a deadly manticore  The child offers a gift to Daenerys - a wooden ball - but as she picks it up, the hooded stranger knocks it out of her hands; Ser Jorah grabs the stranger and their struggle knocks Daenerys to the ground, where to her horror, the ball cracks in half and a manticore emerges to attack. Before the creature can harm Daenerys with its lethal sting, the stranger impales it with his dagger and charges at the child, who hisses in a reptilian manner, baring teeth and features reminiscent of Pyat Pree, and uses magic to escape. Daenerys realizes the assassin was likely an agent of the surviving Warlocks of Qarth.  Turning her attention to her savior, Daenerys is surprised when the man addresses her as his Queen and removes his hood. She asks if Jorah knows the man. A stunned Jorah admits he does; the stranger before them is one of the most skilled fighters in Westeros: Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. Falling to his knees, Ser Barristan explains that following Robert's death and his dismissal by Joffrey, he has been searching for Daenerys Stormborn, to beg her forgiveness and offer his service, hoping to make amends for failing House Targaryen during and after Robert's Rebellion, when he served in her father's Kingsguard. Barristan hails her as the rightful Queen and asks to serve in her Queensguard."], "review": null}, "21": {"id": "s03e02", "name": "Dark Wings, Dark Words", "script": "Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. When I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. How did you kill those guards? Show me how. If you would learn, you must come with me. I want to, but I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. You have to go. Go to the Wall, to Jon.

Those were Stark men. I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom this morning. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about. Not long ago we were attacked by a mob there. The king barely escaped with his life. My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. You said you'd take me home. If you were to tell just one Please, Lord Baelish, tell me what to do. - Tell me when. - Watch out for her. Watch out for her with him. Ah! We need to get back to the Wall. We know what's out there, but we have to warn them.  Don't think too much, Bran. Relax your bow arm. And which one of you was a marksman at 10? Father? You can't kill it, you know. Why not? Because the raven is you. Hodor. It's all right, Hodor. Hodor. Were you inside the wolf again, little lord? No, it was the three-eyed raven. He's back. I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. - There was a boy. - I don't want to hear about it. - But you asked. - We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them. I didn't ask for black magic dreams. I know you didn't, little lord. We need to move. We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive. And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you? - No. - Some good he is, then. I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off. My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds. Did you ever think you'd marry one? I never thought I'd marry anyone at all. Never? Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians. Pardon me, Your Grace. - My queen. - Lord Bolton. Let me guess which one is the good news. Word from Riverrun and Winterfell. I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many. We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return. Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest? Something else? By the time Bolton's bastard got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages. Have you received any demands? No. Have you heard anything from Theon at all? Where am I? Who are you? What do you want? I want to do this. Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests? Yes. So how shall we pass the time? By putting one foot in front of the other. It's going to be a very dull walk. I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine. You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword. If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman. All the good it's done her. How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about. Not your concern, Kingslayer. It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell. How would you know? Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways. Move. - Were you pledged to Stannis? - Gods, no. Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal. - Shut your mouth. - Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you. I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king. Sounds like you quite fancied him. I did not fancy him. Oh, gods, you did. Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid. He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him. I'm not interested in foul rumors. Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. - They'd have never got him off it. - Shut your mouth! I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love. - Where are you headed, then? - South. - You? - Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. - You can't win. - No, you really can't. Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. - Seven blessings to you. - And you. He knows who I am. - He doesn't. - Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone? We're not doing it. He's an innocent man. More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters? Make it tighter here. That's better. It makes you look very strong. No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others. Yes, Your Grace. Bloody flowers. On the king. Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric. Tell me what you think of her. Who? Margaery. She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century. It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent. Yes, she is. Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting. Not to me. I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself-- This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had. Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason. She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-- what they're told. - You need to ask yourself-- - I don't need to do anything. Better. Much better. I still don't believe it. He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother. Men only want one thing from a pretty girl. Littlefinger's not in love with me. Love is not the thing he wants. He's too old. They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or? No. If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me. Why? What will you do? I will make him stop. Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady. Send him in. Lady Sansa. Ser Loras. My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens. May I escort you to them? I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa. You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose. Of course I did. It's more your color. - You take it. - Thank you. You're such a dear. I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa. Thank you, Ser Loras. Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell. Kiss me, child. It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses. And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. - He was very gallant. - Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king. Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras. Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-- Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us? She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes? Lemon cake's my favorite. So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others. Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden? I haven't had the pleasure. No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey. I I You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you? Has he ripped out your tongue? Joff-- King Joffrey, he-- His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion. Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand? I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means. Bring me some cheese. The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady. The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now. Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you. My father always told the truth. Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head. Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it. Go on. I-- I can't. I never meant-- my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore. She's terrified, Grandmother. - Just look at her. - Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it. He's a monster. Ah. That's a pity. Please, don't stop the wedding. Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese. We're at war. This march is a distraction. My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction. - Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No. Then it's a distraction. My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men. Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference. Have you lost faith in our cause? If it's revenge, I still got faith in it. If you no longer believe-- I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men. You don't think we can win? May I speak my mind, Your Grace? Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark? I think you lost this war the day you married her. Whoa, whoa. Your Grace. You're afraid of her. - And she knows it. - I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark? No. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-- You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them. You've made them before? Twice. Did they work? After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall. Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering. Which boy? Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us. And he lived. And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child. Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand? Yes. You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. - These are my people. - I understand. Well, how could you understand? You want to protect your people. Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army? No. I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth. Shouldn't be long now. What's wrong with him? He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us. What, you've never met a warg? Orell. Where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men. What did you see? Dead crows. What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to. Hey. Get up, Sam. - No. - Get up. I can't. If you stop, you'll die. 'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too. - You don't care. - 'Course we care. You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me. Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die. Help me get him up. Looks like that piggy is done for. - Help us get him up. - He's slowing us down. Just get him up! Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him. What is this? Get up, Tarly. - Is he all right? - Aye, I think so. If he can't, we may as well just go without him. That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me? - Why should the rest of us-- - Rast you're responsible for him. What am I supposed to do? Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on! I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me? Where's Rickon and Hodor? Looking for food. What's out there? Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood. I'm unarmed. That was poor planning. My sister carries the weapons. I'm better with them. Drop the spear. Drop it. If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits. You must be Summer. I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go. I'm just trying to understand. Would you please shut up about it? Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills. - I'm not listening. - But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey. - Shut up. - You could have picked Tywin Lannister. Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining? But you could have ended the war. - Where are we going? - North. If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now. Maybe we already passed it. It's 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us. Could be a minstrel. Shut up.  A lion still has claws  A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, - and buy some food. - Shh.  And so he spoke, and so he spoke   That Lord of Castamere   But now the rains   Weep o'er his hall   With no one there to hear.  What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf? Just a dirty little cub, I think. - Loose a few more shafts. - Don't. Put the sword down, girl. You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you. Generous. You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy? What friends? The fat one to your left and the lad beside him. Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal? - Who are you? - Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy. No, who do you fight for? The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal. I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us. You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way. Here's the thing, fat boy. When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking. Half the country's starving and look at this one. Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving. My lion. We've spoken of this. You cannot come here. But you said I should come to you with any problems. Did anyone see you? - No. - You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain. All right. What is this problem? I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him. Baelish doesn't have friends. I don't know her name. - Oh, Ros? The redhead? - How do you know her? I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need. She's a whore. Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things. - You fucked her. - Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice. But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else. And was she good? Did you like her? Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger? That Sansa shouldn't trust him. Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger? We have to protect her. We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name. A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty? Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-- to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you. You pervert. You want her? - This child? - I don't even want to talk about her. - But you are. - Only because you're making me. I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out. This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair. \"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.\" Hmm, yes. Now do you think I'm cruel? Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again. Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people. Lady Tyrell, my king. Send her in. You wanted to see me, Your Grace? I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left. That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want. Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp. A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady. And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady? Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all. What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it? The duty of any wife to any husband-- to provide him with children. You failed to do this. - Why? - I-- I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace. You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart? No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women. What makes you say this? Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-- he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-- something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me. No, he was a known degenerate. It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace. Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death. As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do. You are the king. Yes. I am. Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms. It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works? It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string. The bolt goes here. And then you just aim and Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman. It's not unheard of. My father would never let me before-- You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it? May I? Please. I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there. Could you do it? Could you kill something? I don't know, Your Grace. Do you think I could? Yes. Would you like to watch me? Yes. Stop! Stop! - Tell us the truth. - About what? I don't know what you want. I want the truth. What truth? Why'd you take Winterfell? I took it to-- I took it-- - Who gave the orders? - No one. - I took it on my own. - Why? To take the North while it was vulnerable. What were you going to do once you took it? Hold it. Rule it. Good. That's very good. Why did you do that? I told you. Why did you take Winterfell? I took it to bring glory to my house and my father. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them. What are you doing? Please. I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off. - Your sister sent me. - Yara? I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps. No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go. Rickon, stay with us. It's all right. The wolves will protect him. You can get inside his head, see through his eyes. Only when I'm asleep. That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg. It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-- - A three-eyed raven? - You've seen it? We saw him together. You haven't forgotten? Does it have anything to do with warging? No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight. Seeing things that haven't happened yet? Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away. What's he telling him? Why don't you ask? Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him? Where's the shame in that? Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting. Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping. When my father died, I dreamt it. You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I. You have the sight, too? When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry. Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah. He saved my father's life during the rebellion. Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too. What else have you seen? Only one thing that matters-- you. I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand. I don't drink ale. There's no story so good a drink won't make it better. - Yeah! - You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-- We're not children. How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal? Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory. A smith, eh? Where'd you train? King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop. That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city. That's because he's twice as good. Aha! A smith and a salesman. Gendry stole us weapons. Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see. He knows how to use a sword and so do I. My brothers taught me. Ooh! To your brothers! You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another. - You'll free us? - I gave you my word. But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-- Hey, hey. Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person? One waits for him to drink until he passes out. Poor man. You have my sympathy. Aha, not a man at all. A Hound! So good to see you again, Clegane. Thoros? The fuck you doing here? Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever. - A pretty prize, lads. - Yeah! Girl. What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? It's a tough decision-- take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water. - Silence, Kingslayer. - Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river. Good luck. It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose? Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed. Be quick about it. - I need to rest. - Get up. I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. - What do you call them? - Get up now. Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year. This heel is ruined. There's no way-- I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords. Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman. You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game. Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you. You're good. Graceless, but good. See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there. Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman. We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste. - You sure he's the one? - That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding. Give the man his silver. Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want. Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours.", "summary": ["Plot Sansa says too much. Shae asks Tyrion for a favor. Jaime finds a way to pass the time. Arya runs into the Brotherhood Without Banners.  Summary Beyond the Wall Jon Snow marches slowly South with the Free Folk army of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. Mance explains that his army is a diverse force, formed of about ninety different groups or clans of wildlings, who speak seven different languages, and have numerous internal rivalries. However, he managed to unite them all by telling them the truth: that they will all die if they remain north of the Wall. Mance brings Jon to one of his scouts, Orell. He is sitting silently with his eyes rolled back as an eagle circles above him. Mance says that he is a \"warg\", and Ygritte is surprised that Jon doesn't know what that is. Mance explains that a warg is a person who is capable of entering the mind of an animal, seeing what it sees and even controlling its actions. Orell controls his menagerie to scout miles ahead. Mance asks him what he has seen, and Orell says he saw the Fist of the First Men - and many dead \"crows\".  Rast Piggy and Mormont Mormont assigns Rast care of Tarly.  Lord Commander Jeor Mormont of the Night's Watch leads the few survivors of the slaughter at the Battle of the Fist of the First Men south in hope of reaching the Wall. Samwell Tarly is exhausted and collapses. Rast is annoyed that Sam hid during the battle, and thinks they should leave him because he's slowing them down. Sam is upset that Grenn and Edd abandoned him at the start of the attack, although they refuse to leave him now. Mormont tells Sam that he has to keep moving, and sternly forbids Sam to die. Mormont orders Rast to keep Sam alive until they reach the Wall on pain of death.  In the North Bran Stark dreams that he is walking and hunting in the woods; he sees the mysterious Three-Eyed Raven again. As he aims his bow, he relives his memories of when he was practicing archery with Jon and Robb, and hears the voice of his father Eddard. Bran shoots at the raven but misses. A young stranger appears. The boy tells Bran that he cannot shoot the raven, because he is the raven. Bran awakens suddenly, worrying Hodor for a moment but he says that he is fine. Osha says they have enough problems without dark dreams. Bran, Rickon, Osha, Hodor, and the direwolves Summer and Shaggydog continue to head north from Winterfell to the Wall.  Meera S3 Osha Meera holds a knife to Osha's throat.  Later, the same boy from the dream approaches their camp in the woods unarmed. Summer snarls at him initially but then sniffs his hand and turns away. Osha comes up behind the boy with a sharpened wooden spear, only for the boy's sister to surprise Osha and put a knife to her throat. The boy introduces himself as Jojen Reed, and his sister as Meera Reed. House Reed are loyal bannermen of House Stark, and they have been searching for Bran and Rickon so that they can protect them.  When they are on the move again, Jojen and Bran discuss his wolf-dreams. Jojen explains that Bran himself is a warg. Jojen says that it starts out as vivid dreams seeing the world through his wolf's eyes, but with practice he will be able to consciously enter the mind of his wolf and control its actions. Bran asks if prophetic dreams are part of being a warg, but Jojen explains that's a different, related ability. \"The Sight\" allows those who possess it to see events that haven't happened yet, or events that happened long before they were born, or events happening now but thousands of miles away. Jojen confirms that Bran's dream of his father Eddard the day he died was an example of the Sight, and that Jojen himself had a similar dream the same day. He says that when he told his father, Lord Howland Reed, he openly wept, for he correctly realized that his son's dream signified that Eddard was dead. Bran says that Howland was a great friend of his father Eddard's who fought alongside him during Robert's Rebellion. Jojen says that Howland doesn't like to talk about the war much. Jojen confirms that Bran wasn't simply experiencing a vision of Jojen in his earlier dream, but that he reached out with his mind to contact Bran in his dream, and that he remembers seeing the Three-Eyed Raven too.  At the Dreadfort At an indeterminate location, Theon Greyjoy has been chained up in a dungeon after being knocked out before the Sack of Winterfell. Men come in, some wearing ironborn clothing, and interrogate him. When he asks what they want, one of his captors says he wants to do \"this\" and starts prying his fingernails off with a knife. Later they use a foot press to torture him, while also slowly turning a screw into his foot until it is bleeding freely, repeatedly asking him why he captured Winterfell, but apparently not caring about the answers he gives. Theon at first tells them the simple truth that he wanted to take and hold Winterfell while the North was vunerable to impress his father, then starts frantically lying, saying he hates the Starks and is their enemy, desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them. When the guards leave they put a bag over his head. A servant boy comes over to Theon and unwinds the foot press, and tells him that he has been sent by his sister Yara to rescue him. However, he must wait until nightfall when the castle is asleep, so he puts the bag back on and the desperate Theon is left alone crying for help.  In King's Landing King Joffrey Baratheon is being fitted for new clothes in his chambers, in preparation for his upcoming wedding to Margaery Tyrell. His mother Cersei begins to criticize Margaery, saying that she is only charitable to the poor to build up support for herself, and also saying that she thinks she dresses like a harlot. However, Joffrey barely tolerates his mother's chiding and dismissively tells her off.  Shae dresses Sansa Stark in her chambers, and warns Sansa about Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish. She points out that Baelish has offered to help Sansa for nothing in return, which probably means that he's after something. Sansa naively says that he's an old friend of her mother's, believing that should be reason enough. Shae suggests that Baelish is actually sexually attracted to Sansa. This disturbs Sansa, but she thinks it is simply impossible, as Baelish is so much older than her. Shae continues to warn Sansa that Baelish is manipulative and men usually only want \"one thing\" from pretty young ladies, and \"love\" often isn't what they're after. Sansa Confession Sansa warns the Tyrells that Joffrey is a monster.  Ser Loras Tyrell arrives at the door and escorts Sansa to the gardens to meet with Margaery and their grandmother, Lady Olenna Tyrell. Sansa reminds Loras that they met once before at the Tourney of the Hand, and he takes his leave after introducing her. Lady Olenna is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind, and bluntly says that her son Mace was a fool for supporting Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne, though Margaery speaks well of Renly. Lady Olenna insists that Sansa tell her the truth about what Joffrey is like, as he is to marry Margaery. Sansa is initially reluctant, but when Olenna mentions her father, Sansa breaks down and, her eyes blazing, angrily recounts how Joffrey had said he would show her father mercy, only to behead him in front of her, and how he then took her up to the wall and forced her to look at her father's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was \"mercy\". Realizing what she has just been saying, Sansa nervously attempts to backtrack. Olenna continues to prod Sansa as she fidgets around, and it becomes obvious that she is visibly afraid about being overheard. After enough times of Olenna insisting that she can trust her not to repeat what she says, Sansa blurts out that Joffrey is \"a monster\". Olenna is disappointed, but unsurprised, given the rumors that have been circulating about Joffrey's public outbursts. Sansa is worried that this means the Tyrells will cancel their proposed marriage alliance (meaning Sansa will be stuck with Joffrey again), but Olenna assures her that her son Mace is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything.  Shae sneaks into Tyrion Lannister's new chambers. He warns her that his father threatened to kill her if he found her with him again, and that his father follows through on such threats. Undeterred, Shae starts undressing Tyrion, and asks him for a favor; to protect Sansa from Baelish. Tyrion says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that, though Shae accuses him of being attracted to Sansa, which he cheerfully denies. It also comes out that Tyrion had sex with Ros back in the North, though Tyrion points out it was before he met Shae. They playfully bicker about it as they start having sex.  Jofrey Margery Bonding Margaery finds a way to bond with Joffrey.  Margaery is summoned to Joffrey's chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip. While Joffrey has previously been easy for Margaery to manipulate, Cersei was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind; the fact that Margaery was married to his uncle Renly (and thus, already had sex with another man), whom Cersei described as a \"traitor and known degenerate\". When questioned, Margaery says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty, but Joffrey implies that this still means he must have had sex with her. Joffrey angrily questions Margaery about the relationship and she delicately placates him by feigning demure shyness and painting herself as a dutiful, but frustrated, bride. She uses the rumors about Renly's homosexuality to redirect Joffrey's anger, stating that Renly always found excuses to avoid sex, but, in one instance, drunkenly suggested \"something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in children\", which draws her new fiance's sympathy. Joffrey tells Margaery he had considered making Renly's \"perversion\" punishable by death. Margaery eventually manages to divert attention to the new custom crossbow Joffrey's had made for his excursion. It quickly becomes apparent that Joffrey is excited by violence and sadism, so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself. Easily played, Joffrey offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something.  In the Riverlands King Robb Stark settles into the council chamber at Harrenhal with his wife Queen Talisa. Lord Roose Bolton interrupts them with two messenger-raven missives, each of which brings bad news. First, Robb's maternal grandfather Hoster Tully has finally died after a long illness at his castle of Riverrun. Second, Roose delivers a letter from his bastard son Ramsay Snow, stating that the ironborn torched Winterfell and put all of its inhabitants to the sword, and then fled all before his force arrived there. There has been no sighting of Bran or Rickon, and though Robb hopes that they are still alive, there is a strong possibility that they are dead. Moreover, there has been no word of Theon, and if he took the boys captive the Greyjoys haven't sent out any demands. This double-blow reduces Catelyn Stark to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years. She is horrified at the thought that Bran and Rickon were in danger while she was away and could not protect them, and are now likely dead.  Robb leaves Roose in command of Harrenhal with a detachment of the Northern army while Robb leads his main host back across the Riverlands to Riverrun. Lord Rickard Karstark angrily says that this is a waste of time, though Robb points out that Catelyn's brother and his uncle, Edmure Tully, is now lord of Riverrun and his levies will reinforce their army. Karstark maintains that unless Edmure has been breeding soldiers like rabbits, it will make no difference: with their new Tyrell allies, the Lannisters now outnumber them over two to one. Robb asks if Karstark has lost faith in their cause, and Karstark says he still believes in revenge. However, the fact that Robb lost his home castle makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen, and many no longer believe in Robb as they once did. Lord Karstark asks to speak his mind, and says that he thinks Robb lost the war the day he married Talisa, a political nobody, throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage-alliances with badly needed allies, specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage-alliance with House Frey.  Talisa notices that Catelyn is making a prayer wheel for the Faith of the Seven, and offers to help. Catelyn explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their children. Catelyn reveals that she has only made them twice before, one of which was when she was praying for Bran to wake from his coma, which worked after a fashion, as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs. Talisa asks after the other time, and Catelyn says that when they were younger, one of the boys had a pox, and Maester Luwin said that if he survived the night he would be all right, but that it would be a long night. Catelyn explains that the boy was Jon Snow, and at first the thought that Jon would conveniently die of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the Seven for his end. However, Catelyn then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing, particularly as Jon was an innocent child, and the person Catelyn really hated was Jon's unidentified mother. So she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night, praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that Jon would die, she promised she would urge Eddard to have Jon legitimized as a Stark and she would raise him as her own son. Jon recovered, however, Catelyn did not keep her promise. In grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her two youngest sons, and her continued grief at losing Eddard, Catelyn says the gods are punishing her misconduct with this war.  Arya - Dark Wings Dark Words Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are discovered by the Brotherhood without Banners.  Not too far away in the Riverlands, Arya Stark, Gendry, and Hot Pie are heading north from Harrenhal, planning to eventually reach the Red Fork of the Trident River and then follow it west to her grandfather's castle-seat at Riverrun. Off-screen, Arya explained to the boys how Jaqen H'ghar helped them escape because he offered that he would kill any three people she named. Gendry loudly criticizes Arya, in disbelief that she used up two of the names on minor Lannister guards when she could have said someone like \"King Joffrey\" or \"Tywin Lannister\" and ended the entire war, at which Arya gets quite defensive. However, as they advance in the forest, they run into a scouting party of the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of outlaws, whose leader Thoros of Myr they hear singing \"The Rains of Castamere\" as they approach. They recognize them as the group the Lannister torturers were asking about at Harrenhal. Thoros seems a friendly sort, and they make the children come with them. They later give them food and drink at a local inn. Gendry says he used to work as a smith in King's Landing for Tobho Mott, whom Thoros recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did; Gendry counters that's because it was double the quality. Arya insists that she knows how to use a sword despite Thoros' disbelief, but when she tries to mock-fence with him he quickly disarms her. Other members of the Brotherhood return to the inn with a captive; Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane. As Thoros trades insults with Sandor, Arya tries to leave, but the Hound stops her in astonishment and asks what in seven hells they're doing with \"the Stark bitch\", revealing her identity to all.  Finally, Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are slowly making their way across country through the Riverlands, heading to King's Landing intending to make the prisoner exchange for the Stark girls (really, just Sansa). Jaime continues to mock Brienne along the way. Brienne is wary enough not to let Jaime out of her sight, even insisting on keeping him on his leash and watching while he urinates so he doesn't slip away. Jaime deduces that Brienne isn't from the North because he would have noticed her at Winterfell when he visited there, so (as she is from House Tarth) she must be a Baratheon supporter. She angrily denies supporting Stannis, thus confirming that she served Renly. Jaime accurately deduces that she fancied Renly, but points out that Renly wasn't attracted to women so much as he was to Loras. Brienne says she doesn't want to hear his filthy lies, but he says that he knew Renly better than she did, reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the Red Keep, ever since Robert's Rebellion when Renly was just a child prancing down the halls. Jaime insists that Renly's homosexuality was actually \"the worst kept secret at court\" if she thinks he's lying. He continues to casually mock Renly which makes Brienne grab him, but he relents and says he doesn't particularly care that Renly loved Loras, as he feels people aren't free to choose the ones they love (which he knows better than most). They come across a farmer with a heavily laden mule, who notices that they're cutting cross-country and avoiding the major roads, and suspects that they're avoiding soldiers. Jaime tells Brienne that he suspects the man is a scout meant to intercept them, and even if he isn't he can still spread word he saw them. He urges her to kill the man, but she refuses.  Brienne Owns Jaime Brienne gives Jaime a beatdown  Later, the pair have to cross a river, which means they can either attempt a dangerous fording or take the bridge, which will probably be watched. Brienne takes the safer route of the bridge, but Jaime manages to distract her long enough to take away her spare sword and cut his bonds. Brienne and Jaime enter into an extended sword fight on the bridge. Jaime starts off very aggressively, putting Brienne on the defensive. However, Jaime's mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled, and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell. Jaime begins to tire, and Brienne wears him down further by making body-blows with kicks and punches. After a protracted fight Jaime finally slumps to the ground in exhaustion. Just then, riders from House Bolton arrive led by a man named Locke. Jaime asks if they want to negotiate, but Locke says they'll have his head if he doesn't bring the Kingslayer back to the King in the North, so there's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner."], "review": null}, "22": {"id": "s03e03", "name": "Walk of Punishment", "script": "This march is a distraction. My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction. - Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No. Then it's a distraction. - They're growing fast. - Not fast enough. I need an army. We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world. The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. - Who are you? - Thoros of Myr. - Who do you fight for? - The Brotherhood without Banners. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. - Your sister sent me. - Yara? I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father. I will not fail you again. - What's wrong with him? - He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us. Orell, where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men. - What did you see? - Dead crows. Get up, Tarly. I forbid you to die. You're responsible for him. Make sure he gets back alive. So good to see you again, Clegane. Girl. What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? Get up. Ah! Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want. Enough to buy me a new head? If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-- Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him \"nephew.\" He is your king. Robb knows I meant him no disr-- You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag. My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around. It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you. I seized an opportunity. What value was the mill? The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it. Is he there now? Of course not. We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us. I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill. We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister. Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old. Martyn is 15, I believe. Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace? No. Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons? No. How many men did you lose? But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-- We need our men more than Tywin needs his! I'm sorry. - I didn't know. - You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient. We seem to be running short of patience here. You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister. Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it. What news of Jaime? have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is? - We are trying, my lord. - Try harder. What do we have, then? Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, - in practice if not in name. - Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn. For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me. A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale. Titles do seem to breed titles. You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him. Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended. Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin. Master of Coin? It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents. I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it. I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge. Hear, hear.  He lifted her high in the air   He sniffed and roared and smelled her there   She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair   But he licked the honey from her hair   From there to here, from here to there   All black and brown and covered with hair   He smelled that girl in the summer air   The bear, the bear and the maiden fair  I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us. You were armed when we were taken. I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound. All my life I've been hearing, \"Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.\" You were slower than I expected. And more predictable. I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year. And I'm a woman. I was still beating you. You were not beating me. Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name. When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist. - Would I? - They'll knock your teeth out. You think I care about my teeth? No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter? - What does it matter? - Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly. If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted? If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods. If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new. Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart. Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend? You're not our prisoner, little lady. - What am I? - Our guest. No one's put any chains on you. So I can walk away, then? These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you. You think you're good with that bow, you little twat? Better than anyone you've ever met. A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him. Why? So you can kiss him? You remember the last time you were here? Looks like every other shit inn on the road. Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more. Watch your head. Off we go. Walk up! What are you doing? We're about to leave. I'm staying. You're what? I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of Winterhell. Winterfell. - You sure? - I'm sure. Well, I made you something. What is it? It's a wolf. Yes, it is. That's the tail? Yeah. Well, be safe. Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed. You don't burn your fingers. Good-bye, Hot Pie. Good-bye, Arry. Up you go, little lady. Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good. A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war. It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening. I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-- Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience. I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end? After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name. Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. \"Wait for me, little Cat,\" he'd say. \"Wait for me and I'll come back to you.\" And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again. You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him. You're Robb Stark's wife. Hold still. Is it true what they say about him? I don't know. What do they say about him? That he can turn into a wolf at night. True. And he eats the flesh of his enemies. True. You're a Lannister, aren't you? Martyn Lannister. Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear. Always the artists. It's only horses. No men. You said there was dead crows. There was. How many men were here? About 300. And you know what those men are now? We're all the same to them-- meat for their army. Do you think anyone got away? It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and 20 good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly. We're finally going to war, old friend? Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side. - We'll meet again. - Aye. - If you do your job. - Ah. How will we see your signal? Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen. Ghost? What have we here? Frozen crows? We've come a long way. Smaller flock than you went north with. We can talk inside. Oh, can we? They need some water. Tether it and I'll be inside. Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you. Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us. Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man. You are a godly man? I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods. Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast. Here we are. Sharpen these for me, would ya? I see the head. Push. That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it. What is it? What is it? Keep quiet. If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance. I can ride. You're sure? Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you. I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this. We're not in the Iron Islands. - Go. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on back. You refuse to tell me where you're going? I don't know yet. The fires will show me. - How long will you be gone? - I don't know. You're abandoning me. I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. - I am sworn to serve you. - Then serve me. When I return, you will understand. My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son. I cannot. Why? You don't have the strength. It would kill you. I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years. I want you. Your fires burn low, my king. There is another way. A better way. You told me your magic requires a king's blood. - Yes. - I'm the one true king. You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it. The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace. - To whom? - To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did. Give me your water. Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death. Here, drink. Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you. And what is she to do for soldiers? We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr. Is it \"we\" already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done. The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents. How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan? - Three. - Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands? I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead. Do you disagree, Ser Barristan? When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him. Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died. Did you know him well, Ser Barristan? I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met. I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon. All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace? They did not. I want to buy them all. _ _ _ _ There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all? Yes. 8,000. And the ones still in training as well. _ _ Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor. I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop. _ Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this. _ Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous. The gold you have left is worth 10. But good Master Kraznys will give you 20. The Dothraki you have with you-- _ The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them. _ Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining I have dragons. I'll give you one. You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace. Khaleesi, please. Three dragons. - One. - Two. One. They want the biggest one. - Done. - Done. I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck. _ _ Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army. Aegon Targaryen proved that. You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood? Do you have a name? This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace. Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice? No, Your Grace. No family living. You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth. Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less. I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? \"Let me die.\" There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace. Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience? All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it. And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed. Valar morghulis. Yes, all men must die. But we are not men. A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers. I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city. Not for bastards. That's all of them, my lord. Thank you, my dear. Pod. Pod. Take them outside. - I'll be there in a moment. - Yes, my lord. I hear you owe that boy a significant debt. Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid. You should have him knighted. If only the Master of Coin had such power. If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her. Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding. Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship. We don't. I did fuck her once. - I know. - But we don't. I know. But how would the queen get that idea? Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position? Keep a low profile. If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are. Well, you are richer than I am. Good point. They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores. I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie. Come on, I'm here later. Come on. Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading. You think all reading is dull reading. It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know. The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages. Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to. Unless he made it all up, yes. - Podrick, do keep up. - Yes, my lord. - Podrick. - Yes, my lord? After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman? - No, my lord. - Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers. She's not bad with second-timers, either. Uh, my lord A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say? Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me. He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome. Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot. My lord, I don't even She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as \"my lord.\" Be back in time for my supper. Pace yourself, lad. For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold. Let me guess. He's not a magician. No. - He's stealing it? - Worse, he's borrowing it. What's wrong with that? We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father. Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt. Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive. I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules. Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest. And what if I don't? Well, you have to. But what if I don't? This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back. Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step? The lad's practically skipping. You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth? Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year. He's a squire. You don't pay him. Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year. They wouldn't take it, my lord. Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin. Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them. What did you tell them? I didn't tell them anything. - What did you do to them? - Lots of things. And they seemed to like these things? Yes, my lord. Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it. Only they weren't paid. What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free? Is that what you're telling us? Sit down, Podrick. We're going to need details. Copious details. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Ha! Ha! You know how we deal with runaways here, do you? Take off his pants. No! No! No, no, no! I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt. No, please! No, no, no! No, don't! No, please! No! No! You little bastard. Come, my lord. You're a long way from home and winter is coming. I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off. My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing. Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you. You're only making it worse. Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy. Come on! You know who she is, don't you? A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big. She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth? I'm gonna cut your throat! They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. - The blue ones. - I know what they are. Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched. Bring her back here. Yes, my lord. - Get up. - Come on. Come on, on your feet. Unbesmirched. Not defiled. Fancy word for a fancy man. I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words. I bet you did. Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back? You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles-- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold. Aye, you have both. Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding. Hard to argue with that. Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once. None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree. Come on, men. Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat. I'm famished, actually. I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire. Well, I do like partridge. Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord? Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic-- ah! On the stump. You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots. - My father-- - And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say \"my father\" and that's it, all your troubles are gone. - Don't. - Have you got something to say? Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that. Here, this should help you remember.

Jon is taken to the Fist of the First Men. Daenerys meets with the slavers. Jaime strikes a deal with his captors.  Summary In Astapor In Astapor, Daenerys, accompanied by Ser Jorah Mormont and Ser Barristan Selmy, walks along a sea wall known as the \"Walk of Punishment.\" Here, any slave who showed insubordination of any type is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public, as a warning to all other slaves. Daenerys offers a condemned man water, but he refuses to drink, saying he just wants to die quickly.  Jorah and Barristan continue to disagree on whether or not Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied. Jorah insists that it is their only chance to get an army, but Barristan believes this is not the honorable way, as slavery is illegal and abhorred in the Seven Kingdoms. Jorah claims that not only will the slave soldiers be treated better in her service, but innocent people will also be spared in war because the Unsullied only do as they are ordered. They have no human or masculine urges in their bodies, and therefore will not kill civilians or rape innocent women, unlike most male soldiers who would succumb to those urges in the heat of battle. Barristan retorts that when her older brother Rhaegar led his army in the Battle of the Trident, men fought and died for Rhaegar because they believed in him, because they loved him - not because they were slave soldiers whose free will had been stripped away. Jorah responds that Rhaegar indeed fought honorably and nobly, but that in the end Rhaegar died. Daenerys was born months after Robert Baratheon killed Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, and only knew her cruel and half-mad brother Viserys, so she asks Ser Barristan if he knew Rhaegar. Selmy was a member of the Targaryen Kingsguard and thus knew Rhaegar well: he fought beside him and bled beside him at the Trident. Barristan says that Rhaegar was the finest man he ever met, the last dragon. Daenerys grows quiet and says she wishes she'd known her older brother, but that Rhaegar was not the last dragon (she is).  Dany GoodMasters3x03 Daenerys bargains with Kraznys for the Unsullied.  Daenerys speaks with Kraznys mo Nakloz, as he shows her his slave soldiers, the Unsullied. He repeatedly insults and mocks Daenerys in his native tongue, leaving his slave translator Missandei of Naath to clean up his crude and very insulting words into more respectful language. At one point, she pauses, wondering how to twist a particularly coarse insult from Kraznys, and Daenerys notices her reluctance to directly translate.  Daenerys says she will take all 8,000 Unsullied soldiers, including those in training. Kraznys laughs and retorts that she can barely afford 100 Unsullied. Daenerys surprises him by telling him she has dragons, and is willing to trade one. This offer stops Kraznys in his tracks, yet Daenerys repeatedly affirms that he may only have one of her dragons. They strike a deal that she may have all the Unsullied soldiers in exchange for her biggest dragon. Both Jorah and Selmy strongly object, and plead to Daenerys that while soldiers are valuable, it is dragons that will ultimately win her the Iron Throne. She ignores them, and concludes the deal with Kraznys, and also demands Missandei as a token of faith. Upon leaving the room, she scolds Jorah and Selmy, telling them that while she values their advice, they should never again question her in public.  Daenerys speaks with Missandei and asks her if she has a family; she says no. Daenerys tells her of the man who turned down her offer of water, and asks why he would simply say, \"Let me die.\" Missandei replies that in the afterlife, there is no master. Thus, the man would rather be dead than alive in the Slavers Bay. Daenerys proceeds to explain the dangers Missandei will be facing in Daenerys's service and asks if that will be a problem. Missandei simply replies, \"Valar morghulis\" (\"all men must die\"). Daenerys acknowledges the truth of the words, but quips, \"We are not men.\"  Beyond the Wall HorseCorpses 3x03 Horse carcasses specially arranged by the White Walkers.  The Free Folk army of King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, including Jon Snow, arrive at the Fist of the First Men. They survey the bloody aftermath of assault on the Night's Watch by the White Walkers and their army of undead wights. Mance grimly remarks that the White Walkers are \"always the artists\": the severed corpses of all of the Watch's horses have been carefully arranged into a large-scale, ceremonial spiral pattern. However, there is no sign of any human corpses - which Orell insists were there when he scouted ahead earlier by warging into his eagle, but have now vanished. Jon says that there were three hundred men of the Night's Watch at the Fist, and asks Mance if Mormont could still be alive. Mance says that with Mormont, it's possible he was able to escape, but that even if he did he and his men took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the Wall with the White Walkers in close pursuit. Mance warns Jon that all of the missing corpses from the Fist are no longer his friends and brothers from the Night's Watch, but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the White Walkers.  Mance orders Tormund to take a force of twenty men to scale The Wall to attack Castle Black from its exposed rear. The fortresses of the Night's Watch were purposefully built to only defend from attack over the Wall, without defenses on their southern sides, so they wouldn't be a threat to the lords of the Seven Kingdoms. Mance's plan is for Tormund's small band to distract Castle Black by attacking their exposed southern side, at which point Mance's main army will assault it from the north. Tormund will know that Mance is in position when his army makes a massive signal fire; Mance boasts that \"I'm going to make the biggest fire the North has ever seen!\" Mance orders Tormund to take Jon with him, as Jon knows the layout of Castle Black, and it will prove a key test of his loyalty: if it turns out that he won't really betray the Night's Watch, Tormund can easily throw him off the Wall to his death.  Farther south, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont leads the ragged survivors of the Night's Watch expedition to Craster's Keep. Craster mocks the survivors of the Battle of the Fist of the First Men when they reach his Keep. He initially wants to refuse them shelter until he notices some of them stroking their weapons. Fearful that in desperation they might try to rush him, he relents. As the black brothers warm by his hearth, Craster mocks them. Craster insists that the black brothers should be grateful for his generosity, and that he is a \"godly man\" for helping them. Mormont tensely questions Craster's claim to be a godly man, but Craster insists that he is - to the \"real gods,\" the White Walkers, who consume entire armies on their way to the Wall but will spare Craster for his loyalty. He admits that he's feeding his pigs better than them - as pigs are valuable to him - and half-seriously suggests to his guests that they should eat the fat Samwell Tarly. He is also annoyed by Gilly's loud wailing from birthing pains. Sam leaves the main house to a birthing hut where he witnesses Gilly giving birth with the aid of a few other women. To her horror, the baby is a boy. Sam and Gilly wordlessly realize that Craster will want to sacrifice him to the White Walkers.  At Riverrun Uncle Funeral Bow Ownage Brynden takes aim.  At Riverrun in the Riverlands, the castle-seat of House Tully, the funeral of the recently deceased Lord Hoster Tully is held on the banks of the Red Fork of the Trident River. King Robb Stark has arrived with the main force of the Northern army, and he helps launch his maternal grandfather's funeral boat, along with Hoster's younger brother Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully. Catelyn and Robb's new wife Queen Talisa look on with the assembled crowd of bannermen on the dock. Hoster's youngest child, Catelyn's younger brother Edmure Tully, attempts to light the funeral boat on fire with a flaming arrow but fails three times. Just as the boat is about to disappear around a bend of the river, Brynden pushes his nephew out of the way and skillfully makes the shot. Knowing his accuracy was true and the shot would hit the boat, the Blackfish turns around to walk away (dismissively showing up Edmure at the same time) as soon as he releases the arrow.  In Catelyn's old chamber in the castle, she mourns with her uncle Brynden over her father's death. She asks him if he made peace with his older brother, with whom he had been fighting for the past thirty years. Brynden explains that he did: on his deathbed Hoster told him to stop calling himself \"the Blackfish\" as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by Brynden to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother, and it wasn't very funny to begin with. Brynden emotionally joked back to his dying brother that people had been calling him \"Blackfish\" for so long that they'd practically forgotten his real name. Catelyn is happy that her uncle was able to make peace with her father before he passed, and is upset that she couldn't have been there. She reminisces that she watched from this window in her childhood whenever her father left, but now he won't be coming back. She tearfully wonders if her sons Bran and Rickon similarly watched at Winterfell for her return when she failed to arrive to save them. Brynden insists that neither he nor Robb have given up hope that the boys may be alive and in hiding, and urges her to be strong for Robb.  King Robb, Brynden, and Edmure confer in Riverrun's meeting room. The war is not going well for them. The Lannisters have defeated their enemies in the south and secured King's Landing from attack, as well as a marriage-alliance with House Tyrell. They have superior numbers, wealth, and strategic position. Edmure begins to speak of his recent victory at the Battle of Stone Mill, which pushed the Lannister army under Ser Gregor Clegane from the Riverlands. Robb and Brynden, however, are furious with Edmure: their grand strategy was to lure Tywin and Gregor's armies into the Westerlands, where they would be vulnerable, out of position, and unable to defend the capital against the Baratheons. Edmure's role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the Lannisters back west across the Red Fork of the Trident. Instead, by successfully attacking the Lannisters at Stone Mill, Edmure kept them penned in the Riverlands, and thus close enough to King's Landing that Tywin was able to rush to the defense of the city at the Battle of the Blackwater. The Starks' strategic position in the war has been ruined. Edmure insists that they took valuable captives in the battle, Willem and Martyn Lannister, but Robb angrily points out that he didn't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive. Considering that Tywin didn't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured, taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war. Edmure tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred men at Stone Mill and multiple Lannister soldiers died for every man they lost, at which Robb cuts him off and shouts that they need their men more than Tywin Lannister needs his (who already outnumber the Starks significantly). At this point, the Lannisters are in such a good strategic position that they can afford to be patient, and grind down Robb's forces through simple attrition.  In the prison cells at Riverrun, Queen Talisa bandages the minor wounds of Willem and Martyn Lannister. They are boys, only 14 and 15 years old. One of them asks if Robb really transforms into a wolf eats the flesh of his enemies. Talisa says yes - but that he does not eat the flesh of children, except during the full moon. She asks a guard if it's currently a full moon, and reassures the now terrified child that he is safe.  In King's Landing At King's Landing, Tywin Lannister calls the first meeting of the Small Council since he arrived in the city and assumed his position as Hand of the King. He has the meeting place changed to a room next to his own quarters in the Tower of the Hand, asserting his dominance. Tywin arrives early and has all of the council members called in at once. All of the seats are on one side of the table, as a non-verbal test to see how each of them reacts around him. Petyr Baelish ambitiously pushes his way past everyone else to be the one who sits closest to Tywin. Varys rolls his eyes at Littlefinger's naked ambition and lets him pass, content to sit in the second-closest seat (for now). Grand Maester Pycelle, who is most focused on survival by avoiding direct conflict, doesn't try to fight over a better seat with either of them, instead quietly taking the third seat away from Tywin. Tywin's daughter Cersei arrives to find the seats are all occupied, but not wanting to play that game and be relegated to a lowly position, she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at Tywin's right hand, opposite Littlefinger. Tyrion is the only one who even mildly stands up to Tywin's posturing, by not even trying to sit closest to Tywin: instead he takes a new chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite end of the table from his father.  Tywin is upset with the three advisors, noting that between them, they possess the greatest number of spies in the world, yet none of them can locate his son Jaime, even though the entire Northern army has heard of his escape. Tywin asks what news there is of the war, and Varys reports that Robb has taken the bulk of his army to Riverrun for his grandfather's funeral, while leaving Lord Roose Bolton in command of Harrenhal. Varys makes a jab at Littlefinger's recent, titular promotion as Lord of Harrenhal, noting that this makes Roose Bolton the current Lord of Harrenhal in practice if not in name. However, Tywin says that Roose can keep it, because the title alone is enough to give Littlefinger the social standing to be a suitor to Lady Lysa Arryn. Littlefinger states that they have known each other since childhood, and Lysa has always adored him, and thus she will soon remarry to him. Pycelle notes that this will make Littlefinger the acting Lord Paramount of the Vale, an even more important position (Baelish is even wearing a more expensive tunic than usual, laced with gold, to reflect his new status).  Tywin states that this will confirm that the Vale of Arryn, which has been neutral in the war up to now, will not support Robb Stark, who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies (other marriage alliances, with House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne, combined with the crushing of the Baratheons, have in turn secured the rest of southern Westeros under Lannister control). Tyrion points out that if Baelish departs for the Vale that leaves a vacancy on the Small Council, and Tywin reveals that he has appointed Tyrion as the new Master of Coin to replace him. While this may seem like giving Tyrion a position of relative power again, Tyrion quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance. With backhanded compliments, Cersei makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for.  After the meeting, Tyrion, Podrick Payne, and Ser Bronn drop by Littlefinger's office in his brothel, where he keeps his ledgers. Pod loads them all into a cart as Ros flirts with him. Littlefinger says it was the safest place to keep such records, but Tyrion notes that his brothel hasn't been the safest place for bastards. Baelish says he hopes Tyrion does well in the position, as he owes him for securing the release of Ros (after Cersei arrested her, mistaking her for Shae) but Tyrion says it was just a misunderstanding. Tyrion and Bronn then lead Pod into another room of the brothel, where Tyrion says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater: he has paid for Podrick (who has never had sex with a woman) to enjoy the services of not one, but three prostitutes: Marei, Genna, and a contortionist named Kayla (one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a \"Meereenese Knot\").  Later, Tyrion is reading through the financial records, and explains to Bronn that not all is as Baelish would like the court to think. Bronn asks if he thinks Littlefinger has been stealing to obtain the crown's money, but Tyrion says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it. Littlefinger always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere, but in reality the Iron Throne is heavily in debt, and Littlefinger procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks.  We need Details Tyrion is fascinated at Pod's ability to pleasure women.  In particular, much of their debt is owed to the Iron Bank of Braavos, the largest bank in the Free Cities. Tyrion warns Bronn that when debtors to the Iron Bank cannot repay their loans, the Iron Bank will first refuse to give out new loans, and ultimately support rebellions against them. Tyrion fears that if they can't repay the debt, the Iron Bank will eventually cut them off and start supporting Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon. Podrick then returns, with the money Tyrion gave him to pay the prostitutes. Tyrion is concerned that he lost heart and fled, but Pod innocently says he did \"all sorts of things\" with the prostitutes - they simply refused his offer of payment. Impressed that the women would provide their services for free, Tyrion and Bronn ask Pod to explain in detail what transpired, so they can take \"copious notes.\"  On Dragonstone At Dragonstone, King Stannis Baratheon speaks with Melisandre as she prepares to depart by boat. He is worried that his enemies think he is defeated and are laughing at him, and that now even she is abandoning him. She assures him that she still thinks he is the Lord's Chosen, but she must travel to an unknown location to obtain something vital for his cause. Stannis says that he wants her, and that he wants Joffrey and Robb dead, and asks her to make \"a son\" again with him (like the Shadow-creature she conjured to assassinate Renly). Melisandre says that she cannot: creating a shadow-creature drains some of the fire of a man's life-force, and she fears that creating another would kill Stannis. Over his protests, she explains that what she is seeking is even more powerful than a shadow-creature, and will change his fortunes in this war, but she needs a king's blood to do it. Stannis doesn't understand, but Melisandre implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king's blood as an offering to the Lord of Light. She can't kill Stannis himself to achieve this, but as she points out, \"There are others with your blood in their veins\" - any of his brother King Robert's bastard children who managed to survive the purge.  In the North Theon Rape Skinner S303 Theon is nearly raped by his torturer.  At an undisclosed location, Theon Greyjoy escapes from the dungeon with the help of a young man, who gives him a horse and tells him to ride east. Theon thanks him and says he'll make him a lord of the Iron Islands for this, but the boy says that they aren't in the Iron Islands now. Theon is later hunted down by his captors in a prolonged chase on horseback through the woods. Ultimately his pursuers split into two groups and trap Theon between them, and he is knocked off his horse with a flail. Theon's captors pin him to the ground, and pull down his pants: the leader declares that he intends to rape Theon as punishment for trying to run away. However, Theon's unidentified savior returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow, rescuing him at the last minute. In the Riverlands Wolf Cake Hot Pie tries to prove his loyalty to Arya through bread.  At the Inn at the Crossroads in the Riverlands, Arya Stark, Gendry, and Hot Pie are still in the company of the Brotherhood Without Banners, who are preparing to depart. Gendry has finished fixing a steel breastplate which Thoros puts on, and Arya asks why Gendry is helping them. Thoros says that they're not prisoners, it's just that the war-torn Riverlands aren't a safe place for Ned Stark's daughter. Arya notices that they are loading Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane into a prisoner cart, so she walks over and angrily asks him if he remembers the last time he was here, but he simply says all poor inns look the same. As they get ready to leave, Hot Pie explains that he isn't going with them: he baked some bread for the innkeeper, and as he was a baker's apprentice when he lived in King's Landing, the innkeeper thought it was the best bread they'd ever had, and offered him a job. This life of fighting and traveling isn't really for him, plus Thoros formally made a deal with the innkeeper to pay for the free meals they enjoyed with Hot Pie's services. Before they go, he gives Arya a present he made for her: a loaf of bread shaped like a direwolf, though Arya implies the tail looks like a head. Arya is a bit brusque but the three wish each other well as they depart, and as they are riding away Arya starts eating the wolf-bread, and turns back to shout to Hot Pie that it is very good.  Somewhere else in the Riverlands, Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth have been taken captive by Locke and a detachment of men from House Bolton. As they ride along, the men sing a rousing chorus of The Bear and the Maiden Fair. Tied up back to back on one of the horses, Jaime warns Brienne that when they make camp for the night, they will rape her, more than once, and that his honest advice is to give no resistance, and just think of Renly. They were only sent to capture Jaime, therefore Brienne means nothing to them, so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation. Brienne says she will fight even if they kill her, and Jaime agrees that if he were a woman, he would fight to the death before being raped, too.  Brienne Rape Beatdown Brienne is beaten down as the captors prepare to rape her.  Later that night Locke's men make camp, and do indeed drag Brienne kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang-rape her. Jaime is disgusted by this pointless brutality, so he points out to Locke that Brienne is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of Lord Selwyn of Tarth, the \"Sapphire Isle,\" and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires - provided that she is unharmed. Locke agrees and calls his men back before they are able to rape Brienne, and they tie her up to a tree again. Jaime tries to smooth-talk Locke once again with offers of how his father Tywin will make him extravagantly rich if he lets Jaime go.  Jaime&#039;s Hand gone Jaime loses his sword-hand.  Tiring of Jaime's frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the Lannister side, Locke decides to prove that Jaime's father will never deal with the likes of him. At first Locke has his men untie Jaime on the pretext of letting him go, but then his men hold him down on a chopping block while Locke grabs a carving knife, threatening to stab Jaime in the eye. Locke reasons that maiming Tywin's son will be the ultimate proof that the Lannisters would never deal with Locke, much less bribe him. Locke says that Jaime's father can't help him now, and \"this should help you remember!\" - as he swings down the carving knife and hacks off Jaime's sword-hand. For half a second, Jaime stares at his severed right hand in shock, before what just happened can register in his mind and then he begins to scream both in horror and agony."], "review": null}, "23": {"id": "s03e04", "name": "And Now His Watch is Ended", "script": "Why are you helping him?

I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still? I don't know. Do I? As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts. Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-- You do not possess at the moment. But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special. The sorcerer. Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it. When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling. Or the shit. They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it. And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling. Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day. We need to get out of here. When the Lord Commander says we go, we go. The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. - How'd that turn out for us? - He had no way of knowing. We do now. We know what's out there. Craster's been out here surviving. So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster? We're like the sons he never had. Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves. Shh, shh, shh. - You woke him. - I'm sorry. - He's beautiful. - Shh! He's beautiful. Does he have a name? - No. - Are you going to give him one? Why? Here. Gilly. You said to hold it for you until you came back. - You're back. - I wanted you to have it. I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you? I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time. You have to go after him. How? You know how. Brandon. Mother. How many times have I told you? - No climbing. - Mother, I need to find it. - It's here. It's calling me. - I want you to promise me. No more climbing. Promise me. Promise me! Promise me! - Mother! Mother! - Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me! Is he very large? No larger than usual, apparently. - And yet they said that he was-- - Extraordinary. The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men. We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple? What did he do to them? I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive. So what did they say? They said it was hard to describe. Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income? He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey. Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark? He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest. What makes you say so? - His shipboard inventory. - Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession. - Former profession. - Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out? Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin. Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls? He's not interested in them, my lord. How do you know? Because I'm one of his girls. Prodigies in odd places indeed. Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there. The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else. There aren't more than 700 people of any importance. No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats. Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried? Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre? Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history. - The tomb's just up here. - This is so exciting. You were married here, Your Grace? - Yes. - Must seem like only yesterday. Seems like a lifetime ago. Your husband, was he buried here as well? No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End. - Such a tragedy. - A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix. I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle. I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year. All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent. I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing. And yet the world belongs to them. A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind. The gods have seen fit to make it so. My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise. I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness. I couldn't agree more. Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you. Open the doors. Joffrey. Wait. - Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery! Bless you, Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery! - Margaery! - Long live Lady Margaery! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! Gods bless King Joffrey! How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there. - She sent you to save me? - Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment. Why would you risk your life for me? I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, \"That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.\" And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you. Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he? I-- I don't know, my lord. They-- they never told me much. My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them. Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father. What is it? I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place. What did he tell you to do? Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that. - He lorded it over you? - Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North. And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys. The Stark boys? Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud. Maybe it's not too late. It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down. Not everything, my lord. She's up here. - Yara. - Shh. Wait. I brought him back. He killed the others. What? No, I didn't. You can't! No, please stop! No! Put him back where he belongs. Eat. What are you doing? I'm dying. You can't die. You need to live to take revenge. I don't care about revenge. You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up. Misfor-- misfortune? You lost your hand. My sword hand. I was that hand. You have a taste-- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman. I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me? You wanted to speak to me? Yes, about Jaime. What about him? I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back. When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response? - You started a war. - And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir? Whatever you can. Whatever I can. - You're still here. - Yes. Why? Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy-- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations-- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children? All right. Contribute. The Tyrells are a problem. The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives. Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him. Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city. Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes. I will. Do you like it, Nana? Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. \"Growing strong.\" Ha! The dullest words of any house. \"Winter is coming!\" Now that's memorable. \"We do not sow.\" Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong-- ha, that strikes fear in the heart. Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong. My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence. The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me? A little obvious, perhaps. Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. - So? - Might I sit? No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out. You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark. Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? - She's an interesting girl. - Is she? No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood. She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being. Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too. I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still. Which is Sansa Stark? Neither. A babe in the woods. - I admired her father. - Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head? I could not help Lord Stark. - Perhaps I can help his daughter. - How? You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her. That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name. Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor. It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point. Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him. And why have you come to me with this matter? Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army? Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North. And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket. Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride? You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him. Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes. You are a clever man, Lord Varys. You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution. One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it? Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you. You haven't. We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself. What did you pray for? - I can't tell you. - Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. - And you? - I'm sorry, I just can't. My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me. Pig-face? That's ridiculous. I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink. So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague. - Porridge plague? - You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you diein agony. But that's awful. You're-- I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot. Don't say that. No, you're not. So what happened to Alanna? Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating. I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen. I want us to be friends, good friends. That would make me very happy. You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months. I-- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing. The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that? His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from-- where did he come from? Down White Harbor way. He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again. And now his watch has ended. And now his watch has ended. Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man. It wasn't his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death. Craster's got his daughters to feed. You on his side? We can't just show up and steal all his food. We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves. The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is. Never knew Bannen could smell so good. You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my 99th. You ever meet a man with 99 sons? And more daughters than I can count. - I'm glad for you. - Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone. As soon as our wounded are strong enough. Ah. They're as strong as they're gonna get. Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself. Whose throat you gonna cut, old man? Wait outside. It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat. My wives gave you bread. There's sawdust in the bread. You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow. I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away. I told you to wait outside. He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die. I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women! So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter? Enough! Out! I am a godly man. You're a stingy bastard! Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard. You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard. The gods will curse us for this. By all the laws-- There are no laws beyond the Wall. Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did. Unhand her. I shall have your head for this. - Quickly. Quickly. - What's happening? - I'm not going out there. - No, we have to go. Now! Follow me. I know the best way. Come on. Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights. Can I take this hood off yet? I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Halt! - What is it? - Blackstrap rum. Ugh! Not easy finding molasses in wartime. I'd have some. Let's go home. What is this place? Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling. You look like a bunch of swineherds. Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before. You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier? No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier. Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days. And I won't see them again. Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it. Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are Which of us is running? Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants? Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name. Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive. You're fighting for ghosts. That's what we are-- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear-- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon-- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down. You found god? Is that it? Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen. If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it. You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice. And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched. I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door. House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne. Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime? - Murder is a crime. - I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not. You murdered Mycah. The butcher's boy. My friend. He was 12 years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer. Aye, he was a bleeder. You don't deny killing this boy? I was Joffrey's sworn shield. - The boy attacked the prince. - That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away. Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes. You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat. So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here? Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight. The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price. And who knows? In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper. Is it done, then? They belong to me? It is done. You hold the whip.

Burn in hell! He will. But not today. Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know. There are four to a patrol-- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies. How often do these patrols go out? It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you. You'd like to know that. There are 19 castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned? Three. You sure of that? Which three? Castle Black. Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others? Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower. How many men remain in Castle Black? - 1,000. - Liar. What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground? He's no crow. Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us. I'm not afraid of you. I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat. We'll find out soon enough. I don't need you to protect me. Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt. - Give it back. - Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back. Ygritte! Ygritte! Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte! Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself. Ygritte. You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me. All of me. We shouldn't. We should. Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-- That thing you did with your mouth-- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South? I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all. Hmm. You seemed to like it. Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that? There's been no one else. Only you. A maid. You were a maid. I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid? What do you think? - Who was he? - Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth. Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-- I'm not done with you yet. How long's it been since you had a bath? Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever. I want my gold. It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over. Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves. We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you. Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass. You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty. - Not in the eyes of god. - You can't! Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make. Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet. Riders coming through! The Kingslayer. Down! On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer. Pick him up, Locke. You've lost a hand. No, my lord, he has it here. - Take this away. - Send it to his father? You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it. Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now. Thank you, my lord. Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later. Lord Bolton. Is there word from the capital? You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed. Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn. - Will I die? - No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off. Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain? The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow. I don't need my right hand to kill you. I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine. - Mmm. With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy. - No milk of the poppy. - There will be pain. - I'll scream. - Quite a bit of pain. I'll scream loudly. Lord Baelish. Your Grace. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. Of course, Your Grace. I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart. I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin? My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts. Myself, I often find them a hindrance. And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital. - I shall do my best. - Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark? I assure you that it will. Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern. - Pardon, my lady. - No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons? Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters. I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters? It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it. Naturally. It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used. What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding? - I understand that. - Good. But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense. And? And we're at war, Lady Olenna. Oh, I'd nearly forgotten. Yes, and maintaining supply lines-- I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 2,000 in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. 20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them. And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm. As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. - Wouldn't you say? - I would. And traditionally paid for by the royal family. I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis? - My lady-- - Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. - Is that sufficient? - Quite sufficient. Thank you. Very good, then. That's settled. Good day. Give me that. What are you doing? Just mending Lord Beric's armor. Why? I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood. Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet. The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood. You don't have to do this. I want to. They need good men. Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. - And then you-- - What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving. You just said you were serving Lord Beric. He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family. I can be your family. You wouldn't be my family. You'd be \"my lady.\" Willem. Willem! - Is this a rescue? - Lannister filth! Take him! Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-- Bring them in. Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires? Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance. Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-- Was strangled by the Kingslayer. - They were his kin. - They were boys! Look at them. Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I. My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason. It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy? Leave him. Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North? Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest. Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards. This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die. Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me! Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it. Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer? It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done. I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die. The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord. Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you. You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead. And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it. Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage. A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed. The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin-- Stark and Karstark. That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now. I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days. Kneel, my lord. Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word? Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine. Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me? At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home. I'm a hostage and you're selling me. Don't think of it that way. - But it is that way. - It is. - And it isn't. - More is than isn't. Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether. - So why don't you? - We need the gold. Do I frighten you, child? No. You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged. - I thought he killed you. - He did. But how? Thoros how many times have you brought me back? It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words. - How many times? - Five, I think. No, this makes six. Six. There was the first time-- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest. Then I was stabbed in the belly. Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side. Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye? Both. Fuckers couldn't decide. And the Hound makes six. Second time I've been killed by a Clegane. You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know. I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away. Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once. I don't think it works that way, child. He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him. I would. You're alive. Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors. I have prayed day and night for you to come to me. My lady. I meant to come sooner. - The battle-- - I know of your troubles, my king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. Yes, of course. You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. - You will be victorious. - I believed that once. You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known. Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned. - No. - I've wronged you. - I have shamed you. - You're doing god's work. You don't understand. The Red Woman-- the Lady Melisandre-- I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy. Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing. - That's not true. So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions. She's my daughter. I want to see her. You are a king. You don't need my permission.  Under the sea   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The birds have scales   And the fish take wing   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh  Shireen. Father! You've grown since I last saw you. Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win? No. Did the Onion Knight come back with you? He did. He fought bravely. He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital. He won't be visiting, child. Why not? He's my friend. Look. He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight. Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him. Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off. What are you doing here? I need a bath. Help me out of these rags. Now get out. There's another tub. This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub. Why should I care how you die? You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him. That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-- - Don't you mock me. - I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce. You need trust to have a truce. I trust you. There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for 17 years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire? Of course. The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city-- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. \"You can trust the Lannisters,\" he said. \"The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.\" So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. \"Burn them all,\" he said. \"Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.\" Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then? First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. \"Burn them all,\" he kept saying. \"Burn them all.\" I don't think he expected to die. He-- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me. If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark? Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? - By what right? - Help! Help! The Kingslayer! Jaime. My name is Jaime. Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight. Princess? Gods, what are you doing here? - Shh, you'll wake Bert. - Bert? He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot. Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. - If your father knew-- - He said you were a traitor. Are you? I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price. I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? - And the Targaryens built this castle. - Aye. - So they did. - You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more. Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me. Take it. I have more. My lady, I can't read the words. You can't? I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you. - No. No. No. - It's easy. It'll be fun. - Go. We can't. - Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells? I wouldn't know where to start. At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is \"An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.\" It was a bitch of a siege. Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke? The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his. Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle? Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. \"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.\" All I could think of was how badly I had to piss. In full plate metal for 16 hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots. Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings. - You swore an oath. - Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her? With all my heart. These are the ones? Yes, khaleesi. The officers. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut-- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are-- vermin. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ King Robert wanted her dead. Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen. I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him. - I didn't sit on the small council. - No? Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally-- Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion. He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics. Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over. - Mm-hmm. Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms. She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience. Which men do you have in mind? Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years. It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery. I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home. Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man. We both want her to rule. Am I wrong? You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions. If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride. You're not Lord Commander here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen. - Come to bed. - You were right. The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait. Don't let him. What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day. We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. - Wait out the winter. - Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children. Give them a new purpose. What? Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is. Here. And we're here. King's Landing-- What is it? I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not. And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them. Can you do it? I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry-- Walder Frey. He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly. Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here. And only one to let you go. Because it will please me. Squire! Well fought, ser. That was no fight. I don't know you. Olyver, if it please you. I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser. How did you know? Know what? That I wanted to. My lord I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion. They rarely do, in my experience. You have a good deal of experience, do you? With the husbands. That didn't take long. Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed. Is he? And who's the lucky girl? She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. - Strange, isn't it? - What is? It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different. Is it? Lady Margaery wears it that way. Many ladies wear it this way. I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon. You still want me to come with you? It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you? Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare. I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend. I do, Lord Baelish. - Petyr. - Petyr. If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay. We'll speak again when I return. You're late. What's she doing here? Our business concerns her, too. Sit. You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding. Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss. I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important. Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable. Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras. Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do. - Your jokes are not appreciated. - It wasn't my best, but-- I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me. Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother. The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells. The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them? There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib. And how do we do that? We find Sansa Stark a different husband. - Wonderful. - Yes, it is. You can't mean it. I can and I do. Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you. Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, - nor should it be yours. - She's a child! She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length. There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. - Surely you're capable of that. - And if I refuse? You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed. I was wed. Or don't you remember? Only too well. You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve. Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you. What do you mean? You'll marry Ser Loras. - I will not. - The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach. - No, I won't do it. - Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed. I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare. You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all. Father, don't make me do it again, please. Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.  It's always summer   Under the sea   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The birds have scales   And the fish take wing   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The rain is dry   And snow falls up   I know, I know   Oh, oh, oh   The stones crack open   The water burns   The shadows come to dance   My lord   The shadows come   To play   The shadows come to dance   My lord   The shadows come   To stay.", "summary": ["Plot The Hound is judged by the gods; Jaime is judged by men. Jon proves himself; Robb is betrayed. Tyrion learns the cost of weddings.  Summary Beyond the Wall Tormund warns Jon s3e5 Tormund warns Jon.  Jon Snow is with the group of twenty wildlings under the command of Tormund, who were sent ahead of the main army of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder to scale the Wall and attack Castle Black from behind. Jon and Ygritte are gathering firewood, when the warg Orell asks him about the defenses of the Night's Watch. Orell has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the Wall and he wants to know how frequent they are. Jon says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four, two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them, but that the frequency of their patrols often changes. Orell says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the Wall, but he wants to know how many are currently manned. Jon finds this very unpleasant, but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned. Apart from Castle Black (which even the wildlings know is manned), there is also Eastwatch-by-the-Sea at the extreme eastern end, and The Shadow Tower at the western end. Jon is then asked how many men currently garrison Castle Black. Jon is very reluctant to answer, but after being threatened by Orell, he gives an exaggerated number, saying there are one thousand men (this is a lie, as Castle Black only had six hundred men before the Great Ranging, and the garrison now is closer to three hundred). Tormund tells Jon that he likes him, but if he's lying to them, he'll rip his guts out through his throat. 305 Always take care of your lady fair Ygritte is caught off-guard when Jon begins performing oral sex on her.  Jon and Ygritte then walk away, but she steals his sword Longclaw, making him chase her to get it back. She leads him into a nearby cave, which is heated by natural hotsprings, which form a waterfall and a pool. Ygritte starts disrobing, and says that she wants to make sure Jon Snow has truly come over to the wildlings's side and broken his Night's Watch vows: by making him break his oath of celibacy with her. She quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked. Jon is very hesitant to break his vows, and very shy because he's never had sex before. Ygritte questions why he's still dressed, and they start kissing. Jon continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore \"You know nothing, Jon Sn--\" but stops mid-word as Jon starts performing oral sex on her.  Jon and Ygritte s3e5 Jon and Ygritte taking a bath after sex.  Some time after they finish having sex, they lie together in a naked embrace. Ygritte asks if \"that thing you did with your mouth\" is what Lords do to their Ladies in the south, but Jon says she just seemed to like it when he kissed her there. He admits he's never had sex with anyone before and is \"a maid\", according to Ygritte. Ygritte starts listing off some wildling boys she's had sex with before. The first was a boy who also had red hair like her, which is rare among the wildlings and considered very lucky: they call having red hair being \"kissed by fire\". Another was a Thenn that was \"built like a mammoth\", but he could not speak the Common Tongue. Jon and Ygritte then slide into the hot springs pool to take a bath together and they romantically cuddle more. Ygritte tells Jon she wishes they could stay in this cave forever instead of having to leave and face the winter, wars, and monsters outside.  In Slaver's Bay In Slaver's Bay, Daenerys Targaryen's new army of freed Unsullied, having just sacked Astapor, head north to the next of the three great slaver-cities, Yunkai. Ser Jorah Mormont tells Ser Barristan Selmy how he was knighted at the end of the Greyjoy Rebellion, in which they both fought. Jorah explains that he was the second man through the breach during the Siege of Pyke, right behind Thoros of Myr, who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword. Barristan thinks this is amusing as he wasn't there (he was commanding the Siege of Old Wyk at the time). King Robert Baratheon himself knighted Jorah for his bravery that day, the proudest of Jorah's life, though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight.  Barristan admits that Robert was a good man and a good warrior, but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king. Barristan is sorry that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who didn't deserve it. He spent seventeen years defending Robert, and the Mad King before that. Barristan explains that a man of honor must keep his vows no matter what, whether he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Barristan says that just once before he dies, he wants to know what it's like to serve with pride, fighting for someone he believes in.  Their talk turns to Daenerys, and Jorah says that Barristan can believe in her. Barristan says she'll have good men to advise her, though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with Jorah at her side when they return to Westeros; Jorah admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves, which is abhorred in Westeros. Jorah then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the Small Council, if any of them spoke against Robert when he wanted Daenerys, the last Targaryen, assassinated. It becomes apparent that Jorah is trying to figure out if Barristan knew that Jorah was initially a spy for King Robert, reporting back to Varys. Jorah's report that Daenerys was pregnant is what made Robert demand that Daenerys be assassinated at a Small Council meeting with Ned Stark. Jorah points out that the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally holds a seat on the Small Council. However, Barristan explains that as a former Kingsguard member under Aerys Targaryen, and one who'd killed several of Robert's friends, while Robert didn't mind keeping him in his position as a guard, he never really trusted his advice, so he left him out of Small Council meetings. Jorah is relieved that Barristan was therefore not present at any council meeting so he couldn't have learned that Jorah was sending it reports on Daenerys. Jorah and Barristan briefly bicker about the fact that Barristan only just came to them, while Jorah was defending Daenerys from Robert Baratheon's assassins for months, and Barristan isn't Lord Commander here; Jorah takes his orders from Daenerys.  Meanwhile, Daenerys and her translator/aide-de-camp Missandei meet with the assembled officers of the Unsullied. She addresses them in Low Valyrian, and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free men and they can make their own choices, and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the Unsullied. They part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward. She asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his name, and he introduces himself as \"Grey Worm\". Daenerys is confused, and Missandei explains that when the slavemasters of Astapor castrate slave-boys to train them as Unsullied, they force new slave-names onto them which are intentionally demeaning, usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin, i.e. \"Grey Worm\", \"Red Flea\", \"Black Rat\", etc. This is to enforce the mentality in the Unsullied that this is just what they are: worthless, expendable vermin. Disgusted, Daenerys issues the command that all Unsullied must choose their own new names as free men, or reclaim the names their parents gave them. The Unsullied commander says that he will continue to be known as \"Grey Worm\". His original name is accursed, because it was the name he had when he was taken as a slave, but \"Grey Worm\" is a lucky name he will bear with pride, because it is the name he had when he was set free by Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen. Daenerys is deeply touched by his loyalty.  In the Riverlands At Riverrun At Riverrun, the prisoners Martyn and Willem Lannister (squires fifteen and fourteen years old, respectively) awake to hear shouting and fighting outside the door to their cell. Lord Rickard Karstark fights his way into the room with some of his own men. A guard is killed while attempting to stop them. Confused, Willem asks if this is a rescue, and is promptly killed by the Karstark men. Martyn begs that he is just a squire and didn't do anything, but Lord Rickard ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger, killing him.  Martyn and Willem Lannister dead s3e5 Martyn and Willem lie dead before Robb.  The bloody corpses of the two Lannister prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of King in the North Robb Stark in Riverrun's main meeting room. Robb is disgusted, remarking that Karstark needed five men to brutally murder two unarmed squires in their own prison cell. Karstark insists that it was a father's vengeance. Robb points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of Karstark's sons, who were both killed by Jaime Lannister. Rickard explains that he was denied his vengeance when Robb's mother Catelyn set Jaime free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in King's Landing. Finally having enough, Karstark did the next best thing, and killed Jaime's kin who they held prisoner. Robb angrily shouts that they were only little boys, and Karstark can't blame Catelyn for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war. Karstark stands firm, and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go, when in war they should be killing them. He insults Robb by asking him if his father ever taught him that. Brynden Tully punches Karstark over this remark, but Robb tells him to leave Karstark alone. Karstark has utterly lost faith in Robb, and says that the King in the North will just give him a scolding, though he should probably call him \"the King Who Lost the North\" after he allowed Winterfell to fall. Robb orders all of Karstark's men hanged, and to hang the lookout last so he can watch the others die. Rickard Karstark himself is sent to the dungeons.  Robb's uncle Edmure Tully insists that if word of this leaves Riverrun, Tywin Lannister will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews. Therefore, he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys, and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over. Robb, however, refuses to be a liar; he says he cannot fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks. All of Robb's advisors tell him this is a bad idea. Catelyn and his wife Talisa warn him that the Karstark soldiers will abandon his cause and return home if he executes their lord, and they are already badly outnumbered. Catelyn says they should keep Lord Rickard hostage, and Edmure agrees, saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal.  Robb prepares to execute Rickard s3e5 Robb executes Rickard.  Robb ignores their pleas, and he has Lord Karstark brought out to the courtyard of Riverrun to be executed during a driving rainstorm. Karstark points out that not only are both of their Houses descended from the First Men, but the Starks and Karstarks are kin (as House Karstark is a cadet branch of House Stark, founded centuries ago by younger son Karlon Stark). Robb says that their blood relationship did not stop Rickard from betraying him and won't stop Robb from executing him now. Rickard says it isn't meant to stop Robb: he wants it to haunt Robb until the day he dies. With his last words, Lord Rickard says that Robb will be cursed as a kinslayer and that Robb is no king of his. Obedient to the laws of his father Eddard Stark who said that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword, Robb pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads Lord Rickard.  Robb's strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would: the Karstarks withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home. This results in Robb losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at Riverrun. Robb openly admits to Talisa that she was right, and he made a mistake. Robb says Tywin Lannister realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the Northerners anymore, he just needs to wait, and let their demoralized forces unravel. When the war began Robb's army was unified around a central purpose, but now they have lost momentum, and his generals are acting like bickering children. Robb shows Talisa a war map of the Seven Kingdoms which depict Robb's armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal, Lannister and Tyrell armies overrunning the Stormlands, Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King's Landing, and Greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the North. Talisa suggests that he try to take the fight to the Lannisters if they won't come to him, but he explains that this is hopeless. Taking King's Landing would have been difficult to begin with, but now Tywin and the bulk of the main Lannister army, as well as a large Tyrell army, are defending the city. Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide, and Tywin would crush them within a day. Talisa suggests that he lead his army back to the North to repulse the Greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase. Robb points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home, they won't want to leave again, particularly because \"winter is coming,\" and the coming one is expected to be very long, five years or more. The Northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war, however, so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles. Thus if Robb returns to the North, it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him. Eyeing the map with Talisa, Robb decides that if King's Landing is too strong to attack and he can't return home, his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest. Robb decides that with the main Lannister army-group under Tywin now positioned all the way to the east in King's Landing, he needs to return to the Westerlands and make an all-or-nothing assault against Casterly Rock. This will make the Lannisters lose face, just as Robb did when he lost his home castle of Winterfell, and bring momentum back to his army. However, with the loss of the Karstark forces, they don't currently have enough men to consider attacking Casterly Rock. The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if Robb can win back the allegiance of House Frey, whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from Robb's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying Talisa, a political nobody, instead of one of the Lord Walder Frey's daughters. Thus, Robb must try to repair his alliance with House Frey.  At Harrenhal Locke taunts Jaime s3e5 Locke taunting Jaime about his hand.  At Harrenhal, Locke presents the captive Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to the Northern castellan, Lord Roose Bolton. Locke is quite proud of himself for his torture of Jaime, but Roose is surprised that Jaime has lost his hand. Oblivious, Locke boasts that Jaime hasn't \"lost\" the hand, and points out that he cut it off and hung Jaime's own hand around his neck. Angered that Locke maimed such a valuable hostage, Bolton demands that he dispose of Jaime's rotting hand, and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners. When Jaime asks if there is news from the capital, Bolton informs him that Stannis Baratheon laid siege to the city in the Battle of the Blackwater... then needlessly drags out revealing the result. Bolton toys with Jaime but remains completely calm, never even grinning, before finally revealing that his sister Cersei is alive and well, and his father's forces successfully repulsed Stannis's assault. Jaime is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses. Bolton calls for Qyburn to attend to Jaime's injuries. Later, Qyburn peels away the crude tourniquet that Locke's men applied to Jaime, and finds that the stump of his right hand has become badly infected. Jaime asks if he will die, and Qyburn says he won't, but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder. Half-delirious from the infection, Jaime refuses, and says he'll kill Qyburn if he tries. Jaime then notices that Qyburn is not a Maester, because he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office. Qyburn acknowledges this, explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the Citadel and thrown out of the Order of Maesters, because as he says, he was conducting experiments which they felt were \"too bold.\" Qyburn gets ready to cut Jaime, and says he'll at least try to save his elbow, but with a sudden burst of effort Jaime grabs him around the throat with his left hand, and says he doesn't need his right hand to kill him. Qyburn relents, and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten, then burning out the wounds with boiling wine, and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of Jaime's arm above the wrist. Jaime says he's willing to try this, but Qyburn cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him Milk of the Poppy, but Jaime refuses to take it, and says he'll just scream. Qyburn cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain, but Jaime says that he will just scream loudly. Qyburn begins to dig into the stump of Jaime's arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue, and Jaime howls in agony.  Some time later, Brienne is in Harrenhal's bathhouse, scrubbing off weeks' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the Riverlands. Jaime then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant, barely able to stand due to the pain he is in. He asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave. Jaime then walks naked into the same communal bath that Brienne is in, on the far side. She is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths, but he says he wants this one; he's afraid he's going to pass out at any moment, and wants her to save him from drowning if he does, because he doesn't want to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub. Brienne asks why she should care how he dies, but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to King's Landing in one piece - which (indicating the stump of his hand) has not been going so well. Jaime quips that it's no wonder Renly died with Brienne guarding him, at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath, facing him fully nude, to show him she isn't afraid of him. Jaime gravely says that was \"unworthy\" and asks for forgiveness, Brienne angrily orders him not to mock her, but he insists he's seriously apologizing. Exhausted, Jaime says he's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce; Brienne says you need trust to have a truce, but he says he trusts her, so she sits back down.  Jaime recounts the past s3e5 Jaime recounts Aerys's madness.  Jaime then notes that Brienne has the same look on her face that he's seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years: people that despise him, call him \"kingslayer\" more than his own name, or \"oathbreaker\" and \"a man without honor.\" Jaime then goes on to recall the Mad King's obsession with wildfire, how Aerys enjoyed watching people being burned alive. Jaime recalls Aerys burned lords he didn't like, Hands who failed him, and anyone he thought was against him. Ultimately, half of Westeros rebelled against him, so Aerys had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over King's Landing: under the Great Sept of Baelor, under the slums of Flea Bottom, under houses, stables, taverns, and even under the Red Keep itself. After Robert's victory at the Trident he marched on the capital city, but Jaime's father Tywin arrived there first, leading the entire Lannister army, and promising to defend the city. Jaime warned Aerys that his father was never a man to choose the losing side, that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could, but the Mad King refused to listen. Nor did Aerys listen to Varys when he gave the same warning that Tywin couldn't be trusted - but he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, who convinced Aerys the Lannisters were there to help. Aerys opened the city gates, and the Lannisters proceeded to sack the city. Jaime again begged Aerys to surrender, but the Mad King ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin's head, and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze, burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire. Jaime makes it plain to Brienne that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious Renly commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people; she can only sit in shocked silence. Jaime goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer first, then drove his sword into Aerys's back as the Mad King tried to run for his life. Shaken at the memory, Jaime speculates that King Aerys didn't believe he would die in the blaze; in his lunacy, the Mad King believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire, granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes... so Jaime finished Aerys off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died, concluding that Eddard Stark found him at that point. Stunned, Brienne asks why Jaime didn't defend himself with this account before. Jaime angrily rants that the \"honorable\" Lord Stark would never have believed a word he said: Stark didn't want to hear Jaime's side of the story when he'd already judged him guilty.  Jaime faints in Brienne&#039;s arms s3e5 Jaime faints.  Jaime goes on to rage, yelling what right Stark had to judge him, by what right the wolf dares to judge the lion. The strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes Jaime, however, and he begins to faint, nearly falling face-first into the water. Brienne catches him and calls for help for the Kingslayer, at which (as he slips out of consciousness) he whimpers to himself \"Jaime. My name is Jaime...\"  At the Hideout of the Brotherhood Without Banners Beric vs. Clegane s3e5 The Hound vs Beric.  Elsewhere in the Riverlands, at the hideout of the Brotherhood Without Banners in Hollow Hill, Sandor Clegane prepares to fight Beric Dondarrion in a trial by combat. As both men prepare, Thoros of Myr prays to the Lord of Light to judge Sandor for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent. Before the fight begins, Beric calls upon the Lord of Light to ignite his sword with flame, using only his blood. Due to the Sandor's fear of fire, Beric initially has an advantage against the Hound. Beric even manages to set Sandor's wooden shield on fire, which is strapped so tightly to Sandor's arm that he cannot remove it and is nearly burned himself. Eventually, however, Sandor's raw physical strength and anger (born of terror) overpowers Beric, and with a single downward swipe, cuts right through his flaming sword, his armor, and deep into his shoulder, killing him.  Thoros reviving Beric s3e5 Thoros reviving Beric.  As Beric falls to the ground, Thoros quickly rushes to his side, and begins praying to the Lord of Light to revive him. Sandor falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield. Arya Stark grabs a dagger and attempts to kill the Hound while he is down, but she is stopped by Gendry. As she curses him, Sandor taunts Arya over how the god prefers him over her dead friend, however they are both interrupted by Beric, who has been revived by the Lord of Light's power. Having won the trial, and proven his innocence in the eyes of god, Sandor is allowed to leave. The Brotherhood had taken all of the gold Sandor had on him (to fund their cause), and in lieu of returning it, Beric gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war. Sandor scoffs at this and throws it to the ground, but Anguy says he should be thankful they're letting him leave with his life. Clegane is hooded so he won't know the way back to their hideout, then led away to be released some distance away.  After the fight, Gendry works on repairing Beric's armor, and Arya questions why, because they will be leaving soon. Gendry says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the Brotherhood Without Banners, to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war. Arya says that their plan was to find her brother Robb, and Robb needs soldiers too, but Gendry points out that he has no attachments to Robb Stark: Arya would be going to her noble-born family, and he'd just be serving another lord. Gendry says he's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it: he worked most of his life for Tobho Mott and he repaid Gendry by selling him to the Night's Watch (as soon as the secret payments from Varys ended), and he \"served\" Tywin Lannister as a prisoner at Harrenhal, every day afraid he'd be killed or tortured. He'd be serving in the Brotherhood too, but they chose Beric as their leader, and they're more like a family - and as a common-born tavern maiden's son who was orphaned at a young age, Gendry has never had a family. Arya sadly chokes out that she could be his family. In response, Gendry politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her, they'd never be family: he'd still be a commoner, and she'd be \"m'lady.\"  Later that night, Arya looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer-list for the death of her enemies. Thoros says that they plan to bring her to Riverrun to reunite her with her family, and in exchange for a reward from Robb to fund their cause. Arya points out that they are ransoming her, and Thoros admits they technically are, but this is different. They do intend to escort her safely through the war-ravaged countryside to her family, and Beric would like to return her for free out of memory of her father, but they really need the gold to support themselves. Beric says he knows she must be angry with him, but releasing Sandor was the right thing to do, as they'd promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat. Arya is still quietly upset, as she's now seen many honorable men keep their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it (such as Yoren and her own father). She wonders why Beric would want to let Sandor go when he nearly killed him, but Beric insists that he did actually kill him. When Arya asks how, Beric points her to Thoros to explain, but he says that he isn't the one who brings Beric back to life, it's the Lord of Light, and Thoros is just the \"lucky drunk\" who recites the prayers. Beric opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso: they explain that Beric has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now, counting his recent death in the trial by combat. He has been impaled on a lance, shot with an arrow, and at his fifth death the Lannisters hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye (which didn't heal when Thoros brought him back). Arya earnestly asks Thoros if he could bring back to life a man without a head. Thoros and Beric both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father, but Thoros says he doesn't think it works that way (both because he was decapitated, and because he's been dead for far too long by now). Beric consoles her that her father was a good man, but he wouldn't wish his resurrected life on him. Beric explains that being brought back from the dead carries a heavy toll, as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time. Arya still says she would wish Beric's life on her father, because at least Beric is still alive.  At Dragonstone At Dragonstone, King Stannis Baratheon is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, and doesn't have the daily support of the Red Priestess Melisandre since she left on what she claimed was an important mission. Most of Stannis' army has been destroyed, and the only reason the Lannisters haven't attacked Dragonstone yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at Blackwater that they cannot yet mount an amphibious assault. With little else to do, Stannis takes the time to visit his wife, Queen Selyse (who was born into House Florent), for the first time since returning from the battle. He finds her in her chamber, praying over a fire to the Lord of Light: Selyse is a fanatical believer in the Lord of Light religion, far more so than Stannis, and it was indeed Selyse who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone. Stannis and Selyse do not have a loving relationship, but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the Lord's Chosen. She tells him not to despair despite his defeat, and he will be victorious, but he laments that he used to believe that once. Due to his extreme belief in duty, (unlike his hedonistic brother Robert) Stannis is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to Selyse, when he had sex with Melisandre to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly. He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her, but she interrupts him and says Melisandre already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the Lord of Light can be a sin. Indeed, she wept for joy when Melisandre told her of this service she did for the Lord of Light with Stannis, and because the Red Priestess gave him a \"son\" (of sorts) which she never could. Stannis' face is filled with a mix of shock, disgust, and relief. Selyse had three sons with Stannis but they were all stillborn, and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars. The deaths of her \"sweet boys\" and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected Selyse, and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the Lord of Light. She weeps, and laments that she has given Stannis nothing - he does not blame her, and with pity he says that's not true. Selyse understands he is referring to their daughter and only child, Princess Shireen Baratheon. She grows annoyed when she realizes he's come to see her too, and says he shouldn't waste time on such distractions, but insists that she is his daughter, and she relents because it is not her place to question her king.  Shireen visits Davos Kissed by Fire Shireen visits Davos while in the dungeons.  Shireen is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself, and is excited to see her father. She is a cheerful but sickly young girl (about the same age as Arya Stark), with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded Greyscale disease. Stannis wanted to see his daughter, but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her. She says she heard he was in a battle and asks if he won, and he good-naturedly says no. Shireen is slightly let-down, but asks if the Onion Knight came back as well: Ser Davos Seaworth has been her friend during his service to her father, and he even made her a toy ship. Growing tense over their falling out, Stannis briefly explains that Ser Davos is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon. Confused, he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind.  Later that night, Shireen sneaks down to the dungeon of Dragonstone and finds the cell of \"Ser Onion Knight.\" He wakes up and tells her she shouldn't be there, but she explains that the fat guard Bert is on duty, who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his watch. She asks if it is true that he is a traitor, and he says that it is, as he disobeyed her father. She says she doesn't care, he's her friend. She was worried that he must get bored down in his cell, so she brought him a book to read, about Aegon the Conquer and his dragons - she excitedly points out that the Targaryens built Dragonstone, and Aegon used to live in this very castle. Davos reluctantly explains that it's wasted on him, because he doesn't know how to read. Undaunted, Shireen offers to teach him how to read, by coming down to his cell and reading to him when Bert is on duty. Davos chides her that they can't, but she asks what's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out, lock them in cells? They have a quiet laugh, and Shireen starts to read to Davos An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.  In King's Landing In King's Landing, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister encounters Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish in a courtyard, and tells him she fears that the Tyrells do not have the Lannisters' best interests at heart, but her father won't listen. Therefore, she asks that Littlefinger use his spies to try to find out what they're up to, because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the Lannister-Tyrell alliance. He agrees, but Cersei warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find Arya Stark, but the girl could not be found.  In the castle gardens, Sansa Stark and Margaery Tyrell watch her brother Ser Loras spar with his squire. Sansa confidently remarks on his fighting ability, and inquires when she and Loras will wed, as per the Tyrell plot to keep her out of the hands of Baelish and/or the Lannisters. Margaery replies that she will \"plant the seed\" of the idea after she and Joffrey are married. Sansa is skeptical Joffrey will let her go but Margaery is confident he will do it to please her, once she is his wife. After the match, Ser Loras' new squire Olyvar flirts with him, which leads to them having sex back in Loras' chambers. As they finish, Loras mentions that he is engaged to be married... a fact that Olyvar passes on to his real master, Littlefinger, so he can pass the information on to Cersei. Olyvar kissed by fire Loras and Olyvar  A short time later, Littlefinger meets with Sansa, offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the Vale of Arryn. Sansa practices lying for a change, and tells him that they should wait until after Joffrey's wedding, primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails. A master manipulator, Littlefinger is clearly suspicious of her motives, but doesn't press the matter for the moment. Instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety, and insists that she call him \"Petyr.\"  At the same time, Tyrion Lannister is engaged in a meeting with Lady Olenna Tyrell; with the upcoming royal wedding shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair, Tyrion is concerned about the cost. Olenna points out that the Tyrells have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort, as well as the coming winter. Olenna is bored to discuss financial matters, but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the Tyrells are supplying to aid the crown, demonstrating that Tyrion doesn't need to lecture her about wartime expenses. She insists that the royal wedding must go on as planned, as it will do much to improve the city's morale and keep the people happy, otherwise they will start blaming the Lannisters for the war again. Tyrion cannot outmaneuver Olenna, but in the end she decides on her own that she won't have it said House Tyrell isn't doing its part to help, so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities, for which Tyrion is grateful.  Tyrion heads to the Small Council chamber to report success to his father Tywin, only to find Cersei present as well, much to his annoyance. Tywin explains that the Tyrells are plotting to wed Sansa to Ser Loras and states that he will not allow them to steal \"the key to the north\" out from under him. Tyrion questions how Sansa is the key to the North, given that her older brother is still alive. Tywin explains that the desertion of the Karstarks have cost Robb Stark half his army, and (combined with already being badly outnumbered by the Lannister-Tyrell alliance) his days are now numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered Robb's younger brothers at Winterfell, which makes Sansa Robb's heir: if he dies, rule of Winterfell and the North goes to her and any man she marries... which Tywin has no intention of letting the Tyrells get their hands on. Tyrion questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match, but Tywin points out that as a plot against them, the Tyrells' plan is, by definition, a secret, thus the Lannisters can't be said to be \"refusing\" them something which they aren't officially trying to do. He also notes that the Tyrells won't go through with their plan until after Joffrey's wedding, which means they need to act first... namely by finding Sansa another husband.  After a moment, Tyrion realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him. Tyrion tries to protest, pointing out that Joffrey has made Sansa's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force Tyrion on her after she has finally escaped Joffrey is cruel, even by Tywin's standards. Tywin questions if Tyrion plans to mistreat Sansa and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl's happiness and neither should his son. Tyrion protests that Sansa is a child, but Cersei counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children. Tyrion flatly refuses, but Tywin points out that recently he was complaining that he wasn't rewarded for his actions in the Battle of the Blackwater, and as heiress to the North, Sansa is a far better reward than he could expect, and in any case, it is long past time Tyrion was wed. Angered, Tyrion snarls that he was wed, referring to his past marriage to Tysha, sarcastically asking if his father has forgotten that. Tywin returns his son's hateful glare and growls back that he remembers all too well.  Tywin Kissed by Fire Tywin arranges some marriages.  Cersei gloats over the matter, but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed Ser Loras instead. Cersei flatly refuses, but Tywin is insistent: the marriages of Cersei and Tyrion will place the North and the Reach firmly in the Lannisters' control. Tywin points out that Cersei is still fertile: she needs to marry and \"breed.\" When Cersei protests she is Queen Regent and not a brood mare, Tywin angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told: she will marry Loras and in so doing, put an end to what Tywin calls \"the disgusting rumors\" Stannis has been spreading about her and Jaime. Cersei switches to earnestly begging him, calling him \"father\" and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a second time (after her long and loveless marriage with King Robert). Tywin refuses to listen and storms out in disgust, raging that the pair have disgraced the Lannister name for far too long. Cersei slowly shifts her gaze toward Tyrion to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament."], "review": null}, "25": {"id": "s03e06", "name": "The Climb", "script": "The raven brings the sight.

Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall? You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth. - Stop it! - Hodor. You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it. Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground. You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back. Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat. First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace. Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine. - I said so, didn't I? - Osha! You're a good little hunter. Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you. Don't push me. Shh. I'm right here with you. What's happening? I'm right here with you. What's wrong with him? The visions take their toll. He's having one now? I saw Jon Snow. You saw him? At Castle Black? He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies. Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes. Your flock gets smaller every year. You ever climbed it before? No. But Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid. - Aren't you? - Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good. You kill someone for them? Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised. He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue. Can we not talk about that here? \"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.\" Did I seem scared the other day? You were trembling like a leaf. Only in the beginning. Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. What secret? Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent. But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down. It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me. I won't. 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck. Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers. Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. You're good. You're not as good as you think you are. Face, tits, balls-- I hit 'em right where I wanted to. Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position. Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold. - What? - Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold. But I have to aim. Never aim. Never aim? Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye. There's someone out there. That's about far enough. We come as friends. Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that. Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris. My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady? Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. How many times has the Lord brought him back? Six. I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him. You've been to the other side. The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason. You have someone He needs. Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at 200 yards. Can you make 'em? Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel. I'll get you the steel. Come on. I don't like that woman. That's 'cause you're a girl. What does that have to do with anything? Forgive me, lad. What are you doing? Let go of him. - Tell them to stop. - Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them! We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy. Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she? You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold. We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold. You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you. You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall. You're a witch. You're going to hurt him. I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me-- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again. You staring at my ass, Jon Snow? You all right? Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad. Sorry. Were you sleeping? Wa-- Wa--? Wa--? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you. So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least? - Please. - Please is not a body part. I'll tell you everything, please. But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you. Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that. You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger. If I win, you'll let me go? If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention. Please. You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we? - The North. - Too vague. Deepwood Motte. Terrible guess. Now, where? Last Hearth. Do I look like a fucking Umber to you? Karhold! Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in? No. It was just a guess. Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I? Torrhen Karstark. He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer. He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark. - You swore to tell me if I-- - You're right. Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me. Yes. You win. Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar. I'm afraid I am. Everything I told you is a lie. This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason-- I enjoy it. Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off! I win. Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times. The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come. Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters. Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong. As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands. - I don't think that's-- - We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it. And there's something else. We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs. Not what, whom. What? No. Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters-- Roslin. How old is she? Could I see her first? You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end. Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war? Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband. And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements. He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it. Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord. He's a proud man and we've wounded him. I didn't wound him. My answer is no. Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-- The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry. The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth. It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead. He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing. You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife? I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill. You recall that heroic engagement? I had something less permanent in mind. I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost. I'll marry her. You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it. I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear. Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing. When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason. I should send you back to Robb Stark. You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be? Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you. We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution. You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies. It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it. King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else. He'll make time for you. As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming. - Shall we drink on it? - I don't partake. You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people? Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident. Oh, she won't be going with you. I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-- You are charged with abetting treason. I'm afraid I must insist. You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position. - Impossible. - Why? My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. - Your daughter-- - Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king. Old. Old? Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely. The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. - Do you deny them? - Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through. And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name. Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys? Of course. And you never No. Not once? Not in any way? Never. I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets. Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior. I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters-- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out. I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it. Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation. I don't care what people believe. And neither do you. As an authority on myself, I must disagree. Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt. And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take. The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you. If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. - He will never have children. - Oh The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery. You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you? I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage? It's a rare enough thing-- a man who lives up to his reputation. No! We've gotta cut them loose! No! Take my hand! That's a wonderful pin. Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so I'm very happy about Uh, yes. I-I am as well. I feel like I'm in a dream. Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady? No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place. It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is. I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this. We can have them both killed. It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery. Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together. On a boat you built. The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family. I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it. I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate. Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater? The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot. What do you want me to say? I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger. Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here. Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister. Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands. You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels. When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere. Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked. Who's going to tell her? Do you think people will like it? I don't think they will even notice it. You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade. I'm sure he does. Will they let me invite my family? They haven't asked my opinion. But do you think they will? No. Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. - Should I-- - I beg your pardon, my lady. Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding. Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa. Of course. Alone, if I may. Why do you need to speak to her alone? Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to. Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances. It's all right, really. How to begin? It's-- this-- this-- this is awkward. taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread. There aren't There aren't even 200. I've counted. Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice. Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want. Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then? You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience. I did what I did for the good of the realm. The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie. But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all. Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love.

Robb weighs a compromise to repair his alliance with House Frey. Roose Bolton decides what to do with Jaime Lannister. Jon, Ygritte and the Wildlings face a daunting climb.  Summary In King's Landing In King's Landing, Lord Tywin Lannister meets with Lady Olenna Tyrell to discuss having Ser Loras marry his daughter, Cersei. They trade barbs about Cersei's age, her capability to have more children, and accusations of incest with Jaime, as well as Loras's well-known homosexuality. Tywin is adamant that Cersei, whom he calls the Kingdom's most beautiful woman, should marry Loras, the Kingdom's most handsome and desired bachelor, but Olenna blatantly refuses to consent, hinting that Joffrey is the result of incest. Tywin replies that if that is true, he has no right to the throne and the Tyrells just \"threw a flower into the dirt\". Olenna says she will not risk \"throwing another flower into the dirt\" if Cersei cannot bear heirs for the Tyrells. Realizing her unchanged position on the matter, Tywin threatens to make Loras a knight of the Kingsguard, which would force Loras to give up his right to marriage and to inherit Highgarden. Olenna relents, and consents to the marriage of Loras and Cersei.  In the gardens, Sansa Stark tries to get closer to Loras by discussing their hopefully impending wedding. Loras is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her, but brightens when discussing the lavish wedding he's had planned \u2013 although Sansa, for once, becomes suspicious when she realizes that Loras seems more excited by the food and the wedding joust than by her. Loras quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the wedding gown he's envisioned for her. Sansa says she's looking forward to seeing Highgarden, as she's only ever lived in Winterfell and can't wait to leave King's Landing. In this, Loras finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the Red Keep is \"the most terrible place there is\".  Cersei and Tyrion Lannister observe the couple from Cersei's chambers overlooking the garden. Tyrion sarcastically asks which of the four of them has it the worst. He then finally accuses his sister of trying to have him killed during the Battle of the Blackwater. Cersei, tired of fighting him, remains quiet while he deduces that only two people can command the Kingsguard. Tyrion realizes that while Cersei certainly has the authority to command a Kingsguard, she isn't stupid enough to command Ser Mandon Moore to kill him in public. Tyrion realizes that it was in fact Joffrey who ordered Ser Mandon Moore to kill him, because Tyrion was the only one who stood up to him. Cersei tells him his life is not in danger from Joffrey, as he dare not try anything like that now that Tywin is the Hand. They discuss about Jaime's possible return to King's Landing, with Cersei wondering where he could possibly be. She asks Tyrion which one of them should be the one to break the news to Sansa.  Tyrion decides he might as well dash Sansa's hopes sooner rather than later. He goes to Sansa's chamber and asks for a private word, but Sansa declines to dismiss Shae. Tyrion gives Shae a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to Sansa.  Later on, Lord Varys finds Lord Petyr Baelish in the throne room. Varys and Baelish discuss the Iron Throne and the pageantry and propaganda that creates nations and cements dynasties. Varys asserts that he serves the realm, but Baelish scoffs that \"the realm\" is an invention of Aegon the Conqueror. Baelish tells Varys that he is aware of Varys' arrangement with Ros, and that he has given her to \"a friend\" who is eager for a new experience. Baelish revels in the chaos that he has caused, likening chaos to a ladder (for those brave enough to climb) rather than a pit to be lost in, as Varys and everyone else sees it.  Ros murdered S3E6 Joffrey kills Ros  Elsewhere, Sansa weeps as Baelish's ship departs, both of her plans to leave King's Landing in tatters. Meanwhile, Joffrey coldly contemplates Ros's quarrel-ridden corpse.  In the Riverlands Anguy teaching Arya S3E6 Anguy teaching Arya how to shoot a bow better.  In the Riverlands, the hideout of the Brotherhood without Banners outside of Hollow Hill, Anguy trains Arya Stark with a bow. Arya spots someone behind her target, which is revealed to be Melisandre and a small group of Stannis Baratheon's men. She speaks to Thoros in High Valyrian, demanding to know what became of his mission to convert Robert Baratheon to the worship of the Lord of Light. He bluntly tells her he failed. Melisandre is brought to the Brotherhood's hideout and is shocked when she learns of the six deaths of Beric Dondarrion, exclaiming that Thoros should not have that kind of power. Thoros counters that he has no power, he only asks for favors and the Lord of Light sees fit to grant them. The priestess seems troubled by his response (or perhaps by the fact that the Lord of Light looks favorably on causes other than her own). Melisandre says the Brotherhood has someone the Lord of Light needs, and soon after has her men take Gendry into her custody. Arya protests, particularly when she sees that Melisandre has given the Brotherhood two heavy sacks of gold in exchange. She confronts the red priestess, calling her a witch. Melisandre ignores the barb and looks into Arya's eyes. She sees many other eyes, of many other colors- eyes that Arya will shut forever. Melisandre abruptly tells her that they will meet again.  Edmure Tully and Robb argue S3E6 Edmure is enraged at having to marry Roslin  At Riverrun, King Robb Stark and his advisors meet with \"Black Walder\" and Lothar Frey to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on Casterly Rock. The Freys carry Walder Frey's demands for an alliance, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle Harrenhal and all of its lands and incomes, and for Edmure Tully to marry Roslin, one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement.  Jaime and Bolton make plans S3E6 Jaime and Bolton discuss Jaime's release.  At Harrenhal, Lord Roose Bolton has dinner with Jaime and Brienne of Tarth. Bolton tells Jaime he will send him to King's Landing as restitution for his lost hand but only on the condition that Jaime swear to tell his father that Bolton was not personally responsible for maiming him. Jaime assumes that Brienne will accompany him, but Bolton intends to keep her with him, under arrest for abetting treason.  In the North In the North, tensions rise at camp between Osha and Meera Reed before Bran Stark diffuses the situation.

The boy threatens to remove Theon's pinky finger if he cannot guess the boy's true identity and their current location. He gives the impression that Theon guessed right when Theon says he is the younger brother of Torrhen Karstark, Rickard Karstark's son, and that they are in Karhold. But then, the boy tells Theon he was lying, and begins flaying Theon's finger while telling him that he is torturing Theon only for his own amusement.

Ygritte and Jon hang precariously by their safety rope. Orell decides that Tormund cannot continue climbing with the weight of Jon and Ygritte's bodies pulling them down and begins cutting the rope. Jon sees what Orell is doing and barely manages to swing to his left and plant a hook in the ice, saving himself and Ygritte. They reach the top of the wall, and Ygritte is awed by the view beyond the wall and to the south, before she and Jon share a passionate kiss."], "review": null}, "26": {"id": "s03e07", "name": "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", "script": "Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met.

And you will swear to tell your father that I had nothing to do with your maiming. - My lady. - She won't be going with you. Let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?

When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming. No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming. You know nothing, Jon Snow. She's right, you don't. I know you cut me loose on the Wall. Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are. And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird? People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her. That rain will cost us another day. Frey will wait. He knows we're coming. Lord Walder is prickly by nature. Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met. - Yes, and that is why-- - I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen. I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits. Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight. He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted. He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted. Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep. If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again. Attack. Attack. Who are you writing? My mother. - Is that Valyrian? - Gaaa. Gaaa? Say hello for me. Rytsas. \"Ritsas.\" That was close enough. Does she know her daughter's a queen? Not yet. That will be a surprise, I expect. Many surprises for her. How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that? Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over? I will. I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild. What, now? Are you certain? Are you angry with me? Angry? You're my queen. And I have your little prince or princess inside me. Maybe one of each. Don't get greedy. Can you leave the war for one night? I love you. Do you hear me? I love you. Most men fuck like dogs. No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. Come on! Hey, come on. You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle? No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks. I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls. What, you're jealous? Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own. And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth. You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him? 'Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy? Don't touch me. You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is. Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark-- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns. Come on. Come walk with me. I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother. You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances. How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him. - Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you? - No. Has he been kind to you? He's tried. You don't want him, though. He's a Lannister. Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say? I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you My son will be king. Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What? My son with him. I'll have to-- we'll have to-- If it's the pain you're worried about-- I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me. What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar. He's a dwarf. And Loras-- Loras. Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced. And that's a good thing? It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice. How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you? Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me. She's a child. She's a foot taller than you. A tall child. What's the youngest you've ever had? Not that young. How much older? Older. You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem. Shae isn't going to like it. Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time? I should never have told you about that. You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own. Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them. You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it. I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company. You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free. Your Grace. Grandfather. You wanted to speak to me? Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council. You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them. I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention. Of course. You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber. I have, yes. May I ask why? The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively. So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand? We could arrange to have you carried. Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons. Where did you hear about this? Is it true? Apparently so. Don't you think we ought to do something about it? When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple. And the biggest was the size of a carriage. Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us. But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel? Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing. But I haven't been counseled. You are being counseled at this very moment. I should be consulted about such things. From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace. Yunkai. The Yellow City. The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them. On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man. I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea. We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne. How many slaves are there in Yunkai? if not more. Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city. Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace. Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons. You may approach. Sit. Will the noble lord take refreshment? Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi. Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early. If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people. The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen. There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship. - My ship? - Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require. And what do you ask in return? All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace. I have a gift for you as well. - Your life. - My life? And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy. You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well. You swore me safe conduct. I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother. Take the gold. My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out. The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend. And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about? I don't know. Find out. Chains? Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock. Golden chains. You could buy a ship with these. - Do I need a ship? - What? - Am I going somewhere? - Of course you're not going anywhere. So, am I invited to your wedding? I didn't ask for this marriage. - I didn't want it. - No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself. That doesn't mean that-- this is duty, not desire. Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her? I don't have a choice. My father-- Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea. What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock. And I'm Shae the funny whore. My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her. While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored? I swear to you it will not be like that. No? What will it be like? I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for. Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them? Listen. Listen to me, my lady. - I'm not your lady. - You are. You'll always be my lady. I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing. - What happened? - Wildfire. I should have been here. After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started. Do you miss it? - King's Landing? - Your father's house. Never had a father. Never wanted one. Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting? I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench. Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up. I was born in Flea Bottom. Your blood is noble. Are you saying my father, he was some lord or There. Your father's house. I'm just a bastard. The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood. Come sit by the fire, child. Not talking, eh? That's a first. I don't talk to traitors. I didn't like giving up the boy. But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up. The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey. He's not my one true god. No? Who's yours? Death. Spotted a Lannister raiding party. - How many? - No more than 20. - How far? - Less than a day's ride south. What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt? Yeah! But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here. It will still be west of here two days from now. - You swore. - To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first. Why? So you can steal their gold? I swear to you, this isn't-- I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all. One day you'll understand, but now-- - Anguy, bring her back. - Come back, girl! Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good. I thought you were gone. Tomorrow. Have they told you what they plan to do with me? Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here. With Locke? I owe you a debt. When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid. I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it. Good-bye, Ser Jaime. Here. Let me. It will take time. Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain. My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand. You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust? Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards. Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her. Shh. Gentle, my lord. Gentle. Shh shh shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only she had other urges. So did the septons, only they lied about it. Where is he? Who, my lord? There's no one here but you, me, and Violet. Please. Don't you want us to see it? Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it. He sent you. Who sent us? We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy. We heard so much about it. - Please. - Oh! There it is. Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly. Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face. Help me. If he comes back We need to make him feel better. And how can we make him feel better? I have an idea. Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls. Maybe he doesn't know how we are. Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy. - As good as they say? - Mmm. And why should you get all the fun? What? You like her better? Plenty there for both of us. I was here first. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing. But I was getting jealous. Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about? Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back. Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part? Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy! This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations. No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please! You're gonna scare it off. I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it. It's too far away. Is that a palace? It's a windmill. Windmill. Who built it? Some king? Just the men who used to live here. They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high. Winterfell has towers three times that size. \"I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.\" If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell. What's swooning? Fainting. What's fainting? When a girl sees blood and collapses. Why would a girl see blood and collapse? Well not all girls are like you. Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow. My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday. I'd like to see you in a silk dress. Would you? So I could tear it off you. Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye. Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell. Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back. Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that. - You know nothing-- - Six times in the last thousand years, a King-beyond-the-Wall has attacked the kingdoms. - Six times they failed. - And how do you know that? Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same. - Mance is different. - You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together. - You don't know that. - I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you. All of us. You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live. Yes, first we'll live. What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work? Hodor. - That's where we are. - What are you telling him? - It's all right, Osha. - It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse. - Leave him alone. - He can speak for himself. I don't fill his head with anything. So what do you talk about? What's happening to him and what that means. Go on, then. Tell us what it means. It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier. I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black. - We're not going to Castle Black. - What did you say? I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall. Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me. The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now. You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong. What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason? Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone. You don't understand. You don't know. You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long. I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further. How is the pain, my lord? What's the purpose of an arm with no hand? Well, we've stymied the corruption. Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man. All the good it's done me. You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle. Faint praise, my lord. So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many? No, my lord. That's not my weakness. What is? Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted. You performed experiments on living men. - On dying men. - With their permission? My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives. Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside. How many men have you killed, my lord? I don't know. Countless. Countless has a nice ring to it. And how many lives have you saved? Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you-- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth? A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return. - A fair offer. - A fair offer. Locke won't take it. Why not? He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros. He feels he's being cheated. They'd be fools to kill her. These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much. We have to return to Harrenhal. Why? I've left something behind. Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton. And what are those orders? To deliver you to your father at King's Landing. You think you'll get a reward. I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-- You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off. I had nothing-- Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now. Whoa. - Eyes open, lads. - Be quiet.  The bear, the bear and the maiden fair   From there to here, from here to there   All black and brown and covered in hair   He smelled that girl in the summer air   The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!  Don't spare her. Don't spare her! Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight. A wooden sword? - I thought you'd gone. - You gave her a wooden sword. We've only got one bear. I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there. All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold. This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it. Ah! - Get behind me. - I will not. What the fuck are you doing to my bear? Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do. Pull her up. Hold my legs. Pull him up! The bitch stays. We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me. She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders. What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive? Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.", "summary": ["Plot Dany exchanges gifts with a slave lord outside of Yunkai. As Sansa frets about her prospects, Shae chafes at Tyrion's new situation. Tywin counsels the king, and Melisandre reveals a secret to Gendry. Brienne faces a formidable foe in Harrenhal.  Summary In the North Ygritte and Jon Bear and Maiden Fair Jon and Ygritte make their way to Castle Black.  After surviving the perilous climb of the Wall, Jon Snow, Ygritte, and the wildlings led by Tormund Giantsbane make their way towards Castle Black to await Mance Rayder's signal to begin the attack on the Night's Watch. Afterwards Jon confronts Orell about cutting his and Ygritte's rope loose on The Wall, nearly killing the both of them in the process. Orell tells Jon that he doesn't see Ygritte complaining about what happened because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation, also telling Jon that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her. During the journey through the woods, a clearly jealous Orell confronts Ygritte and says that he would be a better man for her than Jon Snow, while continuing to express his distrust in Jon. Jon also tries to persuade Ygritte that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure, reminding her that six Kings-Beyond-the-Wall have attacked the southern lands in the past thousand years and all have been repelled. Ygritte refuses to listen and points out that Jon is technically one of them; if it fails, so does he. She renews her passion for him and tells him bluntly that if they die, they die, but before they die they will live in each other.  At his prison, Theon Greyjoy is released from the cross to which he is chained by two beautiful girls. The women lay Theon down on a bed and then proceed to dramatically seduce him. They say repeatedly that they have heard that the heir to Pyke is well endowed and are hoping to get first hand experience. Theon is distrustful at first, fearing that this is another of his tormenter's tricks. Theon cannot help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion. Suddenly, the familiar horn sounds and the boy enters. Theon is terrified and tries to escape, but is struck hard on the head and is flung to the ground. The boy claims he too has heard about Theon's famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part. When the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife, Theon realizes the boy means to remove his penis. Horrified, Theon begs for mercy, but the boy quips that this is mercy as he's not killing Theon, merely altering him. Two large men hold a screaming Theon down while the boy moves in to emasculate him.  In The North, on their way to the Wall, Bran Stark's party makes camp. Osha remains distrustful of Meera and Jojen Reed and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the Wall. Osha bluntly refuses to go, explaining that she lost her husband, who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her. She rages that none of them understand what lies beyond the Wall and that there is nothing left for men there.  In Yunkai Daenerys Targaryen's army marches on to the next great city of Slaver's Bay, Yunkai. She and Barristan Selmy are confident they can take the city, given that Yunkai are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers. Ser Jorah notes with wisdom however that Yunkai's defenders won't fight them in open battle, being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the Targaryen army through guerrilla tactics. He also advises Daenerys that conquering Yunkai does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake Westeros. Dany however is adamant on freeing the slaves of Yunkai, who number in the hundreds of thousands. She orders Grey Worm to send a messenger to the city and inform Yunkai's slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as Astapor.  Drogon protective S3E7 Daenerys meets with Razdal.  The Yunkish herald is carried into Daenerys's camp on a litter carried by slaves, along a road flanked by Unsullied. Missandei announces the newcomer as Razdal mo Eraz, one of the ruling \"Wise Masters\" of Yunkai. Daenerys meets the man in her pavilion, flanked by her dragons who vie for her attention and fight over the pieces of meat she tosses to them; they also snarl at Razdal when he gets too close. Razdal declares that Yunkai was an ancient civilization long before the rise of Valyria and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it. However Daenerys is not threatened, commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her Unsullied much needed practice. Razdal tries a different tact, asserting there is no need for their factions to fight, that Yunkai is willing to overlook her attack on Astapor and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to Westeros. In exchange, they ask that Daenerys leave Yunkai in peace.  Daenerys makes a counter-offer: she will spare the lives of Razdal and the slave-masters of Yunkai if every slave (men, women and children) in the city is set free, and given as much food, clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services. She warns that if her offer is rejected, Yunkai will be shown no mercy. Razdal takes offense, promising that Yunkai will be more of a challenge for her than Astapor or Qarth, and threatens her with the retribution of Yunkai's \"powerful friends\" who he claims will take great pleasure in destroying her army and enslaving the survivors. At that, Drogon and his siblings roar in anger; Razdal protests that he was promised safe conduct, to which Daenerys counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother. After the dragons prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him, Razdal storms out of the pavilion, muttering curses. Daenerys tells Jorah to find out more about Yunkai's \"powerful friends\" before she commits herself to an attack on the city.  On the Narrow Sea Traveling back from the Riverlands, a ship carrying Melisandre and Gendry leaves King's Landing and passes through Blackwater Bay. Melisandre stares at the broken wrecks of Stannis's fleet destroyed by the wildfire, asserting that her presence might have turned the tide of battle. She questions Gendry and is surprised to learn he is unaware of his father's real identity. As they pass by the Red Keep, Melisandre reveals to Gendry that he is King Robert Baratheon's bastard son.  In the Riverlands Arya - The Bear and the Maiden Fair Arya begins to hate the Brotherhood.  At the camp of the Brotherhood Without Banners, Arya, disillusioned with the Brotherhood for selling Gendry, takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the night. Before she gets too far, however, she is snatched up by Sandor Clegane, who was lying in wait for her.  In the Riverlands, en route to The Twins, Robb Stark's army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. Catelyn warns them that the prickly Lord Walder Frey will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but Edmure Tully points out that Frey is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that Frey wanted one of his daughters wed to a king. Robb retorts that Edmure is the best match House Frey has been offered in its history. Later that night, as Robb and Talisa prepare for bed, she tells him she is pregnant with his child. Robb is gladdened by the news.  In King's Landing At King's Landing, neither Sansa or Tyrion are particularly happy about their impending marriage. Margaery Tyrell consoles Sansa, reminding her that Tyrion is far from the worst Lannister and that Tyrion might be able to make her happy, given his skill as a lover. Bronn, meanwhile, points out to Tyrion that he can easily wed Sansa and get a son and heir from her to placate his father and keep having sex with Shae in private, thereby getting two women and a kingdom to rule for himself. However, Tyrion is concerned his mistress isn't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife, a mistress and the entire North despising him. Bronn points out that Tyrion is wasting his time trying to be universally loved. Tyrion's fears prove accurate as Shae bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds Sansa.  Bear maiden fair joff tywin Tywin confronts Joffrey.  Meanwhile, Tywin Lannister enters the throne room to answer a summons from King Joffrey. After exchanging some false courtesy Tywin asks why his grandson wished to see him. Joffrey wants an update on what the Small Council has been doing. Tywin informs Joffrey that the king can attend any Small Council meeting should he desire it. The boy king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the council meetings has changed. Tywin says that he is holding the meeting in the Tower of the Hand to save time. When Joffrey complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting, Tywin silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne, silently glares down at Joffrey, and then sardonically says he could arrange to have Joffrey carried. A disconcerted Joffrey changes the subject to Daenerys Targaryen; Tywin is surprised that Joffrey even knows about the exiled princess. Tywin admits the reports are apparently true that the last Targaryen is not only alive, but has successfully hatched the first live dragons the world has seen in almost two centuries. Joffrey is puzzled at why Tywin doesn't think they should do anything about her, but Tywin reminds Joffrey that the last Targaryen dragons were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone, and Daenerys' dragons are probably just curiosities at best, not grand weapons of war. Moreover, Tywin says that even if Daenerys' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago, they are on the far side of the world and no threat to Joffrey's rule. Tywin also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor's council on matters he does not comprehend. When Joffrey protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything, Tywin says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform Joffrey should he deem it necessary. Before taking his leave Tywin smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten Joffrey squirming on the Iron Throne. Their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom.  At Harrenhal At Harrenhal, Jaime speaks one last time to Brienne before he leaves. Jaime remarks that he owes Brienne a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his hand. Brienne tells Jaime to repay his debt by keeping his pledge. Jaime promises that he will keep his word to return Catelyn Stark's daughters to her.  The next day, Jaime leaves Harrenhal in the company of Qyburn (who is to accompany Jaime to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his Maester's chain restored through Lord Tywin's influence- Jaime jokes that his father will make Qyburn Grand Maester if he grows Jaime a new hand) and a number of Bolton soldiers under the command of Steelshanks, one of Lord Bolton's captains. Lord Roose Bolton, who is also about to depart Harrenhal for the Twins, under orders from Robb Stark, requests that Jaime pass on his regards to Tywin; Jaime asks that Bolton do the same for him with Robb. Locke, who has been left in charge of the castle in Bolton's absence, can't resist poking fun at the departing Jaime and sneers that he will 'take good care' of Brienne, though Jaime doesn't rise to the bait.  When their party makes camp, as Qyburn checks Jaime's stump, Jaime questions how the former Maester lost his chain. Qyburn explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness. Jaime is disgusted by this revelation, but Qyburn counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions Jaime on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved. Jaime responds that he has probably killed thousands, but he saved half a million lives when he killed the Mad King to save the population of King's Landing, much to Qyburn's surprise.  Jaime then asks about Brienne; Qyburn confirms that they sent a raven to her father, Lord Selwyn Tarth, and he offered a ransom of 300 Gold Dragons for his daughter's safe return. However, Locke refused the offer; still under the misapprehension that Tarth owns every sapphire mine in Westeros, Locke is convinced Lord Selwyn is trying to cheat him. When Qyburn mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing Brienne before they die in battle or winter, Jaime, feeling guilty because his lie to protect Brienne has invertantly placed her in greater danger, urges Steelshanks to return to Harrenhal. Though the man initially refuses, Jaime uses the promise of a reward and the threat of Tywin Lannister's retribution to convince him to go back.  Bear and maiden fair promo brienne a Brienne is thrown in the bear pit.  Upon arriving at Harrenhal, Jaime is shocked and furious to find Locke and his cronies have thrown Brienne into a bear pit, facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself, as they all mockingly sing The Bear and the Maiden Fair. Jaime orders Locke to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants, but Locke dismisses the offer, getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of Brienne being torn apart. In desperation, Jaime leaps into the pit to help her; before the bear can harm either of them, Steelshanks shoots it with a crossbow, distracting the beast long enough for Jaime and Brienne to be pulled out of the pit. Locke tries to stop them from leaving, but Jaime angrily tells him that Lord Bolton cares more about getting him back to King's Landing alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy, and backed up by Steelshanks and his men, Locke is unable to stop them. Jaime then departs Harrenhal with his escort and Brienne in tow."], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Contrary to the other reviews, I enjoyed this one - it had some great dialogue and explored a lot of the key romantic relationships in more depth.First and foremost was Jaime and Brienne. Obviously the whole dynamic there has been one of growing respect, and maybe even love, between these two characters who we've really seen grow through their interactions with each other. I certainly could not have imagined Jaime doing something so heroic as he did in last night's episode last season, yet it seemed natural here. Their shared glances last night were great.I also really enjoyed the fallout from the Sansa/Tyrion pairing, namely in his conversation with Bron and hers with Margaery. Any episode that features Tyrion and Bron chatting it up is worth an extra star alone and this one didn't disappoint. I've also shifted from being a Sansa-disliker (hater is too strong) to being really interested in her growth as a character. This episode was that turning point for me. Obviously she's still all about the princess bling, but her growing friendship (and it seems genuine) with Margaery is becoming really interesting.Then there was Robb and Talisa. Obviously this was a plot-movement point, with the birth of a new potential heir, but the captivating moment for me was seeing Kat's reaction to their interaction. This is no time for love, there's a war going on, you can hear her say with her icy stare. Listen to your mother! On mother's day no less! Obviously her relationship to Robb is evolving as she grapples with him being an adult, prone to rash decisions.And last night's episode also saw harsh reality infiltrate the infatuation of Jon Snow and Ygritte. I still love the way she says his name with that Irish/Scottish accent, Jon Snow, but we saw their sworn loyalty for each other come up against jealousy and practicality with a lot of open questions: Will Jon Snow help attack Castle Black? If he doesn't side with Mance, will Ygritte's loyalty to him disappear, contra her promise? Will she die in their doomed raid, leading to an 0 for 7? Will a concerted effort by Orell be the nail in the coffin of their now-tenous relationship? What was at one point the strongest connection now seems to face long odds.In terms of non-romance-driven dialogue, there was Tywin and Joffrey, which I thought was one of the highlights. You could see Joffrey straining against the constraints that have him limited to being a simple figurehead to Tywin's machinations. And as the audience, we know he's right! Tywin obviously has the upper hand by miles, but I actually think Joffrey might bring things to a climactic head at some point - this was the beginning of that conflict, a conflict that will obviously draw in Cersei, among others, for an inevitably interesting conflict of interest..Tying up loose ends: Theon - awful, as usual. I have hated every scene without fail.Tyrion/Shae - I actually found her a bit cloying here.Dany - This episode set the stage for what I think will be an interesting confrontation - either that or another victory in her gathering snowball of freed slaves and dragons.Gendry, Bran and Arya - Still alive.Game of Thrones is about power, obviously, but also about people as human beings and the inherent conflict between these two poles.See, for example, the Robb plotline, the Jaime plotline, the Tyrion/Shae plotline, etc etc. I mean, Varys being a eunich is far more than coincidence as is Littlefinger rising up by running a whorehouse. Ultimately, some episodes will hit the power/politics dynamic more while others will be more about the interpersonal interactions.If you're focused on the political intrigue alone, there wasn't much for you in this episode. As Marc Bodnick notes, \"talk, talk, talk.\"However, if you're interested in the characters and their relationship to each other, particularly the romantic component, then I thought this was really good episode.\u00a0 Heck, even some of my favorite French movies are just talk, talk, talk... :)", "\u2605\u2605\u2605This episode was not my favorite. It felt bloated without a lot of progress.\u00a0 In fact without the ending scene I would have given it a 2-star rating.There are several scenes with Jon Snow.\u00a0 These felt relatively flat this week and really seemed like rehashes of previous scenes.\u00a0 The one that had some tension and passion was the one where Jon described to Ygritte how they would never win and you could see how me really cared not to lose her in battle.\u00a0 There was another scene between Ygritte and the Seer which had been dealt previously with by longing looks and probably could have been kept that way.Arya's temper finally got the better of her and she ran away and right into the hands of the Hound.\u00a0 I don't know why, but I feel that she is safer with him than with the Brothers Without Banners.\u00a0 Perhaps this is reading too much into his quasi-chivalrious behavior toward Sansa.We see Melisandre trying to convince Robert Baratheon's bastard son that he is of noble lineage and him resisting.\u00a0 We get the feeling that he is going to\u00a0 get behind it like all the Baratheon boys and to his own doom.\u00a0 His better judgement is telling himself not to believe it.\u00a0 He probably should. The scene between Margaery and Sansa was nice.\u00a0 It shows Margaery has the most sense of anyone under 30 years of age.\u00a0 Sansa is continuing to be written as if she is half the age that she is.The scene between Shae and Tyrion also was a dud.\u00a0 I'm tired of her playing pissed off.\u00a0 Either she gets that Tyrion loves her or she doesn't.\u00a0 If she doesn't believe it, she needs to get the f' out of dodge, asap.\u00a0 I mean really.\u00a0 It's like she came down with a pissy case of Sansa-itis. The scene between Joffrey and Tywin is pretty good.\u00a0 Joffrey is being his prissy-pricky self and Tywin is attempting to tell the boy to grow up.\u00a0 I fear for Tywin's safety.\u00a0 Joffrey doesn't give a rat's ass who anyone is if they belittle his diminutive stature.The scene with Bran in the North is a bit dull too. I understand that Osha doesn't like the kids. I know that she's afraid of what's happening.\u00a0 I wish that the tension was expressed in a more dramatic way.\u00a0 Her story about her husband being taken by a White Walker was compelling.\u00a0 I wish that they were using these scenes to tell us more about the power of the Old Gods and perhaps having flashbacks to the distant past or into the future. Daenerys is trying to take another city.\u00a0 She's getting a bit cocky.\u00a0 She should move on and take a good deal when it's presented.\u00a0 Don't let perfection be the enemy of good.\u00a0 She wants to free all the slave cities.\u00a0 But keep an eye on the prize.\u00a0 You get a fleet and some bounty and now can get moving.\u00a0 Taking siege to a fortified city is a big undertaking.\u00a0 You should really make sure you really need it, even with a psychotically loyal eunuch army.Getting back to the same-ol-same-ol:\u00a0 The scene with Robb Stark bored me yet again.\u00a0 I feel like they want me to say \"congratulations!\u00a0 you can copulate!\"\u00a0\u00a0 Another ol-snoozefest is the Theon being tortured scene.\u00a0 I mean we all knew this was coming.\u00a0 Throw in some naked girls to make it more bizarre.\u00a0 I was rooting for him to really get it on for the last time, because it was so telegraphed.\u00a0 But die already, would you, Theon?Okay on to the truly high point of the season, which has been the relationship between Brienne and Jaime and more generally the growth of Jaime's character from one of abject amorality to one of morality and selflessness.\u00a0 Jaime is being gnawed away at by the fate of Brienne.\u00a0\u00a0 After Lord Bolton leaves for the Arranged Marriage Part Deux, he realizes he has a chance to take advantage of the leaderless soldiers.\u00a0 He forces the return of his brigade to the keep to find Brienne defending herself with a pathetic wooden sword from a bear in an arena cage match.\u00a0 Jaime, not caring for his life, since he truly believes his life is forfeit without his fighting hand, drops himself into the match and puts himself between the bear and Brienne and helps her escape.\u00a0\u00a0 He then negotiates the the ensuing standoff and takes Brienne. This show really has shown the dynamic range of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.\u00a0 I think he is deserves some bigger roles in movies.\u00a0 He was in Mama and did a great job in a reasonable film.\u00a0 I hope he continues to get bigger and better roles.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605This was a 3 out of 5 star Game of Thrones episode. Game of Thrones marking is on a different scale than any other show. They have the best actors, writing, directing, the most compelling scenery and sets, excellent costumes, makeup, cinematography. This is not \"2 and a half Broke Girls\" or whatever. It would have been a 2 out 5 if it wasn't for the amazing, thrilling, beautifully acted last scene.This episode was in need of a big sharp pair of editor's scissors. It wandered from place to place, lingering in unnecessary spots and skipping quickly over others.I didn't realize until after that this episode was written by GRRM. It didn't seem to flow. How could it be so unstructured and verbose?\u00a0 Was this a case of hero worship where none of the producers, cast or crew could or would rein him in?I would have loved to have seen a tighter version of this episode. It had so much potential. Here's what I'd do if I had the scissors.Clearer themes, threads that runs through the episode bringing disparate storylines together. Young rulers ignoring good council. Young people ignoring bad council. Mistrust and mismatches.Scene 1: Stark's base campStart with outside overview of the rainy camp. A few more lingering moments of people running through the muck. Really emphasize that people are f****** miserable. Good, realistic picture of the war dragging on. The exhaustion and ongoing grind. So much could be expressed by that scene of the rain and the mud. Then come into Robb having his hair dried by Talisa. The contrast of the outside and inside. The sacrifice and the short-sighted decisions. Keep the scene with Catelyn trying to convince them to keep going, to not be a day late and slight Frey even more. Catelyn's council is now completely dismissed. Drop the exchange about Frey being like wet shit and Talisa being OK with it, because she\u2019s nursed people. Somehow convey that Robb seems very unsure what to do with the warplans. Save the pregnancy \"What now?\" for next episode or put it in a previous episode. Sub out a quarter of those scenes of Theon torture.\u00a0 End this scene with the look that Catelyn gives when she turned back to see Robb and Talisa making out. Cut. Perfect. Excellent acting. End exactly there. Scene 2: somewhere in Essos, Dany et alGo to Dany in Yonkai. Contrast. Here, I have no idea where this is going. Daenerys. Not sure what to make of this. Does she feel for the slaves and/or realizes that freed slaves will make her best soldiers? Is it an excuse to be cruel? (I can\u2019t explain this more but it\u2019s like a righteous anger that seems a bit off target. She's playing a game to get to Westeros. Will this take her off-course? I loved the soldiers lining the road and the drum beaters going back to the wildings conversation.\u00a0 The actor was too insipid and instantly unlikable for this role. I would preferred more grey, as is usual in GoT.\u00a0 I also disliked this bit of dialogue \u201cthe Yonkai are proud people, they do not bend\u201d Danenerys: \u201cWhat happens to things that don\u2019t bend?\u201d Smirk. UGH. That rang so false. And logistically, how is Jorah who doesn\u2019t speak Valerian and doesn\u2019t look at all Yonkai supposed to \u201cfind out\u201d who the powerful connections are? Approach the gate with a bag of gold? They already seem to have a lot of gold.Scene 3: Near the Wall,\u00a0 the wildingsCombine all the dialogue from the previous scene walking. Make the scene about 3/2 length (instead of length of 2 scenes together). Keep the scene with Orella declaring his love \u2013 that was pitch perfect. An angry, clumsy declaration of love. Scene 4: Kings Landing, Sansa and MargaeryI enjoyed the dialogue with Sansa and Margaery. Sansa looks ashen. It's clear she's lived a very sheltered existence. She's been raised by a very moral family and, at a core level, she still believes that others play by the same rules. I believe she\u2019s sadly knowledgeable and worldly about some hard aspects of life. I believe she is that na\u00efve.\u00a0 Did having brothers teach her nothing? Maybe she was sheltered.Scene 5: Kings Landing with Tyrion and BronYes, this was good. Brings up the issue. Creepy the justification though of marrying Sansa who is so much younger and seems so much younger and vulnerable in an uninviting way.\u00a0 Bring into the conversation Tyrion's predicament. It\u2019s an unwinnable situation. Why does he stay? Why does he feel like a Lannister when his own father and sister rejects him? The threads seem to be thinner and thinner.Scene 6: Kings Landing with Joffrey and Tywin It was not a natural, sharpest dialogue. Keep bones of this conversation and tighten it up. Loved having Tywin climb the stairs and stand over Joffrey. Power play master.<Snip >Drop the Shae and Tyrion scene. I'm not sure if it's just the actor playing Shae isn't a good actor. I've been thrown by her acting whenever she's on screen - something is off in her acting, she seems stilted. Either way, what does she want out of this situation? Does she really want him to escape with her? If she was noble born, how did she end up in Westeros. I can't tell.Scene 8: The waters of King\u2019s Landing, Melisandre and GendryPerfect scene. And this will be on the heels of Joffrey and Tywin\u2019s conversation to contrast the castle from the inside, the castle from the outside. The overhead view of destruction of the ships from the wildfire was magnificent. The cinematography of the scene was exquisite. The dialogue was excellent: Melisandre speaking to Gendry, connecting to him with her humble past. Giving the news to Gendry of his true parentage, explaining why the gold cloaks were after him.When she said \u201cthere is power in a King\u2019s blood\u201d, somehow, I don't picture her backing a bid for the Throne, more likely hung upside down to drain blood out of him. Very creepy, good delivery.Scene 9: Cave of the Brotherhood without Banners, Arya's escape. THIS, this is where I wanted more dialogue, more built up. Arya was reduced to a petulant teenager. The words were beneath her character. Escaping was very much in her character though. I felt like the Hound waiting for her grabbing her could have been laid up in a more frightening way. I don\u2019t know how though. It makes sense that the Hound has been following them since the fight took place. Hoping that he'd have a chance to grab Arya, take her back to King's Landing and redeem himself for running away. Although with Joffrey, who knows if he\u2019d been given mercy?Scene 10: Bolton castle with Jaime and BrienneWhat acting. The timbre of the voice, the eyes telling all. Maybe a line or two less at the beginning.\u00a0 Keep the last two lines: \u201cI will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.\u201d \u201cGood bye, Sir Jaime\u201d. Also, was it me or was Jaime oddly lit, almost like he had eye makeup on?<snip>Cut out most of that Bolton castle departure scene.\u00a0 Just keep that Bolton is riding out to the wedding, presumably arriving before the Stark crew.<snip>Cut ALL of the Theon scene. Oh, that felt sooo good.Scene 11:\u00a0 Near the Wall, Ygritte and JonYes, keep the feeling of the scene when Jon was telling Ygritte why the wildings won't win. The dialogue could be shortened. It\u2019s clear that Jon and Ygritte isn't a well-matched love affair. It\u2019s also clear that he\u2019s in love with her. Scene 12:\u00a0 South of the Wall, Osha, Bran, et alI don\u2019t know why this didn\u2019t work. Maybe it needed to be staged differently. With the actors closer together, maybe in the forest \u2013 I could have been such a good scene and yet it fell flat.\u00a0 I loved Osha's backstory on her husband and the white walkers.The stunned looks on the listener\u2019s faces.Scene 13:\u00a0 South of the Bolton\u2019s castle, JaimeInteresting backstory on Qyburn. Another grey character? Revolting methods to good means? And Jaime's comment on saving half-a-million people in King's Landing. Owning his decision. And the line \"I've left something behind.\" was succulently good.Final Scene 14: Bolton\u2019s castle, Jaime and BrienneEnd on that gorgeous crescendo of Brienne and Jaime walking away from the bear pit. That's pure GoT style. The bear and the maiden fair, indeed. The noblest act of Season 3: Jaime going back for his friend, Brienne.\u00a0\u00a0 As a person, he made a decision to turn his men back to get his friend. I won't say \"rescue\" - I'm not sure why. It's not a damsel in distress situation. He jumped into that bear ring to help her because she was his friend. He saw she was about to get killed and leapt in. He didn't have a plan. He didn't have a sword. He didn't have a sword hand. He just jumped right in. A huge, life-threatening risk to take. I loved that she immediately reached back to pull him up. . If this does become a romance, it\u2019s beginning with the truest form \u2013 a friendship, a comrade, admirable. Swoon.And it looks like I could have used some editing as well - this is a LONG review.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605A more or less linear recap of Episode 7:This episode starts with Jon Snow and Ygritte on the other side of the wall. Apparently the way down is much easier than the way up, because they're already leagues away and happily hoofing it to wherever they're headed. Some folks think the dialogue here is boring, but it serves a purpose: Show how unprepared the wildlings are for the south (if Ygritte thinks a windmill is a castle, what's she going to do when she storms Castle Black?); Plant a seed in Ygritte's head that Jon Snow didn't drink the wildling cool-aid; And show us how Ygritte totally rocks the long bow.Rob Stark is getting closer to his confrontation with the Freys. It's time for the king in the north to learn how to kneel and ask forgiveness. The longer they delay, the angrier Lord Frey will become. In the meantime, though, Rob's going to log a few hours in the sack with his wife. This was very weak television, in my opinion. There is literally a solid minute of no-dialogue, no-exposition, no-anything to make Rob and Talisa's necking remotely interesting. I already have to waste 2 minutes of every episode on HBO's weighty opening credits. Why do I have to waste another on Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter's backside?BUT - the revelation that Talisa is pregnant is a huge departure from the books. Seems a bit cliche, but I'm curious to see where the show takes this. My only thought is that they're thinking pro-actively, as in, HBO might catch up to and pass George R. R. Martin's publication schedule. They're going to need something to work with when that happens.Sansa is a bit frustrating because just as soon as she appears to be growing up, she plummets back down into petulant child territory. In the books, she's 13. In the show, she's a bit older. It can be difficult to remember because she is so tall. I'm just glad she has Margaery to help her put things in perspective. As for the wedding night advice, it provided a foil for Sansa's naivete and Margaery's (possibly) more-knowledgeable-than-you-know true nature. There are some rumors in the books that haven't been discussed in the show - yet - but if they are, this scene is laying some of the groundwork. While Margaery is giving Sansa sage advice, Bron is giving Tyrion a bit of medicine, too. Tyrion shouldn't be so reticent to marry Sansa, honestly. He is more than aware of how marriage within the upper classes work. But he's torn between wanting to devote himself to Shae, and wanting to act the part of the Lord. Hopefully he buckles down and gets with the program. It's a disservice to his character to make him a worry wart.Tywin and Joffrey: in previous episodes Tywin berated Cersei for not controlling her son. This scene was interesting because I wanted to see how he planned on doing better. The results were underwhelming. Joffrey is petulant, lazy, bossy, and unpleasant. Tyrion refuses to rise to the bait, but he doesn't cowtow to him either. It wasn't lost on me that the difference between the meanings of \"council\" and \"consult\" are completely lost on Joffrey. As a side note, my friends were like \"Oh no! They know Khaleesi is coming for them!\" But the next scene dispelled that notion.Danaerys' scene was by far one of the strongest of the episode. We get to see her Unsullied, the Yunkish slaver, and the dragons! Dany looks more like a queen than at any other time throughout the series. And yet, she is still a young girl who wants to find surrogate children to mother in place of the children she will never have. Why else refuse ships, money, and a \"hail weather!\" back to Westeros in favor of attacking a well-fortified city to free its slaves? (I mean, apart from \"because that's how it happened in the books\")Shae is getting on my nerves. You would think that an elevated camp follower (a prostitute who makes her living by servicing soldiers) would be able to read the writing on the wall. What does she expect to happen, exactly? Tyrion is going to forswear his inheritance? They're going to run away and get married? She hasn't been paying attention. And poor Tyrion, all he knows how to do is throw his money at a problem until it stops. Jewelry isn't going to fix this.Melisandre and Gendry are sailing past Kings Landing (and magically not ruining their boat on the hulls of the burned and broken ships littering the bottom of the harbor, my sailing friend was quick to point out), and Melisandre drops the bombshell on Gendry about his father. A smart guy would get the heck away from that creepy woman, but somehow I think that's not in the cards for Gendry.Arya has less of a role to play in this episode. Lately she's been sounding like a broken record (you're not a brotherhood, you're just a lying band of thieves!). Luckily for us, she's parted ways with the brotherhood, and it looks like we're going to get our second unlikely pairing of the season: Arya and the Hound. (If you thought Jaime and Brienne was a bad combo, you thought wrong! This is round two.) But we're going to have to wait another episode to see it.Theon Greyjoy just needs to die already. Or at least make it look like he dies, so I don't have to hear about him anymore. His torture is weird, and very uncomfortable to sit through. I know why they're showing the torture, but just like I've mentioned before, if you haven't read the books then the \"big reveal\" isn't a good enough payoff to make viewers sit through this icky mess. Bran, Osha, Jojen and Meera are still traveling, still dysfunctional. It's a lot of talking, but it's also important to see that they're making progress towards the wall.Jaime has become the man-crush of the hour among my Game of Thrones\u00a0 watching buddies. \"He's so bad ass!\"\u00a0 \"He's going to go back for\u00a0 Brienne!\"\u00a0 \"Woah, that stump is gnarly.\"\u00a0 \"Is he going to save her? Tell\u00a0 me he's going to save her!\"\u00a0 It's really hard keeping mum around my\u00a0 friends. =)\u00a0 I love the progression of Jaime's character. Can't wait to\u00a0 see where they take him.", "\u2605Talk talk talk. Practically nothing happened in this episode, which is frustrating since this has basically been the story all season long. Now that we're seven episodes in, the goodwill I have toward the show is no longer enough to sustain me through another hour of nothing happening, given the latent promise of big things happening downstream. I know it can be unfair to review single episodes that really sit in the context of a holistic seasonal arc. But to simplify my perspective on this week -> I felt like you could have cut this entire episode and it almost wouldn't have mattered.Pacing issues all over the place this week.Shae, Tyrion, Sansa. Everybody talks about how unhappy they are.Bran. People talking. Theon - more torture. No movement of story, no clarification of what's going on. Joffrey and Tywin. \"I'm annoyed that I can't go to the small council meeting.\" Yawn.Robb Stark and his wife -- rain delay. More sitting around in that same planning tent that we've been in since episode 1. Jeez are they out of budget to show Rob actually doing stuff? \"We can't move our troops and get going to the wedding because it's raining.\"\u00a0 Daenerys. These scenes were OK, but again it feels like filler to stretch out time between action.Even the Jaime and Brienne scene is repetitive. Just when Jaime is on his way, moving toward something new in his storyline, he decides to turn around and go back to save Brienne. Yes, yes, we get it -- (1) he's a changed man and (2) he feels some kind of loyalty or kindness to her. But I wish the show could establish this with more speed and drama.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605This is more of a rant of the show's direction in general than an actual review of the episode.I made a prediction in my review of the first episode that this season would somewhat be a disappointment. It does not sound unlikely now. Breaking up the third book into two seasons, given the immense success of the past two seasons, made the team overconfident, thinking that there would be more space for creative delaying tactics to be had. They succeeded but somewhat succumbed to the lack of inspiration and overall direction of content to keep gripping us still.It's weird because three episodes remain and we still have, as far as I know, three missing characters -- surely even more based on the next episode's promo -- that were cast at the beginning of shooting who has yet to make an on-screen appearance. The ones I know are as follows; a slightly relevant girl of the wildlings, a new interest for Daenerys, and an enigmatic character with hands as cold as snow.If there was a single thing I could do to quell both sides of the fandom (the book readers and the not) were I part of the show creators -- and who knows why I'm saying this now -- would be to submit risk and deviate far from the source material, and to shush the united cacophony of annoying book readers. Surprisingly enough, the moments that excite me the most are those that are unfamiliar to me as a book reader. Moments like Melisandre and Gendry being together, the Olenna Tyrell and Tywin Lannister jape sparring, that one Varys-centric episode, and that one where Varys and Petyr Baelish came to a draw of ideals, and this episode's revelation of Orell's affection for Ygritte. Those stood out as perfect moments where I can truly feel that the next revelation would be stunner.The complaints echoed by many are reasonable. I, even after reading the books, do not understand myself Theon's predicament, even though I am fully aware of the sadist's identity. Still the actions that led to his downfall do not completely justify the current situation he is in. The complaint of having a neverending banter is typical of George R. R. Martin as well. It has been discussed somewhere that he dislikes writing action sequences compared to his preference of highlighting the dramatic-romantic aspect of his prose as evident in this episode as it is written by he himself. This has got to be the most romantic episode of the series, like, ever. That is indeed ironic, because the events that are about to happen in the next couple of episodes which they are building upon is bigger and better than anything he has ever come up with. These constant building up of characters are so pulling us away from the climax that, in the end, there is nothing for us to root for. This season, due to the body of this episode, has made me for the first time think that maybe, just maybe, plot is much more important than character.But, in their defence, the series is not really known for a more linear once-upon-a-time tale.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605Originally posted this review as a comment.+\u00a0 I think the Joffrey/Tywin meeting was really interesting. Joffrey's\u00a0 spoiled reaction to where the council meetings are held and Tywin's\u00a0 condescendingly patient explaining of the order of things shows the\u00a0 maturity gap between the two generations of rulers and the irony that an\u00a0 experienced, over-qualified leader of men is advising a child who sits\u00a0 on the throne.+ For the first time in the entire show, we are\u00a0 seeing a real human side to Jamie. From when we first saw him he\u00a0 paralyzed the Stark boy and tried to kill him, to where we see him now\u00a0 risking his own life to protect Brienne. However at times you see him\u00a0 fail to learn the lesson in humility he suffered with losing his hand,\u00a0 as I noticed he kept on mentioning his father and royalty as a method of\u00a0 persuasion. + The Tyrion/Shae conversation was pretty strung\u00a0 out and you could tell where it was going, but the conversation between\u00a0 Sansa and Margery's conversation outside about Tyrion and sexuality\u00a0 shows the maturation of Sansa's character, as well as a more ambigious\u00a0 side of\u00a0 Margery as she unconvincingly batted away Sansa's inquiry of\u00a0 the source of her knowledge on the subject.+ Gendry finding\u00a0 out he is the bastard son of Robert Barathien is intriguing, considering\u00a0 we don't know what\u00a0 Melisandre has planned for him but has implications\u00a0 of big things.+ I think the relationship between Snow, Ygritte,\u00a0 and the apparent jealousy of that guy who can have visions with animals\u00a0 (or whatever) is pretty boring. Didn't care for any of it, and it was\u00a0 predictable from the last episode that he is going to play a big part in\u00a0 whatever happens to the two.+ The rainy night in the opening\u00a0 scene and the troops marshaling outside contrasting with Robb Stark\u00a0 & Jeyne talking about their family shows the disconnect between the\u00a0 war effort and the distraction of growing a family. This tells me that\u00a0 they live in their own little world while chaos exists in their own\u00a0 backyard.+ The plot line involving Danarys and the new city she\u00a0 wants to sack (the name escapes me) was important to me. For the first\u00a0 time I'm noticing that she is overstepping her bounds, and starts to\u00a0 show her lust for power. Her dialogue upon learning how many slaves live\u00a0 there and her decision to use them as surplus to her army interestingly\u00a0 contradicts the exterior she is keeping as a liberator of slaves. The\u00a0 growth of her dragons were also very fun to see.+ I didn't care for the Arya storyline. + The only plot line that frustrates me is the Theon torture - it's just the same thing for the past four or five episodes. +\u00a0 Speaking of torture, the Bran scene was woeful to watch. When she was\u00a0 talking about her \"turned\" boyfriend choking her and started crying, I\u00a0 wanted to choke myself to make the time go by faster.It was average overall in\u00a0 terms of what actually happened. We saw some pretty interesting developments in Jamie Lannister, Sansa Stark, and Danarys.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the rest of the episode is pretty forgettable and the banality of the other scenes\u00a0 detracted from the flow of the overall episode. I wish I could rate this episode 2.5 stars, but will round up my rating to three stars because I still had fun watching it.", "\u2605\u2605It was a poor episode, especially so as it was written by GRRM himself. I was very disappointed with the two main scenes that looked promising: Dany in Yunkai: What's gotten into her? She seems particularly obnoxious in this episode, and her lines (the whole scene, really) seems extraordinarily made-up and dumb. And dumb. Did I say dumb? Yes, dumb. \"Get out\", \"Find out\". Emilia Clarke delivers such lines very weakly. And the actor playing mo Eraz (the Yunkish envoy) just sucks. Big downvote.Tywin and Joffrey: Argh. It was almost there, but I could feel it again, the artificialness and sheer uselessness of that scene. Poor writing - I felt that both characters, while acting well in their characteristic style, were undone by the horrible words they had to utter. It looked very forced and unnecessary. Left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. The rest of the scenes were either boring or redundant, or both. I don't mind the lack of action, but at least make the conversational face-offs worth watching! (They're the strength of the show, IMO.)Peter Dinklage did his poorly-written bit well. Tip of my hat to him. I also liked the scene where Gendry finds out who daddy was. These two earn the episode a star each.", "\u2605\u2605Jay Wacker hit on all of the major plot points, so I won't rehash those. Outside of the Brienne/Jaime plotline, I was pretty disappointed with this episode. In general, it felt aimless and lacking in any major plot development. The most peculiar aspect of that, however, is that George R.R. Martin himself wrote this episode (it's the only episode he wrote for this season)! If this is an accurate snapshot of Martin's current state of writing (aimless and lacking plot development), then I'm extremely worried for how long we're going to have to wait for The Winds of Winter (unreleased book) (book six in the series)."]}, "27": {"id": "s03e08", "name": "Second Sons", "script": "Is the Wall as big as they say? Bigger. - How much longer? - A few more days. I found something at the Fist of the First Men. What does it do? I'm not sure that it does anything. You're not supposed to be here. - If your father knew-- - He said you're a traitor. I am, child. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. My lady, I can't read the words. I wouldn't know where to start. At the beginning. This word is Aegon. The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. - We can defeat them. - But they won't meet us on the field. They have strong walls. Women in our position must make the best of our circumstances. How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him. I didn't ask for this marriage. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her. My feelings for you have not changed. Listen to me, my lady. I'm not your lady. I'm your whore. You will release every slave in Yunkai. You are mad. We have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well. He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about? - I don't know. - Find out. Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? - Your blood is noble. - I'm just a bastard. The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon. There is power in a king's blood. You're a liar! You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. Now-- - Anguy, bring her back. - Come back, girl! Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good. I'll give you one try, girl. Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard. Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you. There's no one worse than you. Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them. You're lying. Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open. Is that the Blackwater? The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you? Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen. Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins. But why? Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you. Why would they be at the Twins? Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding. Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted. They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well. You know these men? Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, \"The Titan's Bastard.\" Is he more titan or bastard? He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are. How many? 2,000, Your Grace. Armored and mounted. Enough to make a difference? It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I imagine you're right. I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning. He may not agree to meet. He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl. Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons-- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and Daario Naharis. You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys. - Mind your tongue. - Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it. You, slave girl, bring wine. We have no slaves here. You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? Under 2,000, Your Grace. We have more, don't we? 10,000 Unsullied. I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have 8,000 Unsullied. You're very young to be a captain. He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant. Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run. Or you could fight for me. We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai. I would pay you as much and more. Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again. Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder. Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink? - A barrel, then. - Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you. I'll come looking for you when this is over. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. Gladly, Your Grace. Half Robert, half lowborn. Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon. What do you mean to do with him? You know what I mean to do with him. Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy. Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king? No. If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor. You've slaughtered many lambs? And none have seen the blade. \"And tho-- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod-- rode Vhagar-- Vhag--\" Fuck me. \"Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog-- enough-- enough to swallow a horse whole.\" Your Grace. They feeding you enough? Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain. You don't belong in a place like this. Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse. Yeah. I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad. Melisandre's returned. I didn't know she'd been gone. Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy. Why? She says there's power in king's blood. She's going to kill him. Sacrifice him. Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew. What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night? Because he has your blood in his veins. So did Renly. Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. - He's an innocent. - How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom? Your Grace, why did you come to see me today? I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again. I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her. You have little regard for your own life. Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, \"I don't ever want to die.\" I wanted to say to him, \"You won't, child. You won't ever.\" I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night. I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real? Little dragon bitch. She talks too much. You talk too much. She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock. between her and your cock. My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach? She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me. Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores. I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend. She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. - What's the difference? - I fight for beauty. For beauty? We fight for gold. The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die-- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you. You'll die young. What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield. There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her. - She's well guarded. - Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights. Which one of us? Close your eyes, love. Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking. Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here. You have something for me? Valar morghulis. Lady Sansa. You look very handsome, my lord. Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden? My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this. I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord. No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say-- I'm just trying to say very badly-- I just-- just want to say I know how you feel. I doubt that very much, my lord. You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel. But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine? When I have to. Well, today you have to. You look radiant, Your Grace. Radiant? Why radiant? It's the word that came to mind. We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends. You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice. A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid. Ah, but you know the song \"The Rains of Castamere\"? Of course. They play it so often here at court. So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? Not as well as you, I'm sure. House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone. Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. \"And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.\" If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep. What are you doing? Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband. You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection. Could you Thank you. Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever. Have you ever seen one like it? I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life. It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it. In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken. Here, taste this. You think I'm trying to poison you? That's good. That's really good. Where do you think it's from? I couldn't even guess. Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take. That thought had crossed my mind, yeah. There are no mistakes. Not for us. I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern. Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us. I don't understand. This-- this doesn't seem very religious. According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see. Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I. Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me. What are you doing? You have to trust me. What--? Get it away. Get it off me. Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much. Why are you doing this? I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood. No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there! You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration. Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord! The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute. Will you pardon me, my lord? Of course. Of course. En-- enjoy. Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead. I've got a lifetime for that. Stay. You seem rather drunk. Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding? This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible. - And? - If you're going to give her one, you need to perform. What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast. - More than once. - There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit. You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty. Well My father once told me-- Nobody cares what your father once told you. Congratulations, my lady. Thank you, Your Grace. Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day. Yes, Your Grace. I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that? You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down. Time for the bedding ceremony. There will be no bedding ceremony. Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy. There will be no bedding ceremony. There will be if I command it. Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock. What did you say? What did you say?! I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king. A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there. Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace. I am. Guilty. But-- but it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood. Is that wise, my lord? Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion. Is that wise, Tyrion? Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long. What? Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly? Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage. Stop. I can't. I could, I won't. But your father-- If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to. What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins. Yes, Your Grace. How can anyone speak 19 languages? It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well. Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope-- what do you mean reasonably well? Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh. Athjahakar. Athjahaka. Ath-ja-hakar. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice. Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry. No screaming or she dies. What do you want? You. Let her go. Don't scream, lovely girl. You were sent here to kill me? So why haven't you? I don't want to. What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them. Why? We had philosophical differences. - Over what? - Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them. You're a strange man. I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do. And this is supposed to impress me? Yes. Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine. Will you fight for me? Swear to me. The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours. You really ought to knock. I brought your breakfast. It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night. How hard can it be to build a fire? It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm. He winked at me before. - I doubt it. - I saw him wink at me. He blinked. I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink. A what? Well, I mean, there's no real difference. A wink is on purpose. You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name. Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me? What? No. This is just the way I talk. I'll build that fire. Don't you think he should have a name? I don't know many boys' names. Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jon Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer. Craster. Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-- Mormont. That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name. Why is it a last name? Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly. His name is Samwell Tarly, too? No, Randyll Tarly. Randyll is a handsome name. Please don't name him Randyll. Is your father cruel like mine? Different manner of cruel. Not Randyll, then. Don't. Don't go out there. I'll be back. I just want to look. Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-- It's come for the baby. Stay back! You stay back! No, you can't have him! No! No!", "summary": ["Plot King's Landing hosts a wedding, and Tyrion and Sansa spend the night together. Dany meets the Titan's Bastard. Davos demands proof from Melisandre. Sam and Gilly meet an older gentleman.  Summary In Yunkai Daenerys, Jorah and Barristan hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the Second Sons, a professional mercenary company, the \"powerful friends\" the Yunkish have employed. Barristan explains that although there are only 2,000 of them, the Second Sons are armored and mounted, enough to cause trouble for the Unsullied. Daenerys tells Barristan to organize a meeting with the Second Sons' captains, saying that men who fight for gold \"can't afford to lose to a girl.\"  Shortly thereafter, Daenerys hosts the captains Mero, a Braavosi also known as the Titan's Bastard, and Prendahl na Ghezn, a Ghiscari. Also in attendance is Prendahl's capable and striking lieutenant, Daario Naharis. The uncouth and sexually vulgar Mero makes himself at home, states that Daenerys reminds him of a whore he knows in Lys and feels up Missandei, although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off. Prendahl and Mero refuse Daenerys's offer of an alliance with her larger army, pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the Iron Throne, which is still a distant prospect. With aplomb she replies that a fortnight previous she had no army, and a year before that she had no dragons. Smiling gently she gives them two days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine Mero had demanded. Daario smiles over his back at her as they depart. Once the sellswords are gone, Daenerys drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at Mero's back, instructs Barristan that if they must fight the Second Sons, he is to kill Mero first. Selmy replies that he would be glad to do so.  At the mercenary camp, Mero fondles a Yunkish pleasure-slave while discussing the situation with Prendahl and Daario. Prendahl admits that the Second Sons cannot defeat Daenerys' Unsullied, so Mero suggests that they assassinate her. Mero gives the slave three coins, one each from Volantis, Meereen, and Braavos, and tells her to randomly give them to the three mercenaries; the one who gets the Braavosi coin will kill the queen.  Daario threatens Missandei Daario (dressed as an Unsullied) holds a knife at Missandei's throat.  That night, as Daenerys bathes, she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than 19 languages. Missandei says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of Dothraki. The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable Dothraki and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an Unsullied enters and hold a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He explains that he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a \"philosophical disagreement\" over her beauty. He then produces their severed heads. Intrigued, Daenerys rises from her bath and asks if Daario will swear fealty to her. He bends the knee and swears his sword, his men and his heart to Daenerys.  Beyond the Wall Sam kills the white walker Sam slays a White Walker.  Samwell Tarly and Gilly continue on their journey to Castle Black, taking refuge in a destroyed cabin next to a heart tree. Before they enter, two crows land on a branch on the heart tree, and begin to squawk loudly. Later at night, Sam tries to light a fire, but is frustrated in his attempts; Gilly tries and does it easily. Meanwhile, Sam suggests that Gilly name her son, but she does not know any boy names. Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. Gilly likes the name Randyll, Sam's father's first name, but Sam asks her not to give the child that name. Sam shares the truth about his father and his upbringing marked by cruelty which they both have in common.  Suddenly, they are interrupted by a thunderous squawking of the crows. Sam and Gilly go outside to investigate, and discover hundreds of crows filling the nearby tree and on the structure itself screeching violently. Gilly is then horrified to see a White Walker approaching them, and knows that it is after her child. As the Walker emerges from the trees, it is shown to be the same one that spared Sam before the battle at the Fist. Sam draws his sword and orders it to halt its advance, but the Walker simply grabs his sword blade with a resounding clang. There is a crunching of ice and then the sword itself shatters in his grip. The Walker swats the much larger and heavier Sam aside with one backhander, then continues to bear down upon Gilly who refuses to give up her baby. As the monster reaches out to seize the infant, Sam staggers back to his feet, pulls out his dragonglass dagger, and runs at the Walker in desperation. With a mighty howl that mixes with Gilly's screams, Sam plunges the black glass blade into the Walker's left scapula.................. and the Walker lets out an unholy guttural screech of agony. Whirling to face Sam, its face blanches as it recognises him and screeches again, this time in disbelief. It falls to its knees, and shatters, leaving nothing but white dust and the dagger. The dagger is left behind as Sam and Gilly race away in a panic. The crows fly out of the trees and chase them, screaming their hatred.  In the Riverlands Arya Stark, now a captive of Sandor Clegane after he kidnapped her from the Brotherhood Without Banners, picks up a rock and stands over him planning to strike. She thinks he is sound asleep. He opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him, and kill him, but if she fails he will break her hands. Later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her. Sandor points out that for all she hates him, Arya could have been taken captive by someone far worse. He tells her about Sansa and how he rescued her from a group of would-be rapists. Arya disbelieves this, but Sandor says \"Ask your sister if you ever see her again.\" They arrive at a river which Arya initially thinks to be the Blackwater. Rather confused with her lack of understanding he points out that the river is the Red Fork of the Trident. Arya believed he was taking her back to King's Landing, but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to The Twins, where her mother and brother will shortly be attending her uncle's wedding, and he will ransom her to them. He tells her ruefully that if she wasn't so busy trying to kill him they might make it in time for the wedding. Arya has a small and hidden smile as the Hound spurs the horse to a gallop.  On Dragonstone Melisandre seducing gendry Melisandre seduces Gendry.  Melisandre finally arrives back at Dragonstone with Gendry in tow. Stannis is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew and is bemused when Melisandre orders him fed, bathed and clothed. He believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him, but Melisandre reveals it is merely a sham to keep Gendry feeling secure, in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife.  Meanwhile, Davos Seaworth, still languishing in his cell, is paid a visit by Stannis; Davos is told of the impending sacrifice of Gendry. Davos protests this saying that unlike Renly who was a rebel against his rightful king, Gendry is an innocent who has never done him any wrong. Stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory, which Stannis believes is the only way to save every man, woman and child in Westeros from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path. He asks how Davos can doubt the power of Melisandre's God when Stannis has seen visions of \"a great battle in the snow\" and Davos saw the creature she gave birth to. Davos speculates that the real reason Stannis came is because deep down, a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew Davos would tell him the truth he needs to hear, regardless of how it would be taken. After extracting a promise from Davos that he won't act against Melisandre again, Stannis has him released.  Stannis and leeches Stannis naming the 3 usurpers.  In Gendry's quarters, Melisandre seduces Gendry long enough to distract him, then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body. She explains as Stannis and Davos enter the room that Davos wanted a demonstration of the power in king's blood, then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier. As part of the magical ritual that follows, Stannis throws the leeches into the flames at Melisandre's direction, and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn: \"The usurper Robb Stark, the usurper Balon Greyjoy, the usurper Joffrey Baratheon.\"  In King's Landing At King's Landing, Tyrion speaks with Sansa before their wedding at the Great Sept of Baelor; though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him. Tyrion promises Sansa that he will not mistreat her, and Sansa agrees there are worse Lannisters she could be wed to. Prior to the wedding, Margaery Tyrell tries to ingratiate herself to Cersei, commenting they will technically be sisters soon; Cersei responds by telling Margaery the story behind the \"Rains of Castamere,\" relating how it refers to the destruction of House Reyne of Castamere after their failed rebellion against House Lannister (implying similarities between the ambitions and position of Houses Reyne and Tyrell and that the same fate may fall upon House Tyrell if they plot against the Lannisters) and concludes by threatening to have Margaery strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call Cersei sister again. The ceremony is a grim affair; Joffrey smugly escorts Sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which Tyrion was to stand on to cloak Sansa in Lannister colors as part of the ceremony, eliciting snickers from the congregation (though the scowl of Lord Tywin quickly silences them). Tyrion in the face of humiliation asks Sansa to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders. The new High Septon begins the ceremony. Later as man and wife they have their reception dinner, which also proves a grim and miserable affair.  Tyrion threatens Tyrions threatens Joffrey.  Tyrion spends the wedding feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making light of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife. Tyrion, drunkenly proclaiming himself \"the god of tits and wine,\" reminds his father that Tywin has long called him \"a drunken little lust-filled beast,\" so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem. At the same time, Joffrey is himself drinking too much wine, and losing what few inhibitions he has, his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both Sansa and Tyrion. Against Cersei's ineffectual protests, Joffrey gets up and, flanked by his Kingsguard, taunts Sansa that she's still found a way to marry a Lannister. Joffrey then reflects that it doesn't matter which Lannister gets her pregnant, and openly says he might want to rape her after Tyrion is done with her, while the Kingsguard hold her down.  Joffrey then declares it time for the bedding ceremony (which involves the men at the wedding stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed) but Tyrion angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony. When Joffrey keeps pushing the matter, a furious Tyrion slams his dagger into the table and threatens that Joffrey will \"be fucking [his] own bride with a wooden cock\" if he doesn't let it drop. As the court stands in shocked silence, Joffrey seethes with outrage and Tyrion defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred. After a tense moment, Tywin defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony, and placates Joffrey by claiming Tyrion's outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk. Taking the hint and using it as an excuse to avoid punishment, Tyrion visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is, intentionally humiliating himself, and says he only made a bad joke. It isn't clear if anyone in the room, including Tywin or Joffrey, think that Tyrion's outburst was simply due to inebriation, but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass. Tyrion, while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand, escorts Sansa to their bedchamber.  Once they are alone in their quarters, a tense moment passes as Sansa nervously and slowly undresses. Tyrion ultimately tells her to stop, deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to, and only will if she changes her mind. When Sansa questions what he will do if she never does, Tyrion sarcastically jokes \"And so my watch begins\" - implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the Night's Watch - and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch. The following morning, Shae notices with a hint of a smile that Sansa's bed sheets are not stained with blood and Tyrion's virgin bride is still a virgin."], "review": null}, "28": {"id": "s03e09", "name": "The Rains of Castamere", "script": "You think I can't hear you every day talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and black magic? I don't want you talking to him till we get to Castle Black. We're not going to Castle Black. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall. Oh, no, I'm not going back there. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further. You won't win. You don't have the discipline. - You don't know how to fight together. - You don't know that. If you attack the Wall you'll die, all of you. All of us. I can't force them to meet us in the field. - Casterly Rock can't run away. - Can you do it? There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army. Walder Frey. We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs. Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters. - You were sent here to kill me? - I don't want to. What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them. Will you fight for me? The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours. - Is that the Blackwater? - Where do you think I'm taking you? - Back to King's Landing. - That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins. Your uncle's marrying one of the Frey girls. Your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you. That rain will cost us another day. Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight. - He's getting the wedding he wanted. - He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted. It's come for the baby. You stay back! No, you can't have him. No! Are you sure about this? No. It's dangerous. If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power. Why are you telling me? You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice. Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground, the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone. So Casterly Rock I'm asking your advice. We have enough men? If Walder Frey cooperates. If Walder Frey cooperates. If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before we take the castle we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea. We'll lose the war and die the way Father died. Or worse. Show them how it feels to lose what they love. My honored guests be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven. We thank you for your hospitality, my lord. I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness. Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls. One of them was supposed to be queen. Now none of them are. This is Arwyen my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra. My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila. Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care. My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter Wertha. Waldra. Waldina. - I'm Merry. - Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that. My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends. Very good. There she is. Come closer. Let me have a look at you. Still can't see you. Old eyes. Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Very honorable. I call it a pretty face. Mmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place. I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch. Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit. And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men. Thank you, my lord. Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us. Where? There. There. It's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves. Your men, but not you? I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property. This is where we enter the city. Very few guards. They know me. They let me inside We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate. I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates. Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours. Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways 'cause you've already slaughtered your partners. You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way. You command the Unsullied. What do you think? You leave tonight. Very good. We'll prepare. Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword. You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost, no matter our pride. We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big. Impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it in centuries most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens, I do. How do you know all that? I read about it in a very old book. You know all that from staring at marks on paper? Yes. You're like a wizard. Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive. Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking. The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning. - Need a hand? - Need about eight hands. Oh! Got to get this salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding. Many thanks. Don't! Don't kill him. Dead rats don't squeak. You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are. More than anyone you know. You're wrong. I know a killer. - A real killer. - That so? You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger. That him? - No. - Good. Don't kill him. Please. Please don't. You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed. Where are we? The Gift, I think. Brandon the Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that. Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment. It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave? Wildlings. Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women. Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it. That's what Old Nan said. There's a storm coming. I don't see any It's as good a place to shelter as any. We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much. Only one old man and eight good horses. What's one old man doing with eight horses? He breeds them for the Watch. How's he keep folks from stealing them? The Watch protects him. Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there. - And proper steel. - Let's carve him up. We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat. I keep telling you. He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear. The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers. I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do. Spread out. Surround the hut and move in. Ygritte! Clear the barn! No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all. Best part of the animal. Don't worry. They're still there. I know they're still there. You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move. I'm not afraid. Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot. I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire. When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl. And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop. That give you some ideas? Might do. Go ahead, then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck. Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull. How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high. How did you get past it? Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals. It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals. Some climb straight up the ice. Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back. Hodor. - Only three are still manned. - Hodor! One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through. My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted. Well, we'll have to open them up again. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - There's a rider out there. Just one? - There's more. - Hodor! Shh. Shh. - It's just thunder, sweet giant. - Hodor. I yield. - I yield. - Wildlings. Where's Shaggydog and Summer? Hunting. Hodor! - Shh, quiet, Hodor. - Hodor! Make him shut up. If they hear us - Hush, Hodor. No no more Hodoring. - Hodor! - Hodor! - Hodor, calm down. - You need to keep quiet. - They're gonna hear us. Hodor, be quiet. - Ah! Hodor! - Hodor, calm down. - Hodor! Hodor! - Hodor, be quiet! What did you do? Nothing. I don't know. What's that? That's a horse dying. Bring them over here. That was the last of them. The rest are dead. I heard shouting up there. Thunder. I know the difference between shouting and thunder. Maybe it's ghosts. That won't help you, grandpa. Where you riding? Doesn't matter now, does it? No, it doesn't matter now. Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here. You understand. Let me stand at least. Let me go with a bit of dignity. Make the crow kill him. You're one of us now. Prove it. The wolves are out there. I can't do it by choice. I don't know how. It happens in my dreams. You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood. I can't. You just did with him. A wolf is nothing compared to that. She looks sharp. Do it. Do it. I told you. He's still one of them. Go on, boy. Go on! He's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets. Kill him. - He's one of them. - No! Do you hear me? You're not gonna die for one of them. Do it. They'll find us if you don't. You were right the whole time. Hyah! When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler. The greatest in the land. Daario Naharis. That one was quick. - There may be others. - I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them. That's what you call a few guards? Come on! What do you got, huh? Lord Edmure I hope I'm not a disappointment to you. You're a delight to me, my lady. You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection. In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words. Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger - I am hers - I am his - and she is mine - and he is mine from this day until the end of my days. - Is that safe? - They're long gone. You were right. I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want. Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind. They can't do that north of the Wall? No one can do that anywhere. When I was looking through Summer's eyes, - I saw Jon. - Where? He was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him, but he got away. He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then. That's where we should go. For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack. - If this many wildlings got through - I already told you. I'm not going north of the Wall. Everything Jojen told me is true. You saw what I did to Hodor. I have to find the three-eyed raven. Listen to me, little lord. Don't worry. I'm not asking you to come with me. It won't be safe for Rickon. Me? I'm coming with you. No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you. I'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you. Right now I have to protect you. Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell. Would you know how to find the Last Hearth? You southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find. We're not southerners. And I don't want to leave you. Shh, shh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures. You don't have to do any of this. Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword. I know how to swing a sword. You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night. I learned to walk in darkness. Say your good-byes, little man. Keep this one safe. He means the world to me. We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city? It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered. And Daario Naharis? The city is yours, my queen. They're good, aren't they? They ought to be because they cost enough. Look at the crowd there. He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun, and now look at him. The gods love to reward a fool. - Uncle. - What? He's my nephew. I love him. And he's a damned fool. Don't you drink, Lord Bolton? Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses. That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls? Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat young bride. I hope she makes you very happy. Well, she's made me very rich. Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on. My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her. Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met. Be kind. She's finally starting to like you. And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand. Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake. Striking your king is an act of treason. No, don't. Don't insult them. Your Grace. The septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said, and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath. And a wedding needs a bedding. What does my sire say? To bed! To bed! To bed! If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them. To bed! To bed! To bed! Go on! Oh! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again. To bed! To bed! To bed! Poor girl. Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace. Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night. That is a very strange custom. I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective. It seems normal to you? It's a tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage. But there are other ways of providing proof. Boy or girl? I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him. Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming. Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses? I do. Go on, line 'em up! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? Got salt pork for the feast. The feast is over. Doesn't sound like it's over. If I tell you it's over, it's over. Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here. Got pig's feet, too. Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around. Your Grace. I feel I've been remiss in my duties. I've given you meat and wine and music, but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift. Robb! You ready to head home to Winterfell, right? Feast over yet, is it? Aye, it's over. Follow him. Aim! It's too late. The King in the North arises. Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please. He is my son. My first son. Let him go and I swear that we will forget this. I swear it by the old gods and new. We will take no vengeance. You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter! Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go. Robb, get up. Get up and walk out. Please! Please! And why would I let him do that? On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat. I'll find another. Mother. The Lannisters send their regards.", "summary": ["Plot Robb presents himself to Walder Frey, and Edmure meets his bride. Jon faces his harshest test yet. Bran discovers a new gift. Daario and Jorah debate how to take Yunkai. House Frey joins with House Tully.  Summary In Yunkai Outside the walls of Yunkai, Daenerys Targaryen and her commanders plan an attack on the city. Her newest captain, Daario Naharis, suggests a plan using a lightly defended back gate, a small group can infiltrate the city and open the main gates for the rest of the army to invade. Though Jorah Mormont is skeptical of both the plan and Daario's loyalty, Daenerys is convinced to try it when she asks Grey Worm if he trusts Daario. Upon being encouraged to speak his mind, he says he does. Daario also touches her on her hand, flirting for her favor to him. As the captains depart, Ser Barristan asks to go along, but Jorah reminds him that a Queensguard's place is at the Queen's side, regardless of his pride.  That night Ser Jorah, Daario, and Grey Worm sneak into the city and fight their way through the slave soldiers guarding Yunkai. There are far more soldiers than Daario anticipated, much to Jorah's irritation, but it seems that the three are evenly matched - barely.  A few hours later, an impatient Daenerys paces in her tent, asking Barristan how long a sacking of a city usually takes. Jorah and Grey Worm finally enter, covered in dust and gore but grinning widely: Yunkai is defeated. Daenerys is elated, but asks after Daario, who is still absent. After a suspenseful pause by Jorah, Daario strides into the room and kneels before the Queen. He presents Yunkai's torn flag and triumphantly says the city is hers.  At the Wall North of the Wall, Samwell Tarly and Gilly continue on their march south, after barely escaping an encounter with a White Walker during which Sam actually managed to kill the creature using a dragonglass dagger.  SamGilly Sam tells Gilly about a way to get through the wall.  Sam tells Gilly that they are a considerable distance west of Castle Black, but this isn't a problem, because this means they are close to the Nightfort, the original headquarters of the Night's Watch, which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization's numbers dwindled. Sam explains that he plans to get them across the Wall using a secret sally-port which leads right into the Nightfort. Gilly is amazed that Sam knows so much history just from reading books, insisting that he is a wizard (much to Sam's delight) and is awestruck when she finally catches a glimpse of the Wall.  Meanwhile, Bran Stark and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the Seven Kingdoms proper, and entered into the Gift: a stretch of land south of the Wall which was gifted to the Night's Watch thousands of years ago by Brandon the Builder, from which the Watch draws support for its material needs. The Reeds are puzzled, because the Gift possesses good arable land but the countryside is empty. Bran explains, to Osha's discomfort, that wildling attacks coming over or around the Wall caused most of the smallfolk to flee the Gift over the centuries. Meanwhile, the Watch's diminishing numbers mean they don't really need that much support from the Gift anymore, explaining why they haven't encountered any brothers of the Watch working the lands either. Bran's group takes shelter in an abandoned mill to get out of a thunderstorm.  In the Gift Nearby in the Gift, Jon Snow and the wildling party encounter an old man who lives alone at a small farm where he breeds horses for the Night's Watch. They plan to attack him to steal his horses and gold, but Jon insists that the old man is no threat to them. Orell and Tormund Giantsbane intend to kill the man so as to stop him from alerting the Night's Watch to their presence. However, when the party attacks the farmstead, Jon surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword, alerting the old man who flees; Jon also distracts Ygritte when she tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow. While in the mill, Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall, before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the old man is captured by the wildlings, Hodor \u2014 scared by the thunder \u2014 begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and cause him to pass out.  Summer attacks Wildling Summer attacks a Wildling.  Outside, Tormund moves to kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch, Tormund orders his men to kill Jon; Tormund restrains Ygritte to stop her trying to help Jon, and soon after Jon battles with Orell. At the urging of Jojen, Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, to aid Jon. Summer and Shaggydog kill two wildlings threatening Jon as he battles to the death with Orell and finally kills him. With the last of his strength Orell wargs into the mind of his pet eagle, which swoops down and attacks Jon, clawing him badly about the face before he beats the bird off. Jon then jumps to mount a nearby horse and escapes, leaving Ygritte and heading back to the Wall.  Jon kills Orell Jon kills Orell.  That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon (who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb) to Last Hearth, the home of House Umber, while he, Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-Eyed Raven. Osha promises to look after Rickon and orders the Reed siblings to do the same with Bran before she, Rickon, and Shaggydog depart in the dead of night.  In the Riverlands In the Riverlands, en route to The Twins, Robb consults with his mother about attacking Casterly Rock. Robb claims that it is a dangerous move, but if Tywin's castle is taken away from him - the lords of Westeros will realize he is not invincible. Catelyn points out that the plan requires the cooperation of Lord Frey, and in case reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before the castle is taken - the Stark host will be destroyed. She silently examines the map, and finally says in a harsh voice \"Show them how it feels to lose what they love\".  At the Twins Robb Stark's army arrives at the Twins, the castle seat of House Frey, for his uncle Edmure's wedding. Enduring Lord Walder Frey's insults directed at him and his wife, Robb makes a public apology to Lord Frey's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them. Frey accepts the apology and offers the Starks and their men his hospitality.  That night Edmure is introduced to his bride Roslin Frey, discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty. The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs, with all the participants in high spirits.  EdmureRoslin-1- Edmure and his new bride.  Edmure is clearly in love and his attentions are focused solely on his bride. As the celebrations reach their heights Lord Walder calls for the bedding ceremony. Robb agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed, Roslin carried off by the male guests and followed closely by Edmure, who is collected by the Frey women. Brynden Tully, having drunk too much wine, excuses himself from the celebration to \"find a tree to piss on.\"  After they leave and the festivities begin to wind down, Catelyn becomes suspicious when she notices Black Walder Rivers close the banquet hall doors and the musicians in the gallery begin playing \"The Rains of Castamere\" \u2013 the song commemorating House Lannister's decisive and brutal victory against the rebellious House Reyne of Castamere years ago. Walder rises to make a toast to Robb, and Catelyn, seated beside Lord Roose Bolton, notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing. Realizing they are in a trap, Catelyn slaps Roose across the face and screams a warning to Robb, but by then it is too late. Lord Walder signals his men to attack.  Talisa Stabbed Talisa is stabbed by Lame Lothar.  In what becomes known as the infamous Red Wedding, Lothar draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, killing her unborn child. Talisa collapses to the ground as chaos surrounds. Before he can react, Robb is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the floor. Numerous other Stark men are killed by the crossbow bolts or set upon by Frey soldiers. Catelyn is shot by one of the musicians in the back and falls to the floor.  Outside, Arya Stark and the Hound, having arrived at the Twins in disguise, are turned away by Frey guards at the time the massacre begins. Arya gives Sandor the slip and sneaks past the gate guards, only to witness Frey men kill Stark soldiers and Grey Wind, Robb's direwolf. She makes a desperate run for the castle, but is stopped by the Hound, who tells her that it is too late. When Arya won't stop, Sandor knocks her unconscious before carrying her out of the castle to safety.  Greywind dying Grey Wind is shot dead by Frey crossbowman.  A wounded Catelyn crawls to safety beneath a table as Walder motions the soldiers to cease their slaughter. Walder mocks Robb as he limps to his dying wife. He holds Talisa in his arms as she dies. Catelyn sees an opportunity and limps out from her hiding spot to seize Walder\u2019s cowering young wife, Joyeuse, from under his table. Catelyn holds a knife to the girl's throat and threatens to kill her if Walder does not negotiate an end to the attack. Walder refuses her, recalling the previous betrayed oath made that Robb would marry his daughter. She begs they take her hostage and that Robb, who merely lingers despondent and heartbroken beside his wife's corpse, be allowed to leave.  Catelyn kills Joyeuse Catelyn kills Walder Frey's wife, the Lady Joyeuse, moments before being killed herself.  He questions why he should agree to such terms to which Catelyn responds by swearing on her honor as both a Tully and a Stark that if he does not let Robb go she will kill his wife. Walder chuckles and nonchalantly responds, \"I'll find another.\" Robb stands and utters, \"Mother\" as \u200bRoose Bolton, who had fled the hall when the massacre began, seizes Robb, whispering \"The Lannisters send their regards,\" before stabbing him in the heart. Robb maintains eye contact with Catelyn as he collapses to the floor. Mad with grief at the death of her firstborn son, Catelyn cries out in anguish and kills Walder's wife, fulfilling her promise. Now catatonic with grief, she stands there and accepts her fate, allowing Black Walder to slip up behind her and viciously cut her throat. She falls to the floor with a thud."], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Shocking. Absorbing. Astounding. I'll start with the storylines then the filming then random thoughts and questions. I'm mainly focused on the wedding which doesn't mean the other storylines of Jon's betrayal of the Wildings or Bran's ability came out when pressed in a very beautifully told, freaked out moment with Hodor. Or Dany's storyline which was good too. THE WEDDINGWho are the savages?Red wine slips and sloshes on the banquet tables as rough-hewn glasses are roughly clinked. From a scene shot from the front of the hall, we see scraps of food littered in front of the tables on the floor. Coarseness, the juxtaposition of a celebration in a dirty place.\u00a0The breaking of guest rules was fundamentally shocking. It took place in the same hall that they had been drinking and eating moments before. Something deeply grotesque about treating these people as guests, sharing food and wine and then killing them in the same area they ate and drank.\u00a0 \u00a0The repeated stabbing of Talisa\u2019s womb. The general treatment of truly innocent Talisa. Brought forward like cattle to be examined. When they planned and executed to murder her with pinpointed cruelty. Shocking. Deplorable. \u00a0The Northerners are told stories about the Wildings; that they are these savage forest dwellers who drink blood from cups.\u00a0 They are grey and complex people just like the rest of GRRM\u2019s characters. Osha was so kind and loving towards the little Stark boys. She\u2019s been nothing but kind and patient with Hodor (\u201cHodor!\u201d) when he got upset. Orell may have been cast as bad but he was right. He was right to act the way he did towards Jon.\u00a0 \u201cAt least let me stand up to die\u201d said the horse-breeder to the Wildings. The Wildings allowed him to stand. \u00a0Compare that to the ambush of the Starks family by Freys. So nasty, so brutish.\u00a0 Catelyn standing up to die before being gutted like an animal (like a fish? like a pig?), the blood gushing everywhere. They killed her son, she kept her promise and killed an innocent. She had an undignified death, she was not allowed to die with dignity. \u00a0Random vs planned acts of violenceReminder of Balor (Season 1, Episode 9). Ned Stark\u2019s death. All this torment was triggered when Joffrey blithely ordered Ned Stark killed, almost off-handedly; the only planning an executioner with his sword at the ready.\u00a0On the chess board, the Lions\u2019 chess pieces all lined up against them, faces flat forward. This was not a chess board this was a butchering.\u00a0 The amount of planning Lord Frey must have gone through to pull this off. In an almost macabre way \u201cWhen the husband and wife leave, Fredrick, you shut the door. Now cue the band to start playing a creepy minor key song (Rains of Castamere). Then when I say and the signal, Peter, Jon and Hubert, you stab Talisa in the womb several times\u2026\u201d The way Walder Frey was watching the massacre as if he were watching a light play or a movie. Contrasts of matrimonial loveRobb Stark loved Talisa deeply. He foolishly broke his vow to marry the Frey daughter. The image of him crawling across the floor with arrows in his body to her broken body, to put his hand on her womb. Poor woman. Roose Bolton\u2019s distain, lack of caring about his wife, shocked Catelyn.\u00a0 Walder Frey couldn\u2019t even be bothered to save the life of his wife. Women don\u2019t matter to these men. Love doesn\u2019t matter to these men. Arya - what can I say?Agonizing. This alone makes me want to watch until the end of the series. I want to see some vengeance by Arya for the pain she's suffered. Hopefully, vengeance touched with wisdom. The scene starts with Arya looking across the water, afraid she will not get to the Twins in time to see her mother and brother. Arya's worst fear did come true. She almost saw her mother and brother. Almost. That closeness, the way she trotted through the castle gates light-footed with excitement. \u00a0Then, soon after image of Arya crouched in between the barrels as soldiers run by with bloody swords, held straight horizontal. They are ready to do more damage.\u00a0 The image of little Arya knocked out, flung over the Hound\u2019s shoulder while behind them the Winterfell encampment burns The Hound coming back for Arya. Knocking her out so she wouldn't rush off and tried to kill three guards before being slaughtered herself. She would have done it. She would have rushed into the fray. FILMINGPerfect imagesThis episode was so beautifully shot, I want to think on it some more. I will have to come back and write about it later, maybe in a blog posting. Perfect actingMichelle Fairley sets the bar for acting. She is an amazing actress. That woman can tell a novel with her eyes.\u00a0 I want to watch everything she does from now on, post-Game Of Thrones. The intensity of how she played that scene. It wasn't a scene, it was real. The truth of her throughout the entire episode, from reconnecting with her son to the final scene. And the final scene. The shock and rage in her eyes. The anguished wailing from Catelyn as she wanted to protect Robb and couldn't. The torment in her face as she saw her son Robb murdered in front of her. Catelyn. Dead stillness. She has died inside. We wait those few moments for what seems eternity. Please end, this scene is so awful. She is killed yet we know from her face, her body that she had already died.\u00a0  Perfect scenesThe music plays, low, minor-keyed and ominous. Catelyn looks up shocked \u2013 I learn later it\u2019s the Rains of Castamere. She grabs Bolton\u2019s arm, pulls back the sleeve and sees the sheet-metal. She slaps him and yells \u201cRobb\u201d.\u00a0MISC.Random thoughtsWhere is that Red Priest who can resurrect people? Catelyn\u2026.Arya and the Hound actually know each other very well.Rickon not wanting to leave Bran, wanting to protect Bran. Like Arya, in his mind, he is three times bigger and a hundred times stronger.Jon Snow not being able to kill a good man who is not in combat.Jon Snow pushing Ygritte aside immediately, Ygritte still hopeful, then her face, her face in the rain when she realizes that he\u2019s left her, so easily left her.QuestionsWhy did Bolton say \u201cThe Lannisters send their regards\u201d? Was he in contact with the Lannisters?The Bolton Bastard knows Rickon and Bran are still alive after Theon confessed during their pho-escape. Does his father Roose Bolton know? And do the Freys know?Did Ygritte kill the horse breeder so Jon wouldn't have to?", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Just saw it. Get ready, y'all.OK, so now that more people have seen it and the internet is ablaze, I'll add a few comments to this. I think it is fair to say that this is the part of the story all book readers were waiting for, and dreading at the same time, to see on the screen. They pulled it off pretty well, but I'll explain why I take a star off.Spoilers aheadFirst, the things I liked. Bran's warging was very well done - the scene with Hodor was a great surprise. I also liked Jon Snow's scene warning the farmer of the wildlings coming and making Ygritte miss the shot. Very nicely done, that. Arya + The Hound was perfect - they've done that extremely well. We all know Maisie Williams is great, but the guy playing Sandor is killing it too.What I did not like - Jon Snow betraying Ygritte. I think that scene just missed the urgency that I'd pictured when I read the book. It seemed like it was slightly rushed. They under-utilized Ygritte's acting capability at crunch time. Also, apart from the battle scene in Yunkai, nothing there stood out and was an unnecessary distraction. I wish they'd left out Dany from this episode.Now for the RW. The chapter describing this was a punch to the guts - I, and I think most other readers, were extremely affected when reading this, and it was this event that made these books like nothing else we'd read before. It is clearly the point where the conversion to die-hard fans of the series is complete for most readers.Keeping this impact in mind, the way it translated to the scene was a tad underwhelming. It was annoying knowing what happened in the books, for the first time ever. The pacing was fantastic - you could imagine sensing that something terrible is going to happen. The build up was very nice - the salt and bread, the other granddaughters, Roslin, and Edmure's reactions on seeing her and the look Walder Frey gives Robb Stark were awesome. The band playing 'The Rains of Castamere' was chilling and the buildup when the doors closed gave me goosebumps. Michelle Fairley's portrayal of Catelyn was spot on, she deserves an award for this. Arya being so close, but so far, was well handled too.BUT, it still missed something. Maybe it was the absence of Greatjon Umber's badassery of killing a number of Frey men. Maybe it was Grey Wind going down without a fight. Or maybe, it was just me feeling empty afterwards and nitpicking.", "\u2605This is the episode that made me decide to stop watching this series. i tolerated the violence and sheer cruelty until now because the sophistication and the production quality balanced it, but this specific episode made me understand that this series, is a pornography of cruelty and evil. It is now one of those very popular TV series that though their high production quality, i refuse to watch - series such as Dexter, where the \"hero\" is a psychopathic serial killer, and breaking bad, were the main character turns deeper and deeper into the abyss of crime and Spartacus.It is not just about the violence. It is about the triumph of evil. About the cynicism and lack of moral ethic of the characters.The phenomenon of such pornographic evil is growing and although real acts of such\u00a0 murderous and bloody behavior and utter lack of ethics were not uncommon in the dark days of Christianity and Islam (well... those days are not yet over for them, sadly) and exist even today, in some circles, in our over- capitalistic society, WE, as a society, should strive to evolve above and beyond that, as much as we can. While the way to do so is by harboring a mind that is less tolerant toward mind states that relish cruel situations and content that push our threshold of excitement/joy higher and higher, and thus making ourselves to numb and cynic to give compassion and sensitivity their right place in our hearts. The growing existence of such \"picturesque\" productions of gore and cruelty is\u00a0 exactly what we don't need.The real danger, is when such shit is disguised behind sophistication and thus it gives excuses to continue watching it. The production is responsible. There is a lack of creativity in many writers and creators that is compensated by the cheap mob entertainment herb: pornography and especially gore.People, don't be a Colosseum type of mob. We are better than this. Let there be shows that are creative and good enough that will entertain us without the need to show mutilating people, \"heroic\" serial killers, murder of infants and the like!", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I'm so happy for Samwell and Gilly. Really.At least there's one thing to be happy about. This episode had winter really coming. That wedding band really killed it tonight, didn't they?(some spoilers abound)I very much liked the execution of this episode, which started presumptuously on the edge of optimism and then went red as Walder Frey's wine. I commend the effort for keeping it slow and tense without falling into clich\u00e9d territory. The results are far more effective in this situation, and it paid off, slightly moreso now, having been disappointed for the first half of this season.The episode mainly focuses on the elegy of the Stark family sans Sansa.\u00a0 It started with every bit of melancholy and a bittersweet feeling of demise which served to fuel the nerves (Robb and Catelyn Stark in their sweet, little moment of reconciliation together was rather pale and mushy) and then as the minutes went by the viewers are slowly lulled into these tiny comical moments in order to hide the atrocity that is about to ensue during the climactic wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey.On the way to freedom is the youngest Stark daughter, Arya, who finds herself unwillingly together with Sandor Clegane in hopes to finally reunite with a part of her family that we've grown to care since the beginning. The whole episode revolved around this nostalgic feeling of wanting to finally reach a certain Homeward Bound-esque resolution for the Starks, and the viewers are intentionally led (or misled) just to reawaken us that we are watching this series because we want to see and hear about a wonderful fairy tale on how this family of honour and prestige struggled through the adversity of politics, of life, of circumstance and the harsh reality, and survived through it all.Unfortunately, no. We knew deep down in us they had it coming.\u00a0 We knew that during the course of this season and from the events that transpired, something like this is bound to happen. And we knew that this would never end without the sacrifice of blood. We knew it all along and we rode with it just so we can witness it ourselves. Robb Stark may have won all his battles, but let's face it, he's no gamer of thrones.Meanwhile, Bran Stark and company had a different reunion with family in mind. It certainly ties things up together. For a moment as well, we could almost taste it. Bran Stark and Jon Snow being merely one step away from each other. Bran had finally awakened his senses as a warg, having mastered it in mere minutes after his first few tries. We finally heard his youngest brother, Rickon, speak. A revelation that the little boy is neither meek nor nondescript. But just as he had his own moment of glory, we see him and Osha walk off into the moonlight and towards a safer path, hopefully. The next moment, we find our resident spy who knows nothing, Jon Snow, despite his minor struggles as compared to his family, once part of the wildling pack (even shortly), now back to being the bloody crow he was always sworn to be, leaving his crow-wife Ygritte in an awkward rut between obsession and pride, but not without avenging himself with Orell, who didn't seem to be that bad of a guy since he was, after all, right, yeah? Poor Orell finds himself warging to his bird-pal right before dying, since wargs can technically do just that.Daenerys' short scenes here felt like an afterthought, a simple out-of-place element struggling to find a time or place to belong. We see her repeatedly gushing over her newfound confidant, Calvin Klein, I mean, Daario Naharis, while him and Grey Worm and Jorah Mormont took down the city of Yunkai with relative ease, but not without showing some fanciful swordfighting and spearthrusting choreography here and there. However, none of her scenes really seemingly affected anything that matters except only to serve to boost her ego and libido. And, yes, of course, to free the slaves of Yunkai, or so she says.Certainly there are some scenes I wish I could have wanted to emphasise more for the non-book readers, in this case, since they at least showed it. One example is the ceremonial eating of the bread and salt at the beginning of the meeting between the Starks and Freys. In the books, this practice is more of a religious practice than a mere gesture of hospitality; to harm a guest once they have eaten your bread and salt is rather indecent or sacrilegious. Catelyn urged Robb incessantly to quickly munch the grub as soon as they arrive to ease her of that lingering discomfort. I understand that perhaps they opted for a less foreshadowing path just so we can eat our throats once the climax reaches its peak. Effectively it did, and you could almost taste my tears from this sentence itself, let alone the absence of any audio while the closing credits pass us by.Finally, before the end could even roll, we once again empathise with the rabid Arya Stark, who, for two episode nines by now, have been subjected to the death of another Ned Stark. Poor Eddard Stark. We should have known it all along after what that foolish girl Talisa named their unborn child. Now Arya finds herself yet again stranded in a crossroad and into uncertainty. Her path may clearly be doomed, but she will yet rise above it. Valar morghulis.Some minor additions:No Lannisters in this episode, but make no mistake: This is the biggest Lannister episode of all.Roose Bolton smiled. I repeat, Roose Bolton smiled.Walder Frey was perfect. That shrug was disturbingly funny.I hate Lothar Frey more than I hate Walder.Mary Frey was hilarious.Roslin Frey was perfect.Edmure Tully is a tool.It was the perfect moment for a fish to pee, otherwise we would have witnessed a very short-lived Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully.Sam the Slayer is now Sam the Wizard. You will be missed, Grey Wind.Why watch Jorah swing it when we could finally have seen what Ser Barristan Selmy is capable of? We've never even seen him pump it louder on-screen yet.No Stannis. Rightfully so.No Theon. Expect more of him on the finale. Now don't be sad, it will all finally make sense.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605Ever feel that things are going south to soon? That too much was happening at the same time. So much that you decide to take a walk, just to escape the suffocation; to stop, think and let your mind process the events in the right order of both- chronology and priority? That was my state when I first read the events of The Red Wedding.On TV though, I was simply disappointed (only a bit). When I pictured The Red Wedding in my mind's eye, through GRRM's narration, the flow of events from the celebrations of the wedding to the Quentin Tarantino style blood fiesta, was so smooth, ever so slight, that I actually had to turn back a few pages to see if I had somehow (hopefully) skipped a few pages and was reading the wrong chapter. The transition wasn't as smooth on the show. The bedding ceremony begins, the bride and the groom leave the hall, the musicians start playing \"The Rains of Castamere\", but the massacre wasn't immediate. There was just too much time lag- for Catelyn to recognize the song, of what it meant and of what was to follow. It wasn't supposed to happen like that. It was one of those \"calm one moment, chaos in another\" type scenarios that just wasn't milked for what it was worth.The actors' portrayal though was definitely impeccable. Michelle Fairley definitely deserves a standing ovation. Even if people who have never seen any of the episodes before started with the events of The Red Wedding, they would agree. The stabbing of Talisa in the stomach was a little too extravagant (she wasn't supposed to be there in the first place, she and Brynden Blackfish). The writers of the episode may have thought of including her to emphasize the injustice, the cruelty and the barbarism of the Freys and of Roose Bolton. But with the events that follow, they needn't have bothered. I suppose to the viewers that haven't read the books, it was a powerful catalyst in creating hate against the perpetrators, but to me, it was just one murder too much.I don't say they were wrong to use Talisa's killing as a rallying point to enrage the viewers. It's just that there was another contender for that already and they down-played it. The show never really emphasized on Robb's relationship with his direwolf, Grey Wind. Not that I enjoyed the way they executed him, but they could have just stuck to the books for this part of the show. Grey Wind isn't your average stray dog that you put down with just a few crossbow bolts. In the books, he actually takes down as many Frey men as he can before they finally get him. (When I was reading this part of the story, I was actually hoping he would break free from his chains and rescue Robb. But he doesn't and there I was- disappointed again. But that is what made me appreciate the genius that is GRRM. That's what they should have shown. It would have given the viewers hope that everything may not yet be lost- only to be disappointed again. To appreciate reality). The Stark wolves aren't just a piece of decoration on the show- the fact that the sigil of the Starks is the direwolf and that Bran, Arya and Jon can warg into their wolves isn't just a coincidence. That was one major setback. Apart from the time lag, between the bedding ceremony and the massacre, and Grey wind's execution, I have no other complaints. This was definitely one episode that had me feeling waves upon waves of goosebumps despite knowing already what is to happen. Satisfied but not overly excited about it-which is why I give it a three out of five.P.S: Did anyone else think Roslin was way more beautiful (and hotter) than Talisa??", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605It was bound to happen. Ned Stark had broken the very basic rule. You do not break the treaty with an ally when you already have very few of your allies left. He should have thought about it which he blatantly ignored. His mother had done another big mistake by releasing Jaime Lannister. She should have thought, that the king who cut her husband's head off without any treason would not let her daughters go gracefully in exchange of his Uncle(father)!Arya is safe outside all this. That's one big reason she is not dead yet or bound in a marriage, which is laugh of the town.And just imagine, if the penultimate episode is this, then surely something bigger than this can be expected in the last episode which can create more anxiety in everyone's mind about Season 4", "Certainly one of the best episode of GOT ... Second only to episode 9 of season 1 ...Reason of considering season1 episode9 the best is obvious : YOU DO NOT KILL THE LEAD ACTOR IN THE BEGINNING OF A MOVIE... N if u r doing it, u better give the viewers a reason to still watch the rest of the movie ... N GRRM certainly knows the way to keep his viewers glued to the seats ...N who says lightning never strikes twice the same place...Ask the Starks... Episode 9 season 3 proved to be one of those situations only... Killing not one .. not 2 .. nor 3 but 4 Starks ... U simply Dnt kill so many leads unless u r GRRM ...", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I was completely heartbroken when I saw this episode and frankly I didn't see this coming.. NOT AT ALL!!I genuinely like House Stark and especially liked Eddard Stark but the way things have unfolded on Starks, I feel sorry for them but I guess this is what they call \"The Real Game of Thrones\"The episode was directed with utter perfection specially \"Red Wedding\" - kudos to the director for that. This episode has no role of Tyrion for which I'm sad because he is the only guy I like now. Also no mention of Jamie. Arya acted very well here.I am desperate to watch the finale now. Sunday please come fast!!!", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I thought that was one of the most memorable episodes of TV ever.2nd-best episode of Game of Thrones ever (2nd only to Season 1 Episode 9).I can't remember an episode of TV where so many main characters are killed off all at once. I *never* saw the Red Wedding coming, even as the episode built up, which is the highest praise I can give.The pregnancy tragedy was especially brutal and real. Gasp. The tender exchanges between Robb/his mom and Robb/his wife made this episode truly heartbreaking.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Non-spoiler review in gif form.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Well i am not going into every details except the story(bcoz i think else-they do it perfect).Full points to story writer and director for gr8 screenplay and sudden outburst in the season.....When the sudden massacre happened, i was like - have i missed any episodes?? but then soon when i gained my conscience, i thought that it was getting quite boring to have starks still crawling and not reaching their goals....;), so good and also it leaves less members to be remembered int GOT.And next thing due to which i liked it was now there remains only one favourite contender for throne and that is khalisi....At last to wrap up thumbs up to whole GOT team...love your show very much.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605After watching the episode my reaction was :Gut wrenching to see Starks die one by one without even doing anything in return to harm Lannisters. Great episode nonetheless.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605It came in such a shock, especially since it wasn't the last episode of the season. I got used to be surprised at the last episode of the season. Besides, when I saw what happened, I just regretted not reading the book. This was the one part of the series that I haven't read. But all in all, I give this episode an honest, well-earned A*. Hands down, this was indeed one of the best finale ever done on a TV show.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I'm still in shock. I have never read the books, so the ending caught me totally by surprise.The killing of Robb's pregnant wife was\u00a0 particularly unnerving. I thought the ending credits w no music playing was brilliant and appropriate. Fantastic episode.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Pre-emptive.If they get this episode wrong (i.e. less than 5 stars), I'm not watching the series anymore."]}, "29": {"id": "s03e10", "name": "Mhysa", "script": "You will release every slave in Yunkai.

Just making a few alterations. No! Don't! The Nightfort's closest to Castle Black. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort. - Stop. - But your father-- I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to. What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins. He's a crow. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets. Kill him. The wolves are out there. You're a warg, Bran. Do it. I'm going beyond the Wall. It won't be safe for Rickon.

Here comes the King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! Here comes Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. What are you doing? I have a list. A list of people you mean to kill? For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand You should learn to ignore them. My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp. You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark. The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other. So how should we punish them? Who? Whom? Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert. I hear that you're a pervert. I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain. We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from. Lady Sansa! My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me. Why sheep shift? That's the vulgar word for dung. My lady Well, you asked me. Oh! That's him! My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council. Killed a few puppies today? Show him. Come on, show him. Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers. \"Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.\" Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something? Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast. Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage. A joke. Joffrey did not mean it. Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast. No. She is no longer yours to torment. Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster. Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies. I could have your tongue out for saying that. Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man. Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste. I am the king! I will punish you. Any man who must say, \"I am the king\" is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you. My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock! The king is tired. See him to his chambers. - Come along. - I'm not tired. We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest. Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep. I'm not tired! Come. Not you. You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper. You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros. A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king. You really think a crown gives you power? No. I think armies give you power. - Mm-hmm. - Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances. Which he got from me. Do you disapprove? I'm all for cheating. This is war. But to slaughter them at a wedding Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner. So that's why you did it? To save lives? To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood. The northerners will never forget. Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age. I believe you still have some work to do on that score. Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother? One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant. I will not rape her. Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works? Use small words. I'm not as bright as you. The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires. Does that amuse you? No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions. Easy for me, is it? When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family? The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister. Sansa. It's empty. Let's find a place to sleep. Hodor. Hodor. Don't, Hodor. Maybe we shouldn't stay. You'd rather be out there? There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories. I always quite liked the horrible stories. So did I. Once. You ever heard about the Rat Cook? No. Who's he? Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry. If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-- It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive. \"The late Walder Frey,\" old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun. The Blackfish escaped. An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. - Who does he have? - As you say. They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch? You'll be needing a new young girl. Yeah. Got that to look forward to. And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country. He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity? Well, here's to the Young Wolf! Forever young. Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over? At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins. Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing. I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon. Oh. And? Ramsay delivered the terms. The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay-- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things. Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock. What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage? People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock? Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch? Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples. But my father taught me to aim for their head. Kill me. Sorry, what? Kill me. A little louder. Kill me! You're no good to me dead. We need you. You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat. Stinking meat. You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name? Theon Greyjoy. What's your name? Th-- Theon Greyjoy. Please. What is your name?! Reek. My name is Reek. Hodor. - Don't kill me! - Who are you? - Sam! Sam! - Who are you?! Gilly. Don't hurt us. Where are you going? To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. - My brother, he's in the Night's-- - Shush. - Who's your brother? - Doesn't matter. You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window. No, I'm not. I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor. Hodor. I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will. Take us north of the Wall. What? Why in the world would you want to go-- I don't want to. I have to. How did you get through the Wall? Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here? Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black. Come with us. There's nothing north but death. If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you. There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that. What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way. You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead. How do you know all that? The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them. But you're going to stop them? Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to. \"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.\" Get that out of my sight. Theon disobeyed my orders. The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me. He's your son. Son? He's not a man anymore. He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy. Watch yourself. I've made my decision. And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet. I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands. Get those ropes! I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home. What is it? Dragonglass. We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them. Why? What are they for? Killing white walkers. How do you know that? The walker came for my baby. And Sam But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years. Well, I suppose someone had to be the first. Take it, Hodor. And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us. I wish I could. I really do. How are you keeping? Great. Never better. It was just a bit of blood. I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want. - I'm not a highborn. - She called you Ser. I heard it. A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you. Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help. I lived below the Street of Flour. How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you? The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door - on Gin Alley. - Gin Alley. The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king. Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me. If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her? You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you-- big words, no clothes. What would you have done? She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that. So how'd you become a lord? Oh, that's a long story. Better not, then. I'm a bit busy. Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this. You see? Highborns. I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept. Why did you? I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life. Does he? He's dead. How'd he die? Following me. When did you come to this strange country? When I was 13. You were only a child. I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that. You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking. And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot. She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault. I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me? No, I expect not. She's young and she's beautiful and highborn. We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-- - I have a name. - You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters. What do you want from me, Lord Varys? Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up. Why do you want me to leave? Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you-- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time. Lord Varys. If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself. Keep up. I don't think I can, my lord. It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy. Leave. So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend. She doesn't deserve this. Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world. There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher. Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit? I won't be marrying Ser Loras. I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage. You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child. So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it? So she can have some happiness in her life. You have children. How happy would you say you are? Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive. Even Joffrey? Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. \"We should have known. Even then we should have known.\" It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey-- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own. How long does it go on? Until we've dealt with all our enemies. Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more. Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time. I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat. - Aye, not for long. - That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal. I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body. - You sewed it on? - I did. I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one. It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-- What do you want? - Mind if I keep warm? - Fuck off. But I'm hungry. Does fuck off mean something different where you're from? I've got money. What kind of coin is that? It's worth a lot. Sorry. Little shit. Fool! Where did you get the knife? From you. Is that the first man you've killed? The first man. Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first. Valar morghulis. Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am. I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me. You know nothing, Jon Snow. I do know some things. I know I love you. I know you love me. But I have to go home now. I know how this must look. - What I meant was-- - I swear to you, my lord-- I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name? Gilly. Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely. Yes, my-- Maester. Master. Maester. And the child? She hasn't chosen a name yet. His name is Sam. Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order? He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us. Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall. Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-- Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay. Miles better. We had 44 ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight. \"To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded-- inv-- invit-- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit--\" Night. \"First night of the full moon.\" Why is there a G in night? I don't know. There just is. Well, your father's not going to go to that. My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday. I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life. \"His fangs were as long as bastard swords.\" Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. \"To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.\" - Noblemen. - \"Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig-- the Night's Watch implores\" What is it? Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked? Stay here. Bar the door. The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman. And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire? I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded. Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man. Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos? Aegon Targaryen. And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros? On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread. He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal. You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-- And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice. His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew. What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom? Everything. The boy must die. - What are you doing? - You're leaving. Is this some kind of trick? Yes, but not on you. Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater. I know not to drink seawater. Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you. Where should I go? You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing. The gold cloaks are looking for me.

Summary At the Twins At the Twins, the carnage at the Red Wedding continues to unfold. While the Northern lords are being slaughtered in the main hall, outside the walls of the castle House Frey soldiers ambush the Stark army in its own camp. What follows is not a battle but a one-sided massacre as the Northern army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies. The betrayers torch all of the camp's tents, with many men burning alive inside of them. Frey men wildly mutilate the dead and dying. From one of the twin towers of the Frey stronghold, Roose Bolton watches the massacre.  Robb Wind MHYSA new lightened Robb's corpse desecrated, with his direwolf's head sewn in place of his own.  Sandor Clegane attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse, along with the unconscious Arya Stark, by casually riding away while carrying a Frey banner. Before they can leave, Arya regains consciousness - as she and the Hound turn to see a group of Frey men shouting as they march through the main gate. The Freys have horrifically desecrated Robb Stark's corpse by decapitating it, then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf Grey Wind in its place. Drunk with \"victory\", the Freys gleefully parade the mutilated body around the castle on a horse while mockingly chanting \"King in the North! King in the North! Here he comes, the King in the North!\", which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of Frey soldiers.  Sandor is horrified by the gruesome spectacle, while he holds Arya, who looks on with a dead stare. The Hound rides away with her, undisturbed thanks to the Frey banner in his hand.  In the great hall of the castle the following morning, as servants clean up the pools of blood left by their former wedding guests, Lords Walder Frey and Roose Bolton gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them. Frey will become Lord of Riverrun, and the Freys will replace the Tullys as the Lannisters' vassals in the Riverlands. Bolton has been appointed as the new Warden of the North, replacing the Starks - though Tywin Lannister intends to eventually give the position to a future Lannister heir produced by Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark.  Bolton expresses his concern that Brynden Tully escaped the massacre, but Walder dismisses his worries, pointing out that the Blackfish - and the remaining Tully garrison at Riverrun - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the Lannisters, Boltons, and Freys, although Bolton is still visibly concerned. Bolton makes plain his contempt for Robb Stark, considering the late boy-king arrogant, politically incompetent, and unwilling to take Roose's advice and make the hard decisions needed to win. Walder questions Roose if he intends to rule the North from Winterfell, and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time, after it is rebuilt. This leads Walder to ask how Winterfell ended up a ruin. Roose explains that his bastard son Ramsay Snow offered Robb Stark's terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over Theon Greyjoy, but when they did they learned that Ramsay, in his father's words, \"has his own way of doing things\".  In the North At the Dreadfort, Ramsay Snow eats his breakfast of a thick sausage, taunting Theon about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood-stained trousers, and laughing as Theon finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare. Ramsay tells him that he is more valuable alive than dead so the answer must be no. Ramsay notes that Theon reeks, and decides that that shall be his new name: Reek. Theon refuses to acknowledge the name, twice insisting that he is Theon Greyjoy, but after Ramsay beats him, he finally breaks down and says his name is Reek.  In the Iron Islands Yara Season 3 Trailer Yara assembles her army to rescue Theon.  \u200bOn Pyke, Balon Greyjoy reads a message from Lord Bolton's bastard while his daughter Yara Greyjoy cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the Greyjoy kraken. As Ramsay's letter explains the box contains \"Theon's favorite toy.\" The message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the North or receive more bits and pieces of Theon. In addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive - just as Ramsay flayed alive Theon's twenty ironborn followers at Winterfell after they surrendered, even though he had promised them safe passage. It was in fact Ramsay Snow and his soldiers from House Bolton who burned Winterfell to the ground: he simply sent false reports for his father Roose to deliver to Robb Stark which claimed that the ironborn were responsible, as the Boltons were preparing to betray the Starks months before the Red Wedding.  Balon acts indifferent to Theon's situation since he defied Balon's orders and Yara's common sense when he stayed at Winterfell. Furthermore, he cannot further the Greyjoy line as the contents of the box prove. However, Yara does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother. She announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men, sail around Westeros, besiege the Dreadfort, and liberate Theon.  In the Riverlands In the Riverlands, a despondent Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane ride away from the outskirts of the Twins. They pass close to a small group of Frey men, one of whom is bragging about being one of the men who cut off Grey Wind's head and attached it to Robb Stark's body. Arya approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the fire. She offers the coin given to her by Jaqen H'ghar as payment. When the Frey man investigates, she stabs him in the neck. Slightly thrown, the Hound deals with the others before demanding to know where Arya got the knife. She reveals it's his. He admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that. As he grumbles and cleans up the bodies, Arya recovers the coin and whispers, \"valar morghulis\".  In King's Landing Shae Sansa and Tyrion Mhysa Sansa begins to form a friendship with Tyrion, despite their circumstances.  Meanwhile, in King's Landing, Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark walk through the gardens. A pair of passing gentlemen snigger at Tyrion, either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage. Sansa tells him to pay them no mind. Tyrion reminds Sansa that he's used to it, as he's always been a dwarf. He also states that he's not Joffrey, Tyrion would rather bide his time and humiliate them. Sansa playfully follows his line of thinking, and suggests \"sheep-shifting\"- secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress (as Arya used to do to her), so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung. Tyrion is amused but is confused by the term, though he realizes belatedly that Sansa has misheard the word \"shit\". He is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by Podrick Payne, who calls him to a meeting of the Small Council.  In Tywin's chambers Grand Maester Pycelle dithers over giving Tyrion a coded message from Lord Frey. Joffrey jubilantly explains its meaning that Robb and Catelyn Stark are both dead. Tyrion is visibly startled by the news, already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause, but Joffrey brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve Robb's severed head to Sansa at his wedding feast. None of the Small Council are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept. Varys points out that Sansa is Joffrey's aunt by marriage now (and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords).  A deeply embarrassed Cersei forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that Joffrey was only joking and did not mean it. This puzzles Joffrey, who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it, and he will have Robb's head served at his wedding feast. Tyrion flatly forbids it and tells Joffrey that Sansa isn't his to torment anymore. Joffrey angrily proclaims that he is the king, and everyone is his to torment. Tywin counters that any man who has to remind his subjects that he is king, is no true king. Joffrey goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather, deriding Tywin as a coward who hid under Casterly Rock while Joffrey's \"father\" King Robert won the real war when he overthrew the Targaryens. The entire Small Council tenses waiting for Tywin to respond to this shocking insult: instead Tywin coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the Queen Regent to see him to bed. Joffrey weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother, and Tywin also asks Pycelle to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep.  Tywin dismisses the rest of the council, save Tyrion, who drily notes that the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms has been sent to bed without his supper. He confronts Tywin about his part in the Red Wedding, and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it, as Walder Frey is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own. The Hand blithely confirms this. He dismisses Tyrion's concerns that the Northerners will never forget nor forgive such an outrage, arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again. Tyrion shows his distaste for Tywin's choice of a wedding as the place to inflict the slaughter, but Tywin responds, asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in battle is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a wedding.  Tywin again waxes poetic about family, noting Tyrion's failure to consummate his marriage to Sansa. Tyrion refuses to force himself on Sansa to do his duty, and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the Lannisters have murdered her mother and brother. Tyrion demands to know when Tywin ever put the family's interests above his own. Tywin retorts that he did exactly that on the day that Tyrion was born: he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea, but instead he spared him and raised him as his son, because he is a Lannister.  Immediately after leaving, Tyrion returns to his chambers and calls for Sansa, who simply regards him with a forlorn, tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death. Tyrion backs out, knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort.  Elsewhere in the Red Keep, Varys meets with Shae. He tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with Tyrion - and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for Essos to build a new, lavish life for herself. Varys is convinced that Tyrion is the last hope for the Seven Kingdoms' current regime, therefore Shae is a weakness that Tyrion, and thus the realm, cannot afford. Shae confirms that she is in love with Tyrion and that she cares deeply for Sansa as well, but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses, Shae will not leave until or unless Tyrion asks her to.  Jaime Mhysa finale returns Jaime returns to Cersei in the Red Keep.  Unknown to everyone in King's Landing, Jaime Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, and Qyburn finally arrive; the city folk do not even recognize Jaime after his long absence from the capital. They make their way to the Red Keep, where Jaime immediately calls on Cersei, who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand.  At Dragonstone At Dragonstone, Ser Davos Seaworth tests his new-found literacy on Stannis Baratheon's correspondence, declining Shireen Baratheon's invitation to read more tales of Aegon I Targaryen. He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word \"night\", before hearing the horns that signal Melisandre's intents to sacrifice Gendry. He argues with Stannis again about sacrificing the boy, but Stannis is convinced by Melisandre that using Gendry as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the Iron Throne. When he doesn't get through to his liege, Davos takes matters into his own hands and frees the boy, giving him a rowboat and directions to King's Landing. A furious Stannis sentences Davos to death but the Onion Knight produces a letter from the Night's Watch. Davos insists that it is Stannis' duty to assist the black brothers, and that he will need Davos's assistance to rally troops and mercenaries. Melisandre burns the letter and acknowledges the truth: the War of the Five Kings is irrelevant. The true war lies in the North, and evil and death are marching on the Wall. She also agrees that Davos has an important role to play in the events to come. Stannis sarcastically laughs at R'hllor's sense of humor, noting that the god Davos likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose.  At the Wall S03E10 - Bran Bran and the group go beyond the Wall.  Arriving at the abandoned Nightfort, Meera Reed tells Bran, Hodor and Jojen that the castle is safe to enter. While around the fire Bran tells the story of the Rat Cook, a Night's Watch member who killed a guest under his roof, a sin the gods cannot forgive. Later that night, Bran is awoken by a sound, and wakes his companions in time to see something large climbing out of the castle well; Meera attacks and overpowers the intruder, who is revealed to be Samwell Tarly, accompanied by Gilly. Sam quickly deduces Bran's identity by recognizing Bran's direwolf and Hodor. Bran asks Sam to take him and his group north of the Wall, and though Sam protests the idea, given the threat of the White Walkers and the undead horde they command approaching, he eventually relents and takes them through the passage. Before they separate Sam gives the group the rest of his dragonglass supply and tells them that it has the power to kill White Walkers. The groups then head in different directions; Sam and Gilly for Castle Black, and the Reeds, Hodor, and Bran beyond the Wall.  At Castle Black, Sam and Gilly meet with Maester Aemon, who is furious at the prospect of Sam having violated his vows. Sam defends himself by reciting the Night's Watch oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the Wall they are on and repeating Jeor Mormont's assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians. Aemon's demeanor softens upon learning that Gilly was one of Craster's wives, and acknowledges that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered. Aemon then orders Sam to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty-four of Castle Black's ravens are well-fed, as every one of them is to fly that night: the White Walkers have returned, and Westeros must be warned.  Stopping to rest and tend to his injuries after fleeing the wildlings, Jon Snow finds himself confronted by a furious Ygritte, who has an arrow ready to shoot him. Jon tries to talk Ygritte out of shooting him, insisting that he still loves her but that she should have known his loyalty to the Watch was never gone. Though his feelings are clearly reciprocated, Ygritte is still angered by his betrayal and shoots Jon three times with her bow as he flees from her, watching him go with tears in her eyes.  Jon is badly injured, but his horse manages to carry him the rest of the way to Castle Black, as he hovers in and out of consciousness. Having reached safety, Jon is brought inside the castle by the guards, where he encounters Sam and Pypar, who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of.  In Yunkai Dany Mother Mhysa The freed slaves thank Daenerys.  Outside the walls of Yunkai, Daenerys Targaryen and her advisors wait for the city's slaves to appear. Daenerys frets that the Yunkish slaves, who are better treated than Astapor's might have grown to like their chains and will not welcome freedom. Finally, the gates open and the freedmen pour out. Missandei begins to tell them of how Daenerys the Unburnt freed them, but Daenerys interrupts and says that it is the slaves' own choice to reach for their freedom. After a moment, one of the freedmen stretches his hand towards Daenerys and calls out \"mhysa\". After a moment, another follows suit, then another and another until the entire crowd is chanting \"mhysa\". Bewildered, Daenerys turns to Missandei, who reveals that the word means \"mother\" in the Old Ghiscari language. When the slaves advance on Daenerys, the Unsullied step into formation, but the queen tells them to stand down. Telling her dragons to fly, Daenerys steps out of the protection of the Unsullied and into the crowd, who carry on their chanting. Daenerys is embraced by the former slaves, offering a glimmer of hope in an increasingly darker and hopeless world."], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605This episode was a clear wrap up. It was a clean up after the gruesome massacre that was the Red Wedding. It also set the stage for the next season. I liked the overall pace of the episode- silent, not too emotional or exciting, mourning. I liked the way the scenes transitioned from one character to another that was being talked about previously. They showed Grey Wind's head on Robb's body! I was thinking that wasn't going to happen(but someone posted a spoiler image a few days ago). I wish they had shown a closeup of Robb's body with the direwolf's head. But the fact that the head was not stitched on properly was that much more defiling. If the head had been sitting perfectly on the body's shoulders, it would still have looked regal. I'm so glad they didn't continue with the scene showing Theon's castration from the previous time. All this gore makes me squirm. We finally know that his captor is Ramsay Snow, bastard son of Roose Bolton. And you have a of-course-which-other-family-could-the-psychopath-belong-to moment. The guy has such a charming face, but you just want to take a war-hammer and smash it in. Or at least give a slap(and get the hell outta there instantly). The scene with the sausage was just utterly gross. Great acting. There's not a lot of characters you really hate, but this is one of them.Another character you want to slap is Joffrey. He's an annoying gnat you just want to flick away with your fingers because he's distracting you from the important things to be discussed at the Small Council.\u00a0 (I still hate the fact that they showed him as a murderer(Ros) which was not in the books).\u00a0 His scenes are always handled carefully with just the right amount of humor, and this was no exception. It's wonderful to see him being put down, and more often than not, it's Tyrion who's doing that. Even in the books, their exchanges were witty and chuckle worthy. Tyrion and Tywin always manage to have the best lines- clear and sharp. \"Any man who must say 'I am the King' is no king\" was a punch in the gut for the whiny little boy. \"You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.\" was a laugh. And Tywin's retort was witty and powerful as ever - \"You really think a crown gives you power?\". And the moral conundrum he poses : \"Why is killing 10,000 men on a battlefield more honorable than killing 10 men at dinner?\" Tywin is the real ruler and knows how to gain power. He's a sneaky bastard who resorts to trickery and has recently stooped to a really low level, but he has the real power. Not Joffrey, not Cersei, not Tyrion, but Tywin. Ygritte and Jon Snow have a clashing of honors episode. Jon goes on to explain why he must go back although he loves her. It is his honor and duty. Ygritte stays quiet the whole time, listening, and her notch on her arrow speaks in reply. When Jon, finally confident that she will not shoot because he has explained to her about his honor turns back, she loses an arrow without saying a word, but effectively telling him that it is now her honor and duty to shoot him. He betrayed her, and if she lets him go, she will not be doing her duty. She is a wildling out and out, after all. But with every arrow she shoots, you can feel her pain and rage and her want to hurt him- hurt him like he hurt her. It was gut wrenching to watch. It would have been an outrageously tactless move by the producers had they left Jon's life as a cliffhanger this season, but thankfully, they showed that he is alive. Ygritte's expressions were a perfect ten on ten. The Jaime - Cersei scene could have been done much better(in the books, Jaime comes back much later, and they impulsively have sex), but Jaime's hopeful stare and the look of revulsion on Cersei's face as she looked at Jaime's arm conveyed a lot about the nature of their future relationship. When Jaime looks down at his stump, you could almost hear him say, \"You too take me now for a cripple and feel disgusted because my hand is chopped off, Cersei?\"Yet another character who conveyed a lot with his expressions alone was Tyrion. He had just gotten Sansa to talk cheerily with him, and is so hopeful that they can get through this together after all, when he sees her tear-stained eyes. The guilt in his face is palpable. Both Tyrion and Sansa's expressions were also perfect tens. Arya and the Hound were, well, what can I say? Awesome. Arya is one headstrong girl, a fighter and a survivor. There is so much anger in her. And so much has been taken away from her. She is going to do everybody in one day, you just know it. I loved the way she used her filthy appearance to get the man to face her before she stabbed him. Looks like the Hound has some new-found respect for her.Bran's Rat Cook story talks about what a lowly act killing guests is. It leads us to hope that Lord Frey is going to meet a gruesome end. Bran meeting Sam was a wonderfully positive feeling for the viewers. Sam's re-recital of the vows to Maester Aemon makes you go, \"Aww shucks!\" because you really want Sam and Gilly to get together. The very implied manner Sam convinces Maester Aemon about the white walkers was in complete contrast with his lines with the blunt Jojen Reed. Sam has become even more endearing, if that's possible.There was a lot of defying going on too. Joffrey, of course, was stupid in telling his grandfather that he hid under Casterly Rock while Robert killed Rhaegar. (For those who do not know, when Robert killed Prince Rhaegar, Tywin was a recent Hand of the Mad King Aerys. Using his calculating and dishonorable methods, he marched into King's Landing, welcome, and sacked the city. Jaime then slew Aerys, but for honoroble reasons. Lannisters killed the king, Robert killed the prince.) The scene with Varys and Shae was surprising and unexpected. Lord Varys does not concern himself with smaller beings who are not a big part of his plans. The fact that he came to talk to Shae and tried to bond with her using the we-are-both-aliens-here lines show that there is something important he wants to do and Shae is hindering that. He went as far as paying her to leave, and she defied him. You can't help feeling she's going to pay for it. Either that, or she has ulterior motives. Or is just plain stupid. Her story should be interesting to watch out in the next season. I really liked how Ser Davos connected with Gendry. The scenes between them provided a light comedic relief to an otherwise sombre episode. Davos also openly defies Stannis and sends the boy to safety. He is defiant still when Stannis pronounces his death sentence, and it was relieving to watch that the guards don't react immediately. Melisandre wasn't upto her usual tricks this time. She very tactfully played with Stannis and ended up having Ser Davos serve in her army. It was an ultimate, personal insult to him, and a triumph for her. But I was not too convinced with Melisandre switching sides in an instant. How did she not see in her fires that the North is in danger? I did not really like Yara's portrayal in the series. She is much more playful and spunky in the books. And I definitely don't like that they showed her going against her father. Balon Greyjoy did not favor Theon for sure, but in the books, Asha was his favorite. Ah, well. At least, it was well done. Balon's lines went on to reinforce the disregard many kings and lords hold for their own family. Walder Frey talks along the same lines about his wife. These people value power and wealth over their own kin. Ironically, it is the man who has power and wealth who values his family members. Tywin's statement to Tyrion about his childhood was completely unexpected. It left you feeling even more confused for your feelings towards Tywin. Cersei's lines about motherhood were moving, especially when she described how even Joffrey cannot take away how she used to love Joffrey himself. She conveys clearly how much she used to adore him, and how she's still clinging on to that memory of her sweet little boy, despite the fact that he's now a monster. Cersei is a mother. Her lines give her actions a little bit of retribution and viewer sympathy. But that went away the instant we saw her judging Jaime for his broken hand. Yet another character shows that power and looks are more important to her than the love he bears her.Dany's scene was completely over the top. I did not like this at all. Frankly, the expressions on the faces of the extras were just not believable. It was too overdone. She has been exalted to the status of Mhysa, but not tastefully. However, the closing CGI scene was quite impressive.I think pretty much every major character and every plot was covered in this episode. Overall, a good ending to the tumultuous season.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605MothersAs we learn at the end of the episode, Mhysa means mother. This is a reference to Dany and how she was received by the newly liberated people of Yunkai. We also get a taste of the relative happiness Cersei gets from being a mother, even of Joffrey. This is in stark contrast to where we were left at the end of the Red Wedding, bearing witness to the most abject horror a mother can have\u2013Catelyn seeing her child and unborn grandchild slaughtered before her eyes. The contrast is a bit twisted; on one hand, there's some hint of happiness left in the world. On the other, we are in fact just gaining more insight into the joy that was completely eviscerated at the Red Wedding. It's as if the producers are setting us down gently but subtly reminding us not to forget.FathersHowever, another major theme of this episode is fathers, and how poorly they receive their own sons, intentionally (Tywin, Balon) or otherwise (Roose, Davos). Just when you think Tywin couldn't be a more cruel father to Tyrion, he reveals to Tyrion that he would have drowned him right from the beginning were it not for the fact that he is a Lannister. He keeps pushing and pushing on Tyrion, and you can't help but think that Tyrion is going to eventually push back, in a cumulatively forceful way. This will be the dynamic to watch next season.\"Just Like You\"The rest of the episode is melded together by unlikely pairs that hold more in common than either would think. Davos and Gendry, Arya and the Hound, Varys and Shae, Bran and Sam.It's clear that Arya's been pushed over the edge; the amount of inconsolable anger she has makes the Hound look timid by comparison. This is the other storyline to keep a close eye on in season 4.At the end of season 2, we were teased with a looming threat that seemed bigger than all of the petty politics going on in the South. At the end of season 3, it's still coming, and no one's really done anything about it. They're just starting to get their shit together at the Wall, and it's unclear if anyone's going to take them seriously.Let's get one thing clear\u2013the Red Wedding was the true end of this season. However, this episode was necessary to placate distraught fans and lay some extremely early groundwork for the next season. I thought it was OK, but relatively speaking, it's impossible to have followed up the previous episode with anything nearly as good.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Once you accept that there aren't a lot of Big Happenings in an Episode 10, and it's more about moving pieces around the chessboard to set up next season, I thought it was a brilliant episode in terms of the character interactions.THE GOODThe Small Council scene was probably the one that sticks out most because it's Tywin Lannister at his best and worst. Smacking down Joffrey like the petulant child he is was was fantastic, but you can tell Joffrey struck a nerve -- \"winning a war with a quill and ink\" and \"hiding under Casterly Rock\" are really two sides of the same coin when it comes down to it. It's two perspectives of Tywin's leadership style. And then Tywin's heartbreaking answer to Tyrion's question at the end of the scene just blew me away. (And as an extension of that scene, the despair of that scene after when Tyrion returns home to Sansa, understanding just how hopeless and trapped they are... sometimes it's amazing what these actors can accomplish without even any lines.)Arya's big scene. Is it just rage or a moment of clarity? There aren't going to be any reunions. Robb's not going to lead a Stark army to cross those names off that list -- if anything the list just gets longer and longer, unless she takes matters into her own hands. The Hound's reaction is a touch toward \"buddy cop movie\" territory, but still. I don't recall the scene between Varys and Shae in the books (it might have been there, it might not) but I thought it was a nice little add. I always like when Varys' humanity shows throw and he's willing to set aside his Master of Spies hat to help his friends* (and his respect for Tyrion was nice to see), and he can see that Shae hanging around can't POSSIBLY end well for her, Sansa, or Tyrion. Perhaps he's still stinging from what happened to Roz.Lena Headey also brought her A game, both in the scene with Tyrion where she lets her guard down a little about Joffrey, and when Jamie returns. You can tell, even now, just from her expression at seeing him again, that things won't ever be the same between them. There's no running into each other's arms -- more of a mutual \"who the f*** are you\"?I thought the Stannis-Davos-Melisandre storyline was a little uneven, but ultimately hit some good notes. It was nice to see Davos stand his ground and set Gendry free, even knowing it would cost him his life. And you know what... for as much as we get the vibe from Stannis like he only wants the throne because he's next in line, the line where he says (paraphrasing) they made his kingdom bleed and he'll use any weapon he can to pay them back... at least it shows he's got a beating heart and isn't just the Stannis-Bot 2000.THE LESS-GOODFor the most part, I didn't dig the scene between Jon and Ygritte. I guess I wonder a little... did she shoot to kill (three shots and not one hit in a vital spot?) or did she shoot to hurt him for leaving her behind. All that said, \"I love you and and I know you love me\" made Anakin Skywalker look like a smooth talker.I just don't care much about the Theon subplot, though his dad is one cold S.O.B. I'd care a bit more about his sister being all gung-ho to find him if they'd developed that relationship a little more.I thought they'd do a bit more with Daenerys than just have another YAY MOTHER OF DRAGONS! scene. Maybe explore the ramifications of Jorah getting friend-zoned in favor of Daario or something... they were hinting at that in Ep9.Less Sam and Gilly, please.SUMMARYA lot of interesting exploration of what family means, and to a lesser extent, what a highborn name gets you.There's a whole lot of highborn people being intolerably cruel to people within their own families. One king is willing to serve his uncle's wife the head of her dead brother at a wedding just to find some way to take credit for his grandfather's victory. That same grandfather tells his son his one great sacrifice for the family was not murdering him as an infant. Another \"king\" (Stannis) is willing to burn his nephew alive to make some deal with mysterious powers. A third king (Balon Greyjoy) is willing to sacrifice his son to torture. Walder Frey has a good laugh about murdering his son-in-law's family and holding him hostage in a dungeon.Meanwhile, it's the people who don't have a name to trade on that treat each other decently -- either they're lowborn and don't have one at all, or in some cases they're high-born, but their name doesn't help them much. Davos saves Gendry at the risk of his own life. Sansa (family dead) and Tyrion (the black sheep of his family) are both trapped but there's at least some kindness there that neither gets from anyone else... well, except Shae, but that's awkward. Varys tries to get Shae out of the line of fire. Arya and The Hound have reached a peace for the moment. And no one's rallying behind Daenerys because of the Targaryen name -- they're following her because she's offering freedom to people who never had it.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I want to talk acting here.\u00a0 One thing I like about science fiction and fantasy on film is that actors are given really interesting challenges, their characters are placed in extraordinary circumstances and they must come up with a way of reacting to these circumstances that pulls a viewer in through empathy, compassion, even revulsion which works best if one can understand the humanity behind a terrible act.\u00a0 The Red Wedding is arguably the most horrifying scene in television history, yet Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister contextualizes the murderous acts in that scene as understandable moves in 'The Game'.\u00a0 As Tywin and Peter Dinklage's Tyrion spar over the morality of the events past and those proposed for the future you got to see two excellent acting performances, characters so finely tuned that the fantasy aspects of the story are transcended by the humanity revealed.\u00a0 Tywin is tied to duty, duty to the family.\u00a0 If that duty requires brutality you apply it.\u00a0 And if it requires mercy, mercy for a deformed infant, you apply that as well.\u00a0 It was the revelation of Tywin's act of mercy that left Tyrion speechless.\u00a0 Damn!\u00a0 Great stuff!Yet the brutality of The Game isn't so easily brushed aside.\u00a0 When Tyrion goes to Sansa he is obviously conflicted.\u00a0 They must talk.\u00a0 But when he whispers her name and she turns her head words fail him.\u00a0 This was what we actors call a moment.\u00a0 Her glance is fleeting, lasting mere seconds, yet upon her face can be seen unutterable sorrow, grief beyond words, and yet, around the edges, defiance.\u00a0 Sophie Turner has taken a character that was initially as deep as water on a plate and made of her a well, with darkness and light within its depths.Duty again asks a terrible price, paid by Jon Snow and Ygritte.\u00a0 He broke his vow, fell in love with her and took that step too far.\u00a0 But he can't escape the vow.\u00a0 When Ygritte looses her arrows she does so with more than the simple rage of the spurned lover, she has duties too: to her people, to herself and to the stark code of the warriors beyond The Wall.\u00a0 Both Rose Leslie and Kit Harington were able to produce a wonderful chemistry between their characters.\u00a0 Such chemistry can be very elusive, but when it's there it can be so sweet.\u00a0 And that sweetness makes the severing of their bond all the more tragic.There was great acting all over this episode-Lena Headey's Cersei reveals layers that include a blunt cruelty, a mother's love for a monster that was once the light of her life and a practical sense of the way things are for a woman in her position.\u00a0 The actress has been able to bring us a villainess at once evil, yet understandable in her motivations.Sam and Gilly have an unusual relationship in that it is platonic, something rare in nighttime drama.\u00a0 John Bradley and Hannah Murray are so easy with one another, so comfortable.\u00a0 It's quite lovely.I loved the scene between Davos and Gendry where we get insight into the lowborns of the realm.\u00a0 Too often in epics the worldview presented is based on the elites, the ruling class, with little attention paid to the lives of lesser folk.\u00a0 Liam Cunningham and Joe Dempsie develop a nice camaraderie and provide a window onto the gutters and back alleys of Westeros.The relationship developing between Arya and The Hound, Maisie Williams and Rory McCann, looks to be one of the most promising aspects of season IV.Gemma Whelan set the stage nicely for next season as Yara Greyjoy.\u00a0 I thought she asserted herself with a steely resolve.\u00a0 She got a lot across in a few moments.I'm a sucker for any freeing of slaves stuff so I continue to find Emilia Clarkes' Daenerys compelling.\u00a0 Her growth as a character has been nice to watch.So I give the episode 5 stars mostly for the acting.\u00a0 The piece as a part of the story had a definite epilogue quality to it after the earth-shattering events of the previous episode.\u00a0 But dang, the producers of the show packed a bunch of fine acting performances into 'Mhysa'.", "\u2605\u2605Spoiler alert: Khaleesi still isn't going anywhere close to Westeros soon. Sad really.The final shot was disappointing that I clenched my nerd hands wishing I could have done a more satisfying finale (not that I could) than the one they offered. Seriously, I have no idea why they opted to go for the campy Daenerys Targaryen and The Three Musketeers storyline to close the season. There were far better opportunities to be had, especially now that so many things make a wee bit of sense. The 'oh shit' moments of the first and second season finales got buried along with the forever young. I personally would have opted to go with Coldhands or Stoneheart (wink).The episode overall felt wrought with anticlimax. The only thing that worked basically is tying the knots together for those less fortunate to not have read the books. Yet there was nothing for me to be excited about for the long wait. Some events here are even misleading and perhaps giving a false sense of hope for some characters and viewers alike. It feels as though they gave me desserts without a main course, especially after having blown away by their specialty last week.There were things I did really like though; reappearances of relevant secondary characters; Aemon Targaryen, Pyp, and Balon and Yara Greyjoy. It definitely proved that it's better not to see characters for some time rather than cram them into an episode with little to no relevance.The Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane duo in this episode was short but not sweet. After the shocking events of the previous episode, a man would expect to see the transformation of little tomboy Arya Stark channelling her killer instinct. Note that this isn't the first time in this series that Arya had killed a man, but this time she finally did it out of spite, absent empathy and emotion, as The Hound cheers on from behind. The Theon Greyjoy saga finally came to a conclusion, but was it satisfying? It reeks of ugh and gives us more headaches than palatable answers.Jaime Lannister's return to King's Landing was sweet, especially how amazed Qyburn and Brienne were at the sight of all that hay and marble. Duh. The dynamics between Tyrion and Tywin Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon held this episode on its own. It will definitely carry on to the next season. The North remembers and there will be pies to eat.Meawhile, it's good to finally hear that the Stannis side of the story is propelling forward. It's very disappointing to say farewell to Gendry though (or is it?), not just because he is an important figure but the actor really gave him the credence to become one. It is also disappointing to realise that Shireen was shown in this episode just to show Davos why there is a letter G in the word night.Bran and company now find themselves in an interesting journey yet still feels shallow and bizarre for my taste. They just walked all the way from start to finish, and a scare for their lives now and then could have spiced things up.Then Jon Snow confronts Ygritte for what could have been a schmaltz run, but instead we see a more dramatic exit for our wildling-loving crow, who sees return to Castle Black, but not before receiving three arrows to his body. Either Ygritte is trying to say 'I love you' or 'You know nothing' for each arrow, both still applies.Then finally we see a view of a short-lived optimistic Sansa who received word of her ill-fated family in the brink of extinction. If the screen hung on for another five seconds there I would have shed a tear, but thank you for sparing me that liberty.This episode in its entirety to me feels representative of the entire third season. Mildly engaging and interesting banter topped with a death of two here and there.\u00a0 We get to see Yunkai finally liberated, but, hey, who cares about Yunkai when the war had ended on the other side of the continent? These talks of dragons and slaves pale in comparison to some deaths of wolves.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Overall a good, satisfying episode. More subdued but well-written,all scenes subtlety stitched together.\u00a0 Almost musically paced exact, like a metronome. Third episode in a row written by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss. The visual cutovers this week were impressive \u2013 like . It didn't have a cliffhanger ending like the finales of Season 1 with the birth of the dragons or Season 2 with the attack for the whitewalkers. Most likely because, as a friend pointed out, it's really like the middle of Book 3.\u00a0THEMESMothersDany, mother of the dragons and now to the freed slaves. Sam bringing Gilly, a mother, to Castle Black, Cersei and her talk of being a mother will bring happiness to Sansa and then her own brief happiness with Joffrey when he was everything to her. Even Yara who was acting like a mother to Theon by going after him (I believe she said once she remembered him as a little baby)Kickass womenArya attacking the men, Yara decisively to the rescue, Meera coming across the plains with her arrow and the direwolf, Ygritte who acted accordingly even if Jon Snow is to be the hero, the Red Priestess who I understand more and more is doing this because she believes its rightUnlikely alliesArya & Sandor (an orphan and an unlikely father-figure), Davos and Gendry (a man who\u2019s lost his son and another orphan). The Red Priestess taking Davo's side.Feigning weaknessArya dropping the coin, Grand Maester Pycelle playing feeble and dropping the scroll with the important news.CloakingEdmure Tully easily cloaks Roslin; he couldn\u2019t protect himself against a surprise attack and is in a dungeon. Tyrion couldn\u2019t cloak Sansa without her help but he protects her against Joffrey\u2019s cruel plan to present her with her brother\u2019s head. And he stands up against his father against raping her to pass on the family line.FAVORITE SCENESArya and Sandor taking on the Frey menArya was unexpectedly resourceful. She reacted emotionally on overhearing the man boast how he (and a couple of other guys) stitched the wolf\u2019s head to Robb, her brother\u2019s body. When she jumped off the horse and crept up behind him, I thought she was going to attack him immediately. Instead, she approached the situation with cunning, using her lost orphan status to her advantage \u2013 \u201cI just want some food\u201d then fumbling and dropping the coin before savagely knifing him to death. The vengeful death was satisfying.\u00a0 She still doesn\u2019t think it all the way through though \u2013 what was she planning on doing with the other three men? I don\u2019t believe she had thought it through to have Sandor follow her. Though she was resourceful enough to steal the knife before she needed it.The coin! The phrase! I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what happens to Arya from here on out.Earlier, the image of Arya\u2019s eyes displaying aching horror and pain when she saw the cruel defiling of Rob\u2019s body with the wolves. Sandor thinking quickly and grabbing the Frey banner to charge out of there.Yara Greyjoy standing up to her father and leaving to rescue TheonBalon Greyjoy is not a wise man. He repeatedly made bad choices which put his children directly in harm\u2019s way: killing two sons for a stupid rebellion, then sending Theon off to take the North.\u00a0 That Balon wasn\u2019t going to take any responsibility for Theon when he was in desperate need just galled me. I loved that Yara stood up to him, I thought she was going to push him in the fire at one point. And I loved that she took the fifty top killers and marched onto the ship.What and how Balon said with disgust that Theon wasn't a man, couldn't do anything for the family line, that must have impacted Yara, a woman. Tyrion and Sansa The walk in the gardens was bittersweet, as we knew it was to be ruined. Her joining in on his side to find a revenge. Her sharing of her childhood experience with Arya and the sheep dung in the bed. It shows she\u2019s not far from there, still a child, yet oh so far away. Sansa on the window sill, looking out the window, then turning to reveal a face red raw and covered in tears. I almost wish he\u2019d gone to her when she was crying\u00a0 - I know he couldn\u2019t have, could he?The small council meetingPerfect, there was a whole season in this scene from Joffrey\u2019s smarmy strut and disgusting suggestion, to Tyrion\u2019s defence of Sansa, to Cersei\u2019s powerlessness to rein in her son\u2019s impulses, to Tywin bringing order by sending the King to bed without his supper, to Tywin and Tyrion\u2019s buildup of tension.The acting in the scene where Tywin says he wanted to walk the baby Tyrion into the sea. Such intensity. I felt for Tywin's character and Tyrion.Shae and Vary\u2019s character developmentThat scene said much about both of their characters. I\u2019ve really come to like Varys. I believe he does want the stability of the kingdom and can predict using his hard-ended wisdom. He\u2019s a strategist. He's imploring her to leave based on his experience and knowledge.\u00a0 I loved the beautiful backdrop of the sea and the orange and yellow awning. So tranquil and beautiful for conflict in the scene.The musicWorth a call out on it\u2019s own. Beautifully done with the music overlaid Dany\u2019s being carried on the arms of her new people.ALMOST, NOT QUITE SCENESShae's character, she bothers me. What is her end game? Does she really not know Tyrion well-enough that he'd never send Varys? The scene with Jaime coming into Cersei\u2019s room. It just wanted something from the filming and the timing. Last episode, the camera lingered exactly right. This scene just didn\u2019t have tempo or setting or something. I wanted this to be more and it just wasn't.Dany\u2019s scene. It didn\u2019t work. For some reason, it just didn\u2019t work. It had everything \u2013 from gorgeous almost edible music to beautiful scenery, and yet, it felt kind of cold to me.DISLIKED The grotesqueness of castration by the Bolton Bastard. Ramsay Snow castrated Theon in a horrific awful manner. Blood, eating the sausage, even just being there. Overdone. The scene with Yara receiving the box would have been perfect on it\u2019s own. We could have all understood.RANDOM THOUGHTSWho told Sansa of her brother and mother\u2019s deaths? Who would have known? Only the small council right? Joffrey was taken to bed and given milk of poppy by Grand Maester Pycelle. Cersei was in her room, playing with seashells. Varys was talking with Shae?The defiling of Robb\u2019s body with the wolf. This is heinous and yet other cultures even today, this happens. I remember my grandfather being very upset that a policeman\u2019s head was put on a spike in England. Why does this happen? I\u2019m not sure if I really want an answer.Are sociopathic babies any different from other babies? I know there are sociopath indicators in children like tormenting and killing small animals, setting fires.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605Thanks for the A2A Marc. Note: I'm coming at this as a reader. I won't spoil, but clearly my expectations are based on a continued love affair with the books beyond this point.I thought the end here was adequate but not more. To me the best season of GoT is still Season 1 and I say that so freely because all three seasons have ended formulaically with an epic climax and then an attempt at a smaller peak which acts to induce catharsis.In Season 1 we had the second best climax (Headless Ned), but the catharsis was stunning. Seriously, Dany walks out of a fire wearing nothing but fresh dragons? Praise to the Old Gods and the New.Season 3 has the best climax with the Red Wedding - a singular moment in TV history for me - my lord if I had any power to say who got Emmies, Michelle Fairley would get one - but the final episode kinda drifted a bit.The catharsis is supposed to be Mhysa Dany, and it's a good scene, but it's not really enough for me. You had other things that made it in the episode which didn't fully hit. Jaime seeing Cersei for example maybe could have been an amazing moment but they both seemed to just wait for the camera to switch away.The good:Cersei advising \"giving\" Sansa a kid and then talking about her own gratitude for her kids. Wow.The Hound bailing out Arya and then telling her to give him a head's up next time...she decides to murder a group of men they pass by. Aww. I had the Archie Griffith theme song pop into my head.Joffrey being sent to bed.Ygritte shooting Jon in a manner that said \"I love you THIIIIIS much\"...repeatedly.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I loved this episode.\u00a0 It was a beautiful capstone the season.\u00a0 This episode went at a break neck pace.\u00a0 All the major characters were hit upon and significantly advanced.We saw the aftermath of the Red Wedding through the eyes of Arya.\u00a0 It's amazing how one episode can seem so far away and at least I had already come to grips that the House Stark.\u00a0 We see the famous scene of Robb's body with his direwolf's head.\u00a0\u00a0 We see Arya's blood lust continue to grow.\u00a0 The Bollton's plot line finally came together.\u00a0 I'd found this entire plot line too confusing in the season with the Roose and Ramsay and Theon plot line just mingling together.\u00a0 I hadn't picked up on the Boltons in season 2 and they've played such an important role in season 3 that it would have been nice to have them play a slightly larger role earlier before becoming the fulcrum on season 3.I love the plot in the North.\u00a0 Seeing Bran, Sam, and Jon come together was immensely rewarding.\u00a0 I love seeing Bran develop into a strong character.\u00a0 Sam is just plain awesome too.\u00a0 I love his platonic relationship with Gilly.Kings Landing was awesome.\u00a0 Seeing Jaime return with Brienne was really great.\u00a0 I'd missed Jaime over the past couple of episodes.\u00a0 I loved seeing the relationship between Tyrion and Sansa grow and the devastation that Tyrion feels when he sees that Sansa knows of her family's death.\u00a0 The scene in the Small Council was truly awesome.\u00a0 Tywin ruling the roost with Jofrey parading around like a school boy was delightful.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was left a little cold with Shae's scene.\u00a0 The scene with Daenarys, while necessary, was rather perfunctory in my mind. I'm getting a little tired of her making the same \"free the slaves\" speech and being adored.\u00a0 I sort of feel that this part has been floating out in space, without a close tie to the rest of the geography of world.\u00a0 I know there is a map, but I don't get the geography from the show.\u00a0 Just a short scene of her discussing the plan forward would be great.\u00a0\u00a0 Is she planning on marching all the way back to the Narrow Sea? Anyways, an awesome episode!", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Well, I'm not going into lengthy analyses, because other people are much better at that than me. But here are some little things I liked a lot.Oh my god, they showed THAT scene after all!After episode 9 some people were relieved that not all the gory details about the Red Wedding aftermath were shown. Turns out they were wrong...Sansa smilesIt's been a while since we've seen Sansa smiling and being charming. Her scene with Tyrion finally showed a bit of the lady she was brought up to be. Of course, since we can't have Sansa happy, she gets the bad news about her brother and mother within the next five minutes.Yara has a heartI never cared much for Yara's cynism, but in this episode we finally see her caring and even going against her father's wishes to rescue Theon. I'm really looking forward to see how that thread continues.Arya and the Hound share vengeanceOf course, Arya is awesome once again, but I like how she and Sandor Clegane are growing to understand each other better. They both know what the desire for vengeance feels like, and they're both not afraid to deliver sweet vengeance upon their foes.Joffrey gets sent to bedI always love it when Joffrey is kicked around, and there's no man who can do it better than Lord Tywin himself. \"The King is tired. See him to his chambers.\" :-)Jaime's homecomingJaime has been through a lot and finally makes it back to King's Landing. But here we see how much he has changed and how much things have changed for him. He's definitely not the cocky, arrogant bastard he was before, so I'm curious to see more of him in season 4.All in all: nice season ender. Looking forward to next season :).", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605What's not to like? It felt like they did a great job of ending the season showing us where every story and character is heading. Boy that was a lot to get done over an hour, and yet it didn't feel rushed. I really enjoyed that episode.I particularly enjoyed the intense scene with Arya. That storyline is going to be awesome!The small council meeting was also epic. They really gave us what we wanted, which was confrontation.All in all every scene in this episode felt like action -> stuff was happening, that mattered.I felt like this episode plus the prior two really vindicated this season. I'd give the season overall 3 1/2 or 4 stars.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605I would say this episode was so-so. It wasn't anywhere near as dramatic as The Rains of Castamere episode, but at least it wasn't abysmally slow.Some of the parts featured in this episode that I liked were:Tyrion standing up to Joffrey.Shae got some screen time, and they built up her character a bit as well.Cersei talking about how much joy Joffrey brought to her when he was a kid.These were all good buildup to some of the events to come.The closing sequence had a further glimpse of the dragons, which wasn't bad either.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I am writing this post just to see if somebody else noticed this. There was light and direwolf at the end of the tunnel. Some hope for the Starks? ", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I'm just glad that I finally learned why Simon/Barry from Misfits was going medieval on Greyjoy and saw Arya begin her revenge killing spree.

The two girls can leave. - ( snaps fingers ) - You stay. I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord. Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while. - My lord. - I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince? Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive. Take off your clothes. Which way do you like it? - ( gasps ) - My way. Man:  And so he spoke and so he spoke   That Lord of Castamere  -  And now the rains  - Oberyn. -  Weep o'er his hall  - Oberyn, don't.  With no one there to hear   Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall   And not a soul to hear.  You lost, friend? Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from. I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital. We don't like the smell. ( laughs ) - Come with me, lover. - Gods, look at this one. Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room. Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil. ( laughs ) Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister? You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw. ( screams ) Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist. ( groans ) He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions. Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. - We heard there might be - ( screams ) trouble. Apologies, my love. I'm here to welcome you to the capital. Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister. If there's anything I can do to make your stay-- What are you? His hired killer? It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight. How did that come to pass? Killed the right people, I suppose. ( laughs ) We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes? You don't partake? Oh, I partook. Now I'm married. Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private? Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake. - Oh, they take all kinds. - Even Dornishmen. The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding. Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all. Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult. ( chuckles ) Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn? I was invited to the royal wedding. I thought we were speaking truth. The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city I wasn't actually present. and butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her? I'm asking you a question. I've heard rumors. ( chuckles ) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened. If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts. ( dragons screeching ) ( growls ) ( screeching ) - ( growls ) - ( chuckles ) - ( screeches ) - Shh. ( screeching ) ( gasps ) Shh. Shh. - ( roars ) - ( gasps ) ( roars ) They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother. - Ser Barristan. - Your Grace. Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm? Gambling, Your Grace. Gambling? Crowd: Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa How long have they been at it? Since midnight, Your Grace. Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake. What's the prize to winning this stupid contest? The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen. That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock. The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for. ( Daario groans ) _ _ _ _ _ You need to eat something. Pigeon pie. No, thank you. Lemon cakes? No, thank you. You love lemon cakes. Tell her she needs to eat. My lady, you do need to eat. I don't need to eat. If I could have a moment alone with my wife. She needs to eat. I can't let you starve. I swore to protect you. My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you. How can you help me? I don't know, but I can try. I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died. I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep. Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river. What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true. Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood. Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear. I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me. My lion. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Come here. How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here. I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been? Of course I haven't forgotten. I want you. Don't you want me? Things are a bit tense right now. What things? My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister. You need to relax. Don't you want to relax? - What's wrong? - I told you. - It's not a good time. - It's never a good time. - You have your child bride now. - Shae. - Do you love her? - Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. - She despises me. - That's not an answer. Of course I don't love her. You tried to ship me away. Ship you away? Give me diamonds and make me disappear. What in the world are you talking about? If you want me to leave, just say it. - Say it! - Shh. I don't know what you're talking about. You want me to stay? ( groans ) A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent. You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it. Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right. - Days? Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel? Uh a hook would be more practical. Elegant, I think. Thank you for your help with the other matter. - The symptoms have abated? - Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn. Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can. Odd little man. - I've grown rather fond of him. - ( door closes ) He's quite talented, you know? What symptoms? Symptoms that are not your concern. You let him touch you? You jealous? I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you. ( laughs ) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat. I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat. Well, they smell like Pycelle. You drink more than you used to. - Yes. - Why? Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident. It must have been traumatic for you. My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege. A rather short siege. A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So Father disowned me today. He can't disown you. You're all he's got. You're forgetting Tyrion. You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you? Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you. - Not now. - I want-- Not now? When? I've been back for weeks. - Something's changed. - Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same? What do you want me to apologize for? For leaving me. You think I wanted to be taken prisoner? Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone. Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you. - You took too long. - I - What are you saying? - I'm saying you took too long. ( knocking ) - Come in. - Jaime: Go away. Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important. You plan on killing all the crows yourself? Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter? We wait for Mance's orders. You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back. And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there. Yeah, well, he's a liar. He is? Shouldn't it be \"he was\"? You said you put three arrows in him. I did. I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go. ( whistles ) Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns. Mance sent you? - ( grunts ) - How did you find us? You came from the south, not the north. Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way. Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall? Help yourself. ( chuckles ) Maybe everything's just better fed down here. Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm? You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too? I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you. She yours? I'm not anybody's. Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black. Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled. I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow. Officer: Draw. Loose. Jon: Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. He said, \"Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. ( winces ) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything-- fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could. Sometimes I want to hate you. Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading. They're-- they're ready for you. He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance. No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong. I've done plenty wrong. So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand? Jon: I didn't murder him. No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that? He wanted me to kill him. A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect? The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army. Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother. Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him Slynt: The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now. Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I-- I laid with a wildling girl. You admit to breaking your vows, then? I do. The law is the law. The boy must die. If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men. There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy. While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000. Impossible. You can't get before they start killing each other. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him. ( laughs ) Giants? Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser? I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy. And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job. How dare you?! There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth. Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go? None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on. I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon. Yes, you are. And I don't trust the bastard. He told the truth. And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power? I grew up in King's Landing. Olenna: No. No. You're a queen, not an ox. Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday. The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything. Nonsense. My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best. ( girls laughing ) The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that. Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck. You watch that. Even here, even with me. ( footsteps approaching ) My word. My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth. We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular. I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is. My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment. You dare not refuse. A shadow? A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king. Joffrey is our king now. I meant no offense. And you've given none. All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace? Yes, yes, one guard at the-- the thing. Go on. Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen. I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence. And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble. The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed. Margaery Tyrell, I've heard. By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war. The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives. I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle. My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy. Busy getting captured. So this is the famous \"Book of Brothers\"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. ( chuckles ) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. ( laughs ) Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man. So they say. Ser Jaime Lannister. ( chuckles ) Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds. - There's still time. - Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that? I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest. Daenerys: Have you ever been to Meereen? Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys. And? They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen. And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried? If they're smart, Your Grace. You were told to ride at the back of the train. Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy. Your Grace. All right, what is this matter of strategy? A dusk rose. Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding? And this one's called lady's lace. Would you like to walk without shoes? You have to know a land to rule it. Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy. Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous. You are a gambler, aren't you? Your Grace. ( man shouts in Valyrian ) There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen. How many miles are there between here and Meereen? Barristan: I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this. You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her. Brienne: There she is. Jaime: Yes, there she is. - And? - You made a promise. To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead. To keep them safe. Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication. A complication does not release you from a vow. What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here? Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing. Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks. ( footsteps ) ( footsteps stop ) ( gasps ) - ( gasps ) - It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. - You're drunk. - Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me? Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered. I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you. Anyone would have done the same. But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life. It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me. I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't. I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world. I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos. Yeah. ( flies buzzing ) Arya: When am I going to get a horse of my own? The little lady wants a pony. The little lady wants away from your stench. Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away? Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left? No. You're not very smart, are you? I'm not a thief. You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you? A man's got to have a code. You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one. You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much. Arya: I'm hungry. You're hungry. Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach. I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal. ( urinating ) He killed Lommy. What the fuck's a Lommy? He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it. Hound: Got what? My sword Needle. Needle? Of course you named your sword. Lots of people name their swords. Lots of cunts. What are you-- get back here. My brother gave me that sword. - Get back here. - He killed my friend. I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there. - ( man laughing ) - Man: Come on, give it up. ( woman whimpering ) - Come here. - ( whimpering ) - Let's have a feel there. - Leave it. - ( laughing ) - Come here. Please, she's a good girl. Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her. I know you. You're the Hound. Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north? I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here? Just keeping the king's peace. No need. The war's over. So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. - Meaning no offense. - None taken. He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun? ( chuckles ) But I don't need to tell you that, eh? She's all right. I've had better. ( laughs ) You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been. I'm not going to King's Landing. Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours. Fuck the king. ( chatter stops ) When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. - But here you are. - Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens. - You got money to pay for it? - You paid for it? ( laughs ) No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money? Not a penny. I'll still take that chicken. Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in. ( men chuckle ) You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty. Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens. You don't seem to understand the situation. I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room. You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens? Someone is. ( shouts ) ( whimpering ) ( grunting ) ( groans ) ( screams ) ( screaming ) ( gasping ) ( grunts ) ( groans ) ( screams ) ( groans ) Something wrong with your leg, boy? What? What do you mean? Can you walk? I've got to carry you? Carry me? Fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it. ( gasps ) ( gurgling )", "summary": ["Plot Tyrion welcomes a guest to King's Landing while at Castle Black, Jon Snow finds himself unwelcome. Dany is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya runs into an old friend.  Summary In King's Landing Ice reforged Ice is reforged.  Tywin Lannister has the ancestral Valyrian steel greatsword of House Stark, Ice (held by the Lannisters since Eddard Stark's execution) melted down and re-forged into two smaller swords. While he watches the process, he tosses the sword's wolf pelt scabbard on the smith's fire, smiling as he watches it burn. He presents one of the swords to his son Jaime as a gift. Jaime is impressed, as the Lannisters have not owned a Valyrian steel sword of their own for generations. Tywin tells him he acquired the original sword from \"someone who no longer needed it\" and then commissioned a Volantene blacksmith, the best of those who can work with Valyrian steel, to re-forge it. He wants Jaime to be his heir and return home to Casterly Rock, but Jaime insists on remaining in the Kingsguard. Furious at Jaime's disobedience and lack of ambition, Tywin rebuffs him. He tells Jaime to keep the sword anyway.   Tyrion Lannister, Bronn, and Podrick Payne wait on a road outside the city for the arrival of Prince Doran Martell of Dorne, who has been invited to the royal wedding. Tyrion quizzes Bronn on the sigils of the Dornish houses, none of which he knows, however Podrick answers perfectly. Lord Blackmont approaches them on horseback and says Prince Doran is in poor health and remained at Sunspear. Doran's brother, Prince Oberyn, will be attending the wedding in his stead, and arrived before dawn. Assigning the reception of the Dornish Lords to the City Watch, Tyrion says they should find Oberyn as soon as possible \"before he kills somebody or several somebodies\".  Oberyn Martell Prince Oberyn confronts the two Lannister soldiers.  Prince Oberyn and his bastard paramour Ellaria Sand are examining prostitutes in a brothel owned by Petyr Baelish, but currently managed by Olyvar, as Lord Baelish is now in the Vale. They choose the contortionist Marei, and Oberyn orders Olyvar to get undressed also. Oberyn is infuriated when he hears men singing \"The Rains of Castamere\". He confronts the two Lannister soldiers, who insult him and Ellaria. Oberyn moves closer and chastises them for being \"pink little men who are far too slow on the draw\" rather than being \"golden lions\". One of the soldiers reaches for his sword, and Oberyn quickly stabs him through the wrist with a dagger and tells the other that his friend will only live if he immediately gets help. Tyrion and Bronn enter, and Oberyn and Tyrion step outside to speak privately. Oberyn says he wants revenge for the murder of his niece Rhaenys, his nephew Aegon, and the rape and murder of his sister Elia during the sack of King's Landing by Lannister troops during Robert's Rebellion. He wants Gregor Clegane, who murdered Elia, and Tywin, who Oberyn believes gave the order for Elia and her children to be killed.  Tyrion, Sansa, Shae, and another handmaiden are sitting in a garden. Sansa is still distraught over the deaths of her brother and mother. Tyrion attempts to console his wife but fails; Sansa has heard the gruesome details of the Red Wedding, how the corpses of her mother and brother were desecrated. Sansa then leaves for the godswood, not to pray but because it is the only place no one talks to her. Tyrion returns and finds Shae in his bed. He scolds her because no one can find out about their relationship. She attempts to seduce him but he resists. She accuses him of trying to bribe her with diamonds and ship her away to the Free Cities, but he doesn't know what she's talking about (Varys did this acting alone). She angrily leaves the room but is spotted by the handmaiden Bernadette, who is hiding behind a pillar and has overheard their conversation.  Jaime, Cersei, and Qyburn are in Cersei's chambers. Cersei has had a golden prosthetic hand made for Jaime, and Qyburn attaches it to Jaime's stump. Qyburn asks Cersei about her symptoms, and she says they are gone. After Qyburn departs, Jaime tells her that he will stay in the Kingsguard with one hand so he can stay close to her, then tries to kiss her, but she turns away, much to Jaime's confusion and anger. Cersei implies that she has taken other lovers and that their relationship has changed because of his lengthy absence, a statement that clearly wounds Jaime. Bernadette suddenly enters and says she has important information for Cersei.  As preparations for the royal wedding continue, Margaery Tyrell and her grandmother Olenna are interrupted by Brienne of Tarth, (Olenna being delighted to see the truth of the rumors about Brienne) who requests a private word with Margaery. Brienne tells Margaery the truth of Renly's death and vows to one day exact revenge on Stannis Baratheon, whom she holds responsible. They walk past a statue of King Joffrey standing over a dead direwolf, commemorating the victory over the northern rebellion.  Elsewhere in the Red Keep, Jaime, Ser Meryn Trant and King Joffrey discuss security at the upcoming wedding. Jaime is clearly irked by Joffrey's arrogance as well as Meryn's sycophantic agreement with the king's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed (Jaime notes that this is more the doing of the Tyrells) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war. Jaime (who had previously noted to his father that thousands in King's Landing alone still want Joffrey dead) points out that the war is far from won; Stannis is still alive and will probably raise fresh armies. Dismissive of the threat posed by Stannis following the Battle of the Blackwater, Joffrey leafs through the Book of Brothers, which details the history of the Kingsguard and those who served in it. He reads Jaime's brief entry and sneers that someone must have forgotten to record all of his uncle's great deeds. He also questions Jaime's ability to serve in the Kingsguard with one hand. Jaime defensively quips that using his left hand makes for more of a challenge.  As Sansa prays alone in the godswood, she is watched by Jaime and Brienne; Brienne expects Jaime to uphold his oath to return Catelyn Stark's daughters in return for his freedom, but Jaime counters by pointing out the situation is complicated by Catelyn's death and Sansa's marriage to Tyrion. As Sansa is leaving the godswood, she is approached by Dontos Hollard, who thanks her for convincing Joffrey to spare his life and gives her what he claims to be his mother's necklace as a token of gratitude.  In the North Ygritte and Tormund stand outside a stone ravine. Tormund chides her for failing to finish off Jon Snow. Suddenly, their scouts signal that someone is approaching. Styr and a band of Thenn approach them through the ravine. Out of earshot, Tormund comments about how much he hates Thenns. Styr says his party raided a village south of the ravine and gathered meat. He says the meat tastes so much better south of the Wall, and chides Tormund for losing their warg as well as Jon. He reminds Tormund how the Night's Watch are feasting and getting fat at Castle Black. Styr suggests that Tormund taste crow meat before he dies, as a human arm roasts over a fire.  At Castle Black At Castle Black, Jon Snow has survived the injuries inflicted by Ygritte and has largely recovered, though he still grimaces while getting dressed and walks with a slight limp. Having been told of Robb's death, Jon shares with Samwell Tarly that he had always been jealous of Robb for having more of their father's affection and for being better than him at riding and fighting, and with girls. Despite all this, he says he could never bring himself to hate Robb. Sam responds by saying he has felt the same way about Jon, that Jon is better than him at everything apart from reading.   It turns out that Sam had been sent to retrieve Jon, who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers, including Maester Aemon, acting Lord Commander Alliser Thorne, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and the exiled former Lord Commander of the King's Landing City Watch, Janos Slynt. Both Thorne and Slynt are openly hostile to Jon, disbelieving much of what he says. At the hearing, Jon admits to killing Qhorin Halfhand but says that it was not murder, rather Qhorin wanted Jon to kill him to give Jon credibility with the wildlings in order to get a spy into Mance Rayder's army. Slynt dismisses Jon as \"the bastard son of a traitor\" while Thorne, a friend of Qhorin's, reacts with incredulity that Jon would presume to act like he knew the Halfhand. Jon responds by saying that Thorne should know that Qhorin would have done anything to protect the Night's Watch.  S04E1 - Jon Snow Jon testifies before a panel of five sworn brothers.  When Jon refers to the wildlings as \"Free Folk,\" Slynt accuses him of going native, to the extent he even talks like them. Jon snaps back, acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the wildlings, eating with them, and climbing the Wall with them. He catches himself before admitting that he lay with one, but says it anyway. Slynt calls for Jon's execution for breaking one of his vows. Aemon points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that \"the Wall would be manned by headless men.\" Thorne says that there is a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.  Jon does not defend himself at this point. Instead, he says that Mance Rayder intends to attack the Night's Watch with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence on Mance's plan of attack. Both Thorne and Slynt disbelieve what Jon has to say. Aemon, however, realizes that Jon is speaking the truth, and the hearing ends with Jon being allowed to keep his head, although after Jon leaves, Thorne expresses his distrust for Jon.  In the Riverlands Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane are still traveling through the Riverlands on a single horse. They pass by overturned carts and dead bodies, including those of children. Arya asks when she is going to get her own horse, complaining of the Hound's stench. He scoffs at the idea, noting that horses are hard to come by and that he wouldn't give Arya her own horse (even if one was available) as she is the only thing of value he has since he did not take anything of value when he left King's Landing. Arya assures him she has no plans to run off, saying that she would die by nightfall without him as she has no one to go to. The Hound reminds her that she still has an aunt in the Vale, Lysa Arryn, to whom he plans to ransom Arya to.  The two eventually come upon a tavern. Both hungry, Arya suggests that they attack the men there, to which the Hound expresses reluctance as there are five men. Just then, two men exit to relieve themselves. Arya recognizes one of them as Polliver, the Lannister man-at-arms who had previously taken Arya's sword Needle and killed her friend Lommy. She also notices that Polliver still has Needle and runs off to get it back. The Hound chases after her, stopping her at the tavern's door, but they are seen and choose to go in anyways.  Arya and Sandor - Two Swords Arya listens as the Hound and Polliver discuss.  It is clear that Polliver and the other men are making trouble and intend to rape the Innkeeper's daughter. Arya and the Hound go to a table far away from everyone else, but Polliver still recognizes the Hound and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation. He does not recognize Arya, who he thinks is just the Hound's latest sexual conquest. Polliver implies that he and his men intend to rape and pillage on their way back to King's Landing and invites the Hound to come along. Polliver says that he and his men wear the King's colors and can do whatever they like, to which the Hound leans forward and states emphatically, \"fuck the king.\"  The conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff. They eventually draw their swords. At first, the Hound fights the five men alone while Arya stands in the corner. He easily dispatches two of them and fights off the rest, stabbing one in the groin. Another, however, gets him on the ground, holding a dagger to his throat. The Hound is able to fight him off, stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger.  Arya then joins the fray, smashing a pot over the head of one of the men and stabbing him with his own long sword. She then slashes Polliver's leg from behind, causing him to fall to the ground. Arya takes Needle from Polliver and stands over his prone form. She echoes what he had said to Lommy just before he killed him, though Polliver still doesn't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about. Arya then repeats what he had said to her when he took Needle: \"Fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.\" It is at that point when Polliver recognizes her and becomes frightened. Arya then kills Polliver in the same way he had killed Lommy by driving Needle slowly into his throat. Arya and the Hound then leave the tavern, taking with them a horse for Arya and a chicken the Hound wanted.  In Slaver's Bay Daenerys Targaryen sits near the sea with her three dragons, each one about the size of a small horse. Daenerys strokes Drogon's head, while Rhaegal and Viserion fight over a dead lamb, Drogon joins the fight. As Daenerys tries to calm him down, without warning, Drogon snaps at her with a hiss, a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill.  Drogon snarls at his mom Drogon snarls a warning at his \"mother\".  This act, that her own children would threaten her, and that they are outgrowing her influence and ability to rein them, leaves Daenerys visibly shaken. Jorah Mormont approaches and tells her that dragons can never be tamed, not even by their mother.  Daenerys returns to her Unsullied army to resume the march to Meereen. She notices Grey Worm and Daario Naharis are absent and sets out to find them after being told they are \"gambling\". She finds the two men sitting face-to-face holding their weapons in front of them; they have been contesting their endurance since midnight. Daario explains they are deciding on which of them will ride up front with her in the vanguard. Frustrated, Daenerys states that the honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as they did not keep her waiting all morning. She orders the two men to ride at the back of the army with the livestock. Daenerys also adds that the last man holding his sword shall find a new queen to fight for and both men immediately drop their weapons.  On the road to Meereen, Daenerys speaks with Missandei, who tells her queen that Meereen would be wise to fear her approach. Daario meets them on the cliff side, and Daenerys expresses her annoyance when he shows her flowers he has picked. He reveals that the flowers represent a portrait of the landscape, and serve various purposes, chiefly that knowing her surroundings is important to Daenerys' strategy.  The marching army halts, and Daenerys goes to the forefront, discovering a slave child crucified upon a cross. The child is dead, her hand pointing the way to Meereen, and Ser Jorah tells Daenerys there is one for each mile to the last of the great slave cities, 163 in total. Ser Barristan offers to have outriders go ahead to bury them, but Daenerys refuses, ordering that each of them be buried, and their collars removed, but not before she has looked upon each and every face."], "review": null}, "31": {"id": "s04e02", "name": "The Lion and the Rose", "script": "Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! There you are. I can't see her, Ramsay. Tansy! If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run! - Tansy. - Where is she?  Tansy, Tansy, Tansy! Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too. - I only wounded her. - You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek? A fine shot, master. My lady. Please, my lord. It hurts. Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon. She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face. We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work. Why? I did whatever you asked. But you made Myranda feel jealous. - Me jealous of her? -  My lord, please. You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem. Rip her! Rip her! Rip her! Not so pretty now. Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod? Is it solid gold? Gilded steel. You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself. - I'm not hungry. - You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her. A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness. - Oh! - I'll clean it up. No, I'll do it. Leave us. It's only wine. I can't fight anymore. What about your left? I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass? You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword? I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand. With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone. You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one. My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword. He tells me you shit gold just like your father. Is this place safe? There's this knight, Leygood, - got thunderbolts on his shield. - Uh-huh. Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us. I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to. And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me. I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine. Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down. Best time to attack a man. Mind yourself. - If I still had my right hand - Plan on growing it back? Come on, then. Open the gates! Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to! Father. Welcome home. Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard. A pleasure, Mother. Hello. See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers. This way, my lady. Where is your prize? With the hounds. I'll have a look at him. I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer. Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it. Father. What did you do to him? I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned. You flayed him. Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others. This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir. We've been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years. The flayed man is on our banners. My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin. I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-- You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent? You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted. I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole. Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us. I placed far too much trust in you. Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? -  It's disrespectful. - I'm sorry, my lord. Give him the razor. If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter? Go on, Reek. A nice close shave. Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark? I don't know, my lord. You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.  Reek, did you murder the Stark boys? No, my lord. Just two farm boys. And crisped them so no one would know. Yes, my lord. The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone. Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that? - You ready for a hunt? - Always. Find those boys and I'll give you 1,000 acres and a holdfast. Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell? Jon Snow is at Castle Black. Who the fuck is Jon Snow? Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are. Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat. You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position. Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king? I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs. - Oh, to be foreign. - Ahem. Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears. So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie. No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear. Forgive me if I don't weep for you. No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her. She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it. Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat? From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup. May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long. A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father? I shall be honored, Your Grace. She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one. Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding. A book? \"The Lives of Four Kings.\" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read. Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle. One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor. Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel. So they say. Such a great sword should have a name. - What shall I call her? -  Stormbringer. - Terminus. - Widow's Wail. - Wolfsbane. - Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again. Don't. You want me on the desk? -  What's wrong, my lion? - Don't call me that. What should I call you? I'm afraid our friendship can't continue. Our friendship? There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos. What? You'll have your own cabin, of course, and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants. What is this? I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows. She doesn't want you. -  I need to do right by her. - You don't want her. By our children. - What are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid. You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. - You're going to run from them all your life? - I need you to leave. I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run. - Shae. - We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine. You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? How many whores have you been with? I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over. You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship. Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness. Sire, I served you well. Lord of Light, show us the way Selyse, you're my sister! Yours are the stars that guide us. Tell him! Tell him! Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors. Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see? Lord Florent was your brother by law. He was an infidel. He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too. I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed. How many ships did he bring to your cause? How many men? A good deal more than you. Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see? I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen. Meat's off. Our larders are almost empty. Serve fish, then. We're on an island. You hate fish. I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same. When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. - Do you remember? - Of course I remember. Have you ever known true hunger, my lady? It's all I knew when I was a child. Until you found the Lord of Light? Until he found me. I fear for our daughter's soul. Every mother should fear for her child's soul. - She's a stubborn little beast. - She's a child. You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod. She's my daughter. You will not strike her. As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her. Come in. Were you sleeping, Princess? Did you watch the ceremony on the beach? I heard it. And it frightened you? Ser Axel was my uncle. He was always kind to me. They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world. But they screamed. Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy. Afterward they aren't ash and bone. You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess. And you didn't have this. No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods? I read \"The Seven-Pointed Star.\" Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two-- a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war. There are no seven heavens and no seven hells? There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now.  Hodor. Why did you wake me? You've been gone for hours. I was hungry. We're all hungry. I was just eating. Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran. Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human. You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything. Hodor, take me to the tree. Look for me beneath the tree.  He saw us. North. I know where we have to go. Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder. With this kiss, I pledge my love. We have a new queen. Better her than you. - Bit much, wouldn't you say? - It feels proportionate. - Proportionate to what? - The expected extravagance. People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long. You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you. Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking. Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share. Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity? No, your heartfelt thank-you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. \"The Iron Bank will have its due.\" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts. I'm not worried about the Iron Bank. We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love. All taken care of. - You saw her board the ship? - Aye, she's on it. You saw the ship sail away? No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys. How do you know? Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow. There's someone following you? She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing. Hello. - Hello. - Not you. You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage. My lady. My lady. Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.  A coat of gold   Or a coat of red   A lion still has claws   And mine, my lord  Very good. Very good. Off you go. My love, why don't we make the announcement? Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words. We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city. You're an example to us all. Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry. Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful. As does yours. So, looking forward to your wedding? Yes, very much. Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect. They certainly are. Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her. And neither will you. Your Grace. My king. - My queen. - Lady Brienne. So good of you to come. I'm no lady, Your Grace. Did you just bow? Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy. You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon. That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it. A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life. I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful. - Yes, yes. - Thank you. I hope we see more of you. Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not. As you say, Your Grace. I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing. In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once. Did he? Haven't heard that story before. Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid. I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy. I don't serve your brother, Your Grace. But you love him. Your Grace. No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally. - She'll do no such thing. - Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice-- You should see Qyburn. He's quite good. - Your Grace. - Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments. More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs? Your Grace, I am a man of learning. My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me? I never meant to annoy anyone. But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels. Your Grace, Queen Margaery-- The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will. A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off. You're in rather a good mood. - I suppose I am. - I won't ask why. - Small pleasures. - Your Grace. Lord Tywin. Prince Oberyn. I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, - Ellaria Sand. - My lord. My lady. Charmed. Can't say I've ever met a Sand before. We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. No? How tolerant of you. I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked. I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding. Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again. They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it. Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne. People everywhere have their differences. In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place. Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords my ladies I give you King Joffrey Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings. I'm the rightful king. - King in the North! - Yes!  Traitor. You're a traitor. For the Seven Kingdoms! Let the war begin. Renly, you're no king. Away, degenerate. Away. Away. Ooh, careful. - Go on. - I want you to be my prince. Stannis! Who's got the gold now, Stark? I am the rightful king. Challenge me, ruffian. - Take that. - I'm drowning. I'm drowning. I am the King in the North! Not wildfire! Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done. Yes, my lord. We'll have to find another way to thank the king. Charge! Ready, again. I am the King in the North! - Charge! - Charge! Yes!  Your head! Fine gentlemen. Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume. One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled. It did not spill. My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast. Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight. Your Grace does me a great honor. It's not meant as an honor. Bring me my goblet. What good is an empty cup? Fill it. Kneel. Kneel before your king. Kneel. I said kneel! Look, the pie. My queen. Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero. - Can we leave now? - Let's find out. Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember? I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace. No, no, no.

Joffrey and Margaery host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis loses patience with Davos. Ramsay finds a purpose for his pet. North of the Wall, Bran sees where they must go.  Summary At Dragonstone On the beach of Dragonstone, Melisandre presides over a public burning ceremony, setting three people chained to stakes ablaze as an offering to the Lord of Light. One of the condemned is Queen Selyse Baratheon's own brother Axell Florent, executed for his lack of faith in the Lord's power. Watching the proceedings, Ser Davos Seaworth holds his tongue, though his disgust both for the ritual and Melisandre are plain. Melisandre is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings; it is Selyse who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual. Afterwards, Stannis and Selyse eat dinner, with Melisandre as a guest at their table. The royal couple argue over their daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon; Selyse believes the girl's disfigurement is a punishment from the Lord of Light, but Stannis angrily forbids his wife from trying to physically chastise their daughter for her perceived faults. Selyse switches tactics and suggests that Melisandre speak to Shireen. Stannis doesn't protest, but Melisandre doesn't look particularly interested in the task.  Melisandre talking to shireen Melisandre tells Shireen about death.  Nonetheless, Melisandre does speak with Shireen, who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window, explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the Faith of the Seven and its holy books are lies: Melisandre insists there are only two gods, the Lord of Light and the Great Other, constantly at war. When Shireen asks if there is any truth to the Faith's belief in seven heavens and seven hells, Melisandre replies \"There is only one hell... the one we live in now\".  At the Dreadfort Ramsay-and-Myranda-402-HD Ramsay and Myranda during their hunt of Tansy.  In the forests surrounding the Dreadfort, the seat of House Bolton, Ramsay Snow hunts a peasant girl for sport, accompanied by Theon Greyjoy (whom Ramsay now addresses by his new name, Reek) and Myranda, along with a pack of savage dogs. The girl is eventually brought down and torn to pieces by the dogs, much to Reek's horror.  Soon after, Roose Bolton arrives at the Dreadfort accompanied by a detachment of his army, including Locke and Roose's new wife, Walda Bolton. Ramsay greets his father and his new step-mother (as well as privately congratulating Locke for his maiming of the Kingslayer). Roose wants to see Ramsay's captive Theon Greyjoy.  Theon is brought to Roose's chambers, where Roose is disgusted and angered to learn Ramsay has tortured and flayed Theon; as Balon Greyjoy's sole surviving male heir, Theon was a valuable hostage. Roose notes that while he has been named Warden of the North, Tywin Lannister will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn, and he had intended on trading Theon for Moat Cailin, a strategically placed fortress on the border between the North and the Riverlands currently held by Greyjoy forces, preventing the main Bolton army from returning north. Ramsay retorts that he already sent terms and Balon refused him. Roose is furious that Ramsay did so without his consent, but Ramsay demonstrates that his actions have made Reek docile and unable to betray them.  After ordering Reek to shave him, Ramsay cajoles him into admitting that Bran and Rickon Stark are still alive. Ramsay reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to House Stark's rule of the North following Robb Stark's death, and nearly all the Northerners, who are furious at House Bolton and House Frey's treachery against the Starks, will rally behind Bran and Rickon rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive. Ramsay, knowing how close Theon was to Robb, gleefully taunts him by revealing details of the Red Wedding, particularly relishing the fact that it was Roose who personally murdered Robb. Despite being clearly shaken to know the man he considered a brother is dead at the hands of his new masters, Theon does not openly react.  Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone, while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well, given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat, since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge (although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms). Roose gives Ramsay orders as well; to take Theon and an army to Moat Cailin and reclaim the fortress from the Greyjoys. If he succeeds, Roose will give consideration to legitimizing Ramsay as a member of House Bolton.  Beyond the Wall We follow the point of view of a panting figure traveling through a dark, snow-covered forest. It kills a deer. Just as the figure makes its kill, it is revealed that the figure is Summer and that Bran Stark had been warging into Summer. Bran's warging is interrupted by Meera Reed, who says that Bran had been gone for hours. Bran is not happy about having been snapped out of his warging, saying that he was eating. Jojen Reed clarifies that Summer was eating and that what Bran cannot gain sustenance from what Summer eats. Jojen and Meera also caution Bran that warging so long is dangerous for other reasons. Even though it allows Bran the mobility he lost when he was injured, Bran would become trapped, forgetting his friends, his family, his home, and even himself. And if Bran forgets himself, they all lose everything.  S04E2 - Bran &amp; Hodor Bran about to skinchange with the Heart tree.  The group breaks camp and continues traveling through the forest. They eventually come upon a weirwood tree. Bran has Hodor take him to the tree. Bran touches the tree just under the face carved into it and sees a vision. Several images rush to Bran's mind, including swarms of crows, wights (both human and horses), and the fall that paralyzed him. He also sees the Three-Eyed Raven taking flight in a darkened corridor and later land on a tree. Bran sees his father sharpening Ice, in the Black Cells, and being led to his execution; the Red Keep abandoned and covered in snow; and the shadow of a dragon flying over King's Landing. Bran also sees several images of a different weirwood tree located on top of an otherwise barren mountain. During the vision, a gravely voice tells Bran to \"look for me beneath the tree... NORTH.\" Bran snaps out of his vision out of breath, but then matter-of-factly states, \"I know where we have to go.\"  At King's Landing Over a meal, Jaime and Tyrion discuss Jaime's gilded steel hand, and he discloses to Tyrion that he can no longer fight, as all of his instincts are wrong using his left hand. Jaime is perturbed that people will find out that he cannot fight so Tyrion tells him that he needs to train with his left hand with someone trustworthy in order to better protect the king, as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.  Later, Jaime waits in a courtyard by the sea for his training partner that Tyrion has arranged. Bronn emerges with two training swords. Jaime remarks that he hasn't wielded a sparring sword since he was nine. As they commence training, Bronn uses his usual dirty tactics and gets the better of Jaime, teaching him not only to use his offhand, but encouraging him to fight dirtier.  Tyrion finds Varys on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of Joffrey's wedding. Varys divulges that Shae has been spotted and that his sister, Cersei, has been notified. Varys then says that there is nothing he can do to protect Shae any longer in fear of Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King, or Cersei finding out that he has been lying to them. Tyrion then says that Shae will not leave King's Landing and is warned that Tywin has threatened to hang the next whore Tyrion is seen with.  At the breakfast celebration, Mace Tyrell gifts Joffrey a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets, one for each of the major houses in the Seven Kingdoms and wishes him and his daughter, Margaery Tyrell, a long and happy marriage. Joffrey graciously accepts. Cersei spots Shae and tells Tywin that she is Tyrion's whore, and he commands for her to be sent to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding. Tyrion overhears this and looks vexed, but proceeds to approach Joffrey and Podrick Payne, Tyrion's squire, presents him with the Lives of Four Kings, a book detailing the reigns of four kings by Grand Maester Kaeth. Joffrey accepts the gift, but his sincerity seems questionable. A member of the Kingsguard then presents a Valyrian steel sword and Tywin tells him that it is one of two swords of its kind in the capital, and Joffrey rushes to wield it. He promptly begins to slash at Tyrion's gift despite its rarity, and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance. He settles on the name Widow's Wail.  After the breakfast, Tyrion is visited in his chambers by Shae and he informs her that there is a ship waiting for her bound for Pentos and that their \"friendship\" is at an end. Realizing that Shae will defiantly refuse to flee in the face of danger, he concludes the only way to convince her to leave King\u2019s Landing and save herself is to brutally reject her. So he tells her, at enormous pain to himself as well as to her, that she is only a whore and he cannot love her. When Bronn enters and tries to escort her away, she slaps him and runs out, furious and broken-hearted. When Tyrion later asks Bronn if she is gone, he confirms that she boarded the ship. When Tyrion asks if he saw it sail away, Bronn assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her, that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and Varys. He then advises Tyrion to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing.  TheLionAndTheRose The dais set up for the royal wedding.  Brienne at joffrey wedding Brienne presented before King Joffrey and Queen Margaery at their wedding.  Joffrey and Margaery's wedding ceremony takes place in the Great Sept of Baelor conducted by the High Septon and they are wed in front of gods and men. At his wedding feast, King Joffrey speaks to the crowd about contemplating history. Out of a large golden lion, five dwarves ride out, representing Joffrey, Renly Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon, Robb Stark, and Balon Greyjoy, each of the five kings in the War of the Five Kings. The dwarves put on a performance, jousting, fighting, and making crude sexual acts. Joffrey, his brother Tommen, and Cersei laugh at the performance. The Tyrells (Margaery, Olenna, Mace, and Loras), as well as Varys, Prince Oberyn, Tyrion and Sansa Stark, make little effort to hide their disgust. Loras leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover Renly (riding a mount resembling Loras), and Sansa looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother Robb is killed after having his wolf's head knocked off. Joffrey expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the champion dwarf a purse but then mockingly suggests that Tyrion fight him as well. Tyrion cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that Joffrey should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the Battle of the Blackwater, cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is \"clearly mad with lust\" and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. This draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests. Enraged and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his wedding guests, Joffrey petulantly pours wine over Tyrion's head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer.  Tyrion approaches Joffrey, who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table. Sansa hands the goblet to Tyrion, and he fills it with wine and hands it back to Joffrey. The king demands that Tyrion kneel before him but Tyrion refuses. Margaery interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the pigeon pie. Joffrey hands the goblet to Margaery, who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother Olenna. Joffrey draws his new sword, cuts the pie, and several white doves fly out. Sansa and Tyrion attempt to leave the feast, while Margaery serves Joffrey a piece of pie. Joffrey commands Tyrion to serve him wine to wash down the pie. Tyrion hands the goblet to Joffrey and he quickly drinks all of it. Joffrey tries to speak, but begins coughing. He grabs his throat, and Margaery and Olenna exclaim that he is choking and needs help.  Purple Wedding Joffrey is poisoned and killed.  Joffrey collapses face down and begins vomiting and convulsing. Jaime and Cersei rush in and turn Joffrey over on his back. Dontos Hollard suddenly approaches Sansa from behind and says she must come with him quickly, and she does. Joffrey points an accusatory finger in Tyrion's direction, as he examines the wine goblet (though it is not made clear if Joffrey is accusing Tyrion or merely the wine). Joffrey's eyes turn red, blood runs from his nose, he stops convulsing, and dies. Cersei sobs with grief and orders the Kingsguard to seize Tyrion for the poisoning of her son.

Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor. - Where is she?! - No one leaves the capital! No one! - Get in. - Where are we going? Somewhere safe. Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know. - Lord Baelish? - Petyr. Are you hurt, my lady? Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. - The worst is past. - Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely. Softly, my friend. Voices carry over water. I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. First you'll want your pay. - 10,000 was it? - 10,000. Wait! Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king? - I didn't murder anyone. - I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder. Why did you kill him? Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools. He saved me. Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever. He was helping me because I saved his life. Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard. I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital? We're all liars here. Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home. So am I the queen? More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue. Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make it stop-- it was horrible. The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it. What was it like? They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was lying on a table. One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast. - I must be cursed. - Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that. But I would have been the queen. Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier. Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means? I'm not trying to trick you. It means I'll become king. Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be? A good king? Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality? This is hardly the place or the time. Holiness? Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful. Justice. Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize? - No. - No. - What about strength? - Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack? - Wisdom. - Yes! Wisdom is what makes a good king. Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers? - No. - No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards. Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why? A king needs a queen. Yes, but why? To further the family line. - Do you know how that happens? - Yes. Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you? I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward. - How are you? - I'm all right. You are. You will be. I'll see to that. Please give the queen a moment alone with her son. - Yes, my lord. - All of you. It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. \"A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.\" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he-- I don't know what I saw. Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion. Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened. I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy. You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman? Jaime, not here, please. Please. Stop it. - Stop it. Stop. - No. Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. It's not right. It's not right. It's not right. I don't care. - Don't. - I don't care. - Don't. Jaime, don't. - I don't care. Gonna rain soon. Where are we? Near Fairmarket, I think. You think? You don't have a map? - No, I don't have a map. - Maybe we should get one. Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one. How far is it to the Eyrie? Far. And you're sure we're going the right way? Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way. - On your way where? - Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me. I'd like to see Braavos one day. Why Braavos? I have friends there. I doubt it. Seven blessings to you. What do you want? What do I want? This is my land. If I'm standing on it, it's my land. We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it. He's never been the same. Which house did he fight for? The Tullys of Riverrun. There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it. We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity. You got to do all seven of the fuckers? Father! We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness. And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all. I'm so sorry. Really good. - Did you fight at the Twins? - Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like. The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right. Guest right don't mean much anymore. It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour. You got any ale? Afraid not. How can a man not keep ale in his home? You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense. What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work? Fair wages for fair work. - What did you do?! - Get your horse saddled. - You told me you weren't a thief. - I wasn't. He took us in. He fed us and you-- Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter. - You don't know that. - I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver. You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms. There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out? Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper. There he is, Sam the Slayer. Going to visit your wildling whore? - She's not a whore. - No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out. They all think I'm lying. About what? Killing the white walker. You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed. But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a-- A what? Well, a wildling. My father hated that word. It's not a very nice word, I suppose. I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it? So are you all right? No one bothering you? I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean. I worry about it sometimes. All the time. Why do you worry about it? They've got other things to think about. That's the only thing they think about. - You're being silly. - I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you. What about you? What about me? Gilly? I worry about you. Thank you. For what? For worrying about me. I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep. So what are you saying? Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town. Are you bored of me? Bored of you? I I want to protect you. I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam. Your Grace. You're a literary man now. What do you make of that? - Joffrey? - The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it. I will find you an army, Your Grace. - I've been working day and night-- - What progress have you made? I've rallied House Peasebury to your cause. House Peasebury. - House Musgood. - House Musgood. - And House Haigh. - House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry. Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. fight for the Golden Company. - The Golden Company? - They've never broken a contract. They're sellswords. We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground. We don't have any gold. Not yet. If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. You're late. I'm sorry, Princess. I thought you weren't coming. The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time. You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say \"ka-nigit.\" That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you. It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage. You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it. \"The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas First Sword of Braavos.\" Thank you very much. I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once. No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler. What's the difference? Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right. My father says a criminal is a criminal. Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi. - You've sailed to Braavos? - Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction-- - What was that for? - I need you to write a message. You should write it yourself. It's good practice. It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on. To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros. But that's not you. I need to get their attention. Go on. Write. He's seen some adventures, hasn't he? - Precious little thing. - Thank you. - What's his name? - Sam. Lovely. That the daddy? No. Where's the daddy? He's dead. Oh. Where you from? North of here. North of here? You a fucking wildling? - Only room and board? - That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies. Could find other work for her, too. - No other work. - There'd be money. Give you a piece of it. No other work. I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me? You protected me north of the Wall. This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's. You have to trust me. It's for the best. Best for you. Oh, Gilly. Please don't. Greedy. No? I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste. You're calling my beauty an acquired taste? That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you. Your loss. You like them both the same? - Boys and girls? - Does that surprise you? Everyone has a preference. Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides. I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age. What are you, 25? Children. Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day. Did you? He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies. They will all have to line up behind you. - Prince Oberyn. - Lord Tywin. May we have the room? Call my name if you need me, lover. Would you like to sit? No, thank you. Some wine? No, thank you. - I'm sorry about your grandson. - Are you? I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die. Which way is that? Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin? Some believe the king choked. Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned. I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel. I did. This is why I know. Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning. Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon? You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss? You think we conspired together? What did you discuss? The death of my sister. For which you blame me. She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you. Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned? You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow. Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge. So you deny involvement in Elia's murder? Categorically. I would like to speak with the Mountain. I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you. He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would. I could arrange for this meeting. But you want something in return. There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third. Why? Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies. Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting. I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors. I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin. We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons. You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit. We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's. Podrick. Apologies for the stench. I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me. A noble effort. They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese. You're a good lad. Any word of Shae? I've heard nothing, my lord. I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there? You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king. Do you believe I murdered Joffrey? No, my lord. You didn't? No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet? - Your father. - Of course. Mace Tyrell. Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote. And Prince Oberyn of Dorne. Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy. I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf. Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa. My lord, she's gone. Gone? No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. - Podrick. - Yes, my lord? - They'll be following you now. - Who will? I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go. Any other witnesses, my lord? Varys could vouch for me if he dared. He's already been called as a witness for the queen. Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him. I've already asked, my lord. - They won't let him see you. - Why not? They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself. And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime? I'll ask, my lord. There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler. Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him? I didn't tell them anything, my lord. Are you going to accept their offer? My lord. Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet. You've been good to me, my lord. Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that. I already gave them an answer, my lord. I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted. - My lord. - Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell. Farewell, my lord. Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire. Mother says it's time to eat. What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess. - Potatoes. - Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got-- The wildlings! Guymon! Hide. Hide! You know how to get to Castle Black? Yes. Yes. Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black. We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind. Aye! Aye! Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson. Aye! If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time. We have just over And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall. There's got to be a way to protect them. You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition? Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 miles before they reach an army that can stop them. We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job. Rangers returning. Help him. Thought you'd have blue eyes by now. What took you so long? - We were held up. - By what? Chains. We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep. - And the mutineers stayed? - They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth. We need to ride north and kill them all. We just went over this, boy. - Justice can wait. - It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them. I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings. Are they attacking? A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him. What is he doing? I believe he means to He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who hides his cock in his own asshole. Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words. They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them. I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion? Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive. Which is why you must remain by my side. I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well. You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life. I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you. Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while. He is very brave, Your Grace. Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching. You sure you don't want a horse? Why would I want a horse? Horses are faster than men. Horses are dumber than men.", "summary": ["Plot Tyrion ponders his options. Tywin extends an olive branch. Sam realizes Castle Black isn't safe, and Jon proposes a bold plan. The Hound teaches Arya the way things are. Dany chooses her champion.  Summary At King's Landing Tommen-and-Cersei Joffrey's body is displayed at the Great Sept of Baelor.  With King Joffrey dead, Cersei mourns the death of her elder son with the heir apparent and, still holding Joffrey in her arms, demands that Sansa Stark be found. Her father seals the capital, so no one can leave. Prince Tommen Baratheon, pays his respects to his dead brother in the Great Sept of Baelor. Tywin Lannister, also present, immediately begins instructing the young prince on the qualities of a good king. As Tywin and Tommen leave, Jaime enters to see Cersei calling for the death of the accused Tyrion and his wife, Sansa Stark. Jaime sends the septon and septas away so he can be alone with Cersei. He tries to comfort her through his affections. She refuses initially, but Jaime is aggressive. Cersei insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex, and asks Jaime to stop, saying \"It isn't right, it isn't right...\" and Jaime refuses to stop, saying, \"I don't care, I don't care...\". They then have sex next to their dead son's corpse.  A flashback to the wedding reveals Sansa escaping with Ser Dontos Hollard from King's Landing to a ship off the coast. As Sansa is taken aboard, she is greeted by Lord Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish. He remembers that he still owes Dontos his fee, but Baelish has two men kill him with crossbows. He explains to Sansa that Ser Dontos was a drunken fool and an unreliable ally who only helped Sansa for money and would turn her in for money. To prove his point, he shows that the priceless necklace Dontos gave her was actually made a few weeks ago on Baelish's orders. Sansa is confused and horrified, but Baelish promises to keep her safe.  Tywin interrupts Oberyn Martell and his group sex act with Ellaria Sand and Olyvar to discuss Tyrion's up-coming trial for the murder of Joffrey. Tywin brings up Oberyn's knowledge of poisons and the link between that and Joffrey's death \u2013 as some say the King was poisoned \u2013 and wonders whether Oberyn had helped Tyrion. The topic changes to the murder of Oberyn's sister Elia by Tywin's \"pet,\" the Mountain, during the Sack of King's Landing. Tywin denies ordering her death, but promises to arrange a meeting between Oberyn and the Mountain so he can have his justice. He also offers Oberyn a position on the Small Council, if Oberyn agrees to be the third judge at Tyrion's trial. He explains that he is eager to bring Dorne back into the fold, wanting to unite the Seven Kingdoms against more obvious threats; the Greyjoys are in rebellion, a Wildling army is advancing on the Wall, and there is a Targaryen girl in the East with a powerful army and three dragons, who will eventually threaten Westeros. Tywin observes that only the Dornish successfully resisted Aegon Targaryen's dragons during his invasion of Westeros three centuries ago; Oberyn dryly notes it must be hard for Tywin to admit he needs the Dornish for help.  Podrick visits tyrion in his cell Podrick visits Tyrion in his cell.  Tyrion is in a cell in King's Landing. He is visited by his squire, Podrick Payne, who has smuggled in some food and other items for him. Pod has been asked to compile a list of Tyrion's witnesses. He names his wife, Sansa, but Pod informs him that she disappeared moments after Joffrey's death. He cannot speak to Bronn either because, as a close associate of Tyrion, he is also under investigation. Pod confirms that there has been no word of Shae, which Tyrion takes as good news. Tyrion then asks to speak with Jaime. He also warns Pod to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for \"They,\" \"They\" being the spies of Tywin, Cersei, Varys or more or less anyone else. He opines that many people had a motive for killing Joffrey. Cersei is the only person he rules out. He urges Pod to get out of King's Landing as he would be in much danger due to his close relations with Tyrion, especially after refusing to testify against Tyrion, despite the offer of a knighthood. As Pod is about to leave, Tyrion calls him back and tells him that \"there has never lived a more loyal squire.\"  In the Riverlands Arya and Sandor - Breaker of Chains The Hound and Arya eating inside the farmer's house.  Meanwhile, Arya Stark and the Hound, crossing the Riverlands, are spotted by a farmer and his young daughter while making their way to the Vale where Arya can be ransomed to her \"rich\" aunt, Lysa Tully. Arya quickly fabricates a story that the Hound and she are father and daughter, with Clegane as a knight in service of House Tully. The farmer believes it and allows the pair to stay the night in his home and share a meal. Famished, Arya and the Hound scarf the food down hastily. Arya wakes the following morning to hear the farmer's daughter screaming. Clegane has assaulted the farmer and taken his silver. Confused and horrified, Arya demands to know why Clegane did that. He simply states, \"a dead man doesn't need his silver,\" claiming the farmer is weak and he and his daughter will not survive the upcoming winter.  At Dragonstone On Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon learns of Joffrey's death and warns Ser Davos that their time to lay claim to the Iron throne dwindles if no army can be secured to wage war again. Shortly after, when Ser Davos begins his reading lessons with princess Shireen Baratheon, he realizes a possible ally across the Narrow Sea, the Iron Bank of Braavos.   At the Wall and the North Grenn and Eddison - Breaker of Chains Grenn and Eddison arrives at Castle Black after a successful escape from Craster's Keep.  At Castle Black, Samwell Tarly fears for the safety of Gilly and moves her to a vassal town that frequently services the Nights Watch brothers in bodily vices. Sam is resolute in keeping Gilly safe from all harm however and pledges to visit Gilly as much as possible, instructing the inn at which he leaves her, that she will not be touched. Meanwhile, a village south of the wall is attacked by raiding wildlings under Tormund and the cannibalistic Thenns. While the village is massacred, a lone boy is sent by the Styr as a messenger to Castle Black to relay an account of the massacre and also a warning that more would follow. The Lord Commander states that they do not have the manpower to afford venturing away from the Wall. They are interrupted when two rangers, Edd and Grenn, arrive back at Castle Black after escaping Craster's Keep. Jon reveals he told Mance Rayder that a thousand men armed Castle Black and therefore points out that when Mance reaches Craster's Keep, Rast and Karl will not hesitate in revealing the truth. Jon then insists the Night's Watch send a party to Craster's Keep to kill their traitor brothers before Mance gets to them first.  Outside Meereen Dany and Huisman-Daario Daario Naharis offers himself as Dany's champion.  In Slaver's Bay, Daenerys Targaryen marches on the city of Meereen as she begins her siege of the slave city. She is faced with a champion's duel where a riding knight of Meereen challenges her to choose a champion that will fight for her. Grey Worm, Jorah and Barristan all volunteer to stand as her champion; she refuses all three as too valuable to her. Daario Naharis, commander of the Second Sons, then volunteers to be Dany's champion, and she accepts. As Naharis quickly dispatches the Meereen champion by killing the champion's horse, Dany begins her siege of the city by speaking of freedom to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls, demonstrating her previous successes. As the slaves examine the broken chains, the Great Masters look on, perhaps in fear."], "review": null}, "33": {"id": "s04e04", "name": "Oathkeeper", "script": "My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer \"Ills.\" Isles. Summer Isles. Summer Isles. I am from an island called Naath. When they took you? \"When did they take me?\" I was five years old. You remember your home? I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home? Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing. That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles. I don't want return. Kill the masters. Kill the masters. How are the lessons coming? Very well, Your Grace. Missandei is teacher good, my queen. You'll have to continue later. It's time. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts? Yes, that was it. Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people, they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy. I will answer injustice with justice. What the hell was that? That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand. You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway. You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win? You talk to my brother this way? All the time. He got used to it. Do you think he did it? No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him? You haven't been to see him yet, eh? We're done for today. Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service? You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie. Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now? To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. It's complicated, yes. - So how is our sister? - How do you think? Her son died in her arms. Her son? Don't. You know what's coming? My trial for regicide. Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed. Now that you mention it, she did ask. So, should I turn around and close my eyes? Depends. Did you do it? The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son? Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you? Well, you could set me free. You know I can't. Then there's really nothing else to say. What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate. Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king. Freeing you is treason. Except I didn't do it. Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike. Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark. Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died? No, but Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway. Where are you taking me? I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there. Did you kill Joffrey? Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks. I know it was you. And who helped me with this conspiracy? Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king. - Why not? - Because you're too smart to trust a drunk. Then perhaps it was your husband. No. How do you know? I just do. You're right. He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast. The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal. A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next. I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them? So many men, they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want. And what do you want? Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that? Who could trust you? I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong. I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people. The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs. Have you been to see Tommen yet? No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything. I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber. - How absentminded of me. - Mm-hmm. The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk. And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit. Well, he could have done. He could have done, but he didn't. - You don't know, Grandmother. - But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you? What? I don't understand. Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done. Bring it through! And again. Very nice. Good. A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds. Let's see what you can do. Olly, you just watch for now. I can fight. Have you ever held a sword before? I was the best archer in our hamlet. I was! I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn. You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other. You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him. He wouldn't have learned anything that way. Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing? Grenn and I were helping them. Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't. Someone has to train them. And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not here to protect you now. Get back to work. Now! I said now! The bastard's well-liked. You're not. You think I care if they like me? We're at war. For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to march on Craster's. Let the mutineers take care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life. A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn. My father was highborn. My mother wasn't. Name's Locke. Jon Snow. You fight well. What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here. Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer? Guess I was wrong. You sent for me, Your Grace? Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door? Ser Boros is on duty tonight. - Tomorrow I believe-- -  So one? You have one man guarding the future king? I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him. The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free? - What? - I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free? You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her. She hoped or did you promise? I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her. So you made a sacred vow to the enemy. I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told her to fuck off? You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark? Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it? I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son. I had to see him. I had to know for myself. And? He didn't do it, Cersei. You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander. Ser Pounce? How did you get past the Kingsguard? Kingsguard. I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night. I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has it I'm to be your bride. Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think? Yes. But if my mother found out-- It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace Yes? Tell me a secret. Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow? That's Ser Pounce. Very handsome. Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him. That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel. No. I don't think I am. That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry? We say our vows in front of the high septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast. When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then. Remember, our little secret. \"Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer.\" It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine. Valyrian steel. Mmm. It's yours. I can't accept this. It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you. I hope I got your measurements right. I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you. I almost forgot. I have one more gift. I don't need a squire. Of course you do. He'll slow me down. My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry. I won't slow you down, ser-- my lady. I promise I'll serve you well. See? He's a good lad. You'll get along. Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater. What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse. They say the best swords have names. Any ideas? Oathkeeper. Good-bye, Brienne. Come on, move. I should never have taken her away. - She wasn't safe here. - She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next. - Castle Black could be next. - I should go back for Gilly. We have orders. No one's to leave the castle. I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb. And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him. I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did. How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton? I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them. The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except Craster's? You think Bran might have found-- Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you. Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only. Thank you, Ser Alliser. Ahem, brothers. I'm going beyond the Wall to Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me? I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall. Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how. Thank you, brothers. No, don't. Don't, please. Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me. Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont. Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?  Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead. Rast. Go outside and feed the beast. We should kill that thing. You should shut your fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look like a fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutter and soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me. Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh? Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt? I wouldn't stand a chance. None of us would. I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight-- any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards. - A gift for the gods. - A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods. What the fuck is that? Craster's last child. A boy. What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right. Don't need another mouth to feed. - Hand him over. - He didn't kill them. - He offered them. - To who? To the gods. The white walkers. A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods. Shut up! So if it worked for him Let's give the walkers what they want. Rast is headed that way. Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty? Fuck! Hodor. Do you hear that? Is that a baby? It's coming. I'm going out there. No, we need to stay together. I'm going. - Bran. Bran. - Hodor. Hodor. - Hodor. - Bran, what happened? Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap. Who? I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost. They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here. If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage? They might have been Night's Watch once, not anymore. We're not safe here. We need to go. No. Bran, we need to go now. I'm not leaving without Summer. Can you remember where the cage was? The east side of the keep. If I'm not back soon, we'll meet-- Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world. Help him up. This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you? You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd? I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here? See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed. - What the fuck's wrong with him? - Come here. No, please. Please. Please, let me help him. - Who are you? - Please. - Who are you? - I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell. It's Jon Snow's brother. It's Meera. It's Meera. I'm right here. And I thought this was gonna be another boring day. I'm right here.", "summary": ["History Season 4 6de15b65107d9de914ca800c1ec637ba Oathkeeper's hilt.  Tywin gives the sword to his son Jaime, intending for him to be released from his vows as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and rule over Casterly Rock in his stead. Although Jaime refuses, Tywin lets him keep the sword anyway and tells him that a one-handed man without family (implying Jaime has been disowned) needs all the help possible.[1]  Following King Joffrey's death, Jaime tasks Brienne with finding Sansa Stark and get her somewhere safe before Cersei locates her. As a parting gift, he gives her the sword (and a new set of armor), as he knows it was reforged from Ice, so she can protect Ned Stark's daughter with Ned's own blade. Brienne  chooses the name \"Oathkeeper\" for her new sword.[2]  When Brienne and Podrick encounter Arya Stark and the Hound, Oathkeeper's obvious Lannister qualities (the hilt is a golden lion with ruby eyes) prompt Arya and Sandor to be suspicious of Brienne. When the situation turns hostile, Brienne uses Oathkeeper in combat for the first time against the Hound. However, she wins the duel by knocking the Hound off a cliff after brutal hand-to-hand combat.[3]  Season 5 Still in the Vale, Oathkeeper remains in Brienne's possession.[4] She and Podrick encounter Sansa Stark and Petyr Baelish at an inn, and Brienne tries to pledge her service to Sansa. Littlefinger, however, is successful at causing Sansa to doubt Brienne, and she dismisses her. When Baelish suggests Brienne spend the night at the inn, she recognizes the trap and fights her way out with Podrick right behind her. Brienne releases all the horses and kills three of the guards that attempt to pursue them with Oathkeeper. The Valyrian steel sword is strong enough to slice through the sword of one of the guards.[5] Brienne later uses Oathkeeper to execute Stannis Baratheon when she finds him after the Battle of Winterfell.[6]  Season 6 Brienne and Podrick arrive at the Wolfswood in time to rescue Theon Greyjoy and Sansa Stark from the Bolton soldiers sent by Ramsay Bolton after they escaped from Winterfell. Brienne uses Oathkeeper to slay several soldiers while Podrick and Theon dispatch the rest. After the battle, Brienne lays Oathkeeper at Sansa's feet and pledges fealty to her. This time, Sansa accepts Brienne's service.[7]  Sansa, Brienne, and Podrick arrive at Castle Black to finally meet up with Jon Snow. When Brienne notices the way Tormund Giantsbane is looking at her, she grabs the hilt of Oathkeeper nervously.[8]  Brienne later accompanies Sansa to the ruins of Mole's Town to meet with Petyr Baelish, who is delighted to see Sansa again, but less so to see Brienne. Sansa confronts Baelish with his treatment of her by giving her in marriage to Ramsay Bolton, and when he fails to answer when she asks him \"Do you know what he did to me?\", Brienne takes hold of Oathkeeper's hilt and calmly says, \"Lady Sansa asked you a question,\" prompting Littlefinger to reply. When Sansa asks why she shouldn't have Brienne strike him down, Brienne seems to be in agreement, even when Baelish tells Sansa that her mother's family has retaken their ancestral home of Riverrun from the Freys, and could possibly help her retake Winterfell from the Boltons.[9]  At Sansa's request, Brienne and Podrick travel to Riverrun, which Sansa's great-uncle the Blackfish has recently retaken, to persuade him to join Sansa and Jon in their quest to retake Winterfell for the Starks. They find Jaime Lannister and his army encamped around the castle, and Brienne meets with him to bargain for a meeting with the Blackfish, in hopes she can convince him to leave Riverrun peacefully to aid Sansa in the North. She offers Oathkeeper back to Jaime, saying it was given to her for a purpose (to get Sansa to safety), and now that the purpose has been achieved, it should go back to him. Jaime replies: \"It's yours. It will always be yours.\"  The Blackfish refuses to read Sansa's letter and accuses Brienne of being in league with Jaime Lannister, noting her \"sword with the gold lion on the pommel\". Brienne counters that Jaime gave her the sword so she might fulfill the vow he made to Catelyn to get her daughters to safety.[10]  Season 7 Brienne and Podrick make it back to Winterfell safely. There, Brienne continues to train Podrick in swordplay with a training sword, keeping Oathkeeper safely stored for real battle.[11]  Sansa sends Brienne and Podrick to King's Landing in her place to meet with Queen Cersei Lannister, King in the North Jon Snow, and Queen Daenerys Targaryen at the armistice meeting in the Dragonpit. As she discusses Arya with Sandor Clegane, Oathkeeper can be seen at her side. She stands on Jon Snow's platform, and exchanges uneasy glances with Jaime Lannister as he walks by with Cersei's entourage; she is also careful to keep Oathkeeper hidden under her cape to avoid Cersei's notice.[12]   In the books In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the sword is forged by Tobho Mott along with Widow's Wail. The sword has black and red ripples through the steel. Its scabbard glitters gold and is decorated with a row of lion's heads and smoldering red rubies. The pommel has a golden lion's head with ruby eyes that shine like two red stars.  Jaime is angry when the sword is given to him, thinking that it is a cruel joke of his father and uncle given that such a blade would be wasted on him, since he has lost his right hand (akin to giving expensive boots to a legless man). Kevan is upset to hear how Jaime feels about the sword, saying the gift was heartfelt, but Jaime is not mollified.  After returning to King's Landing, a short time after the Purple Wedding, Jaime and Brienne are stopped by Ser Loras Tyrell, who believes that Brienne was responsible for Renly's death. Jaime orders Brienne to be locked up for her own protection, thus when Jaime gives her sword she is in a tower cell, not the White Sword Tower. He also suggests the name \"Oathkeeper\" to her, claiming it is appropriate that she will be defending Ned Stark's daughter with Ned Stark's own steel.  While Brienne and Pod are in the Riverlands, searching for Sansa, Oathkeeper proves to be very useful at two bloody encounters between them and the Brave Companions.  Brienne, Pod and their companion Ser Hyle Hunt are taken captive by the Brotherhood Without Banners, which has fallen low ever since the monstrous Lady Stoneheart replaced Beric Dondarrion as its leader. They are accused and sentenced to death on the charge of serving the Lannisters; unfortunately, the fact that Brienne carries Oathkeeper strengthens the false accusations.  Lady Stoneheart calls the sword \"Oathbreaker\" and \"False Friend\", stating it was made for treachery and murder. She demands that Brienne take up the sword to keep her oath to Catelyn Stark and slay Jaime. Brienne explains that Jaime is not the man he was; he saved her life; he sent her after Sansa to keep her safe; and he could not have had a part in the Red Wedding. Brienne's words, however, fall on deaf ears. Lady Stoneheart orders to hang her and her companions. When Brienne is being hanged and sees her companions dying, she reluctantly screams \"sword\"."], "review": null}, "34": {"id": "s04e05", "name": "First of His Name", "script": "May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times.

In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign! Long may he reign! Special day. Your Grace. Your Grace. - Your Grace. - Your Grace. Your Grace. There he is. Long may he reign. Long may he reign. He sits the throne like he was born to it. Yes. He wasn't, though, was he? No, he wasn't. You still mourn for Joffrey? He was my husband. My king. He would have been your nightmare. Your Grace, I feel-- You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked? No. The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it. It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there. He will need help if he's going to rule well. He has you. A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it? Oh. After all that's happened-- it sounds strange, I know, but I am-- I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it. Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine. We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon. I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm. King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.  And we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace. The Second Sons took the Meereenese navy. Who told you to take the navy? No one. So why did you do it? I heard you liked ships. How many ships? How many men can they carry? Would that be enough to take King's Landing? The Lannisters have more. They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning. It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing. can't conquer Westeros. The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea. The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have. There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself \"His Imperial Majesty.\" Please leave me. Not you, Jorah. It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned. You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable. You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well. How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me? You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons. I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros. What, then? I will do what queens do. I will rule. Pull up your hood. A memorable shade. But how would they know? You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet. Is this the only way into the Eyrie? The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in 1,000 years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000. Who would pass the Bloody Gate? Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne. Stand to. - Stand to! - Stand to! Welcome back, Lord Baelish. Uncle Petyr! My lord. Oh. I have brought you a gift. Lord Baelish. - My lady. - Look what Uncle Petyr brought me. A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al-- Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me. My flesh and blood. It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa. You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else. Of course. I understand. No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position. I would never say a thing. The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like. Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head. They did, and my father's. They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't. Make him fly? Through the Moon Door. And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll. They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to. I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you? No. - We never--  Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin. It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin. Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs. Go. We'll speak soon. What took you so long? Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive. She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening. Let's get married tonight. Ought we not inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony? There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me. I do think that we could wait until-- I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember? Like it was yesterday. What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine-- when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters-- The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real. Tonight it is, then. Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately. I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea. When will the wedding take place in your mind? As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband. - A fortnight? - That seems reasonable. No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals. And your wedding to Loras? Shortly after Tommen's. - Shortly? - A fortnight. I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him. We had that in common. You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust. Then whom can we trust? Ourselves alone. The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side. Robert wasn't particularly rich. Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth. I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one. Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year? Haven't a clue. Go on, your best guess. Pounds, tons, ounces? Doesn't matter. The answer is the same. That can't be. Our last working mine ran dry three years ago. Then how do we pay for anything? The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money. How much? A tremendous amount. There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement. The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone. Someone does work there. It is comprised of people. And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is-- a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect. It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do. I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you. I respect that. We don't need to discuss it. The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire? Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain. Would you shut up? I can't sleep until I say the names. The names of every fucking person in Westeros? Only the ones I'm going to kill. Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list. If he were here right now, what would you do? I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men. I'm almost done. Only one name left. Go on. The Hound. Thank you. Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know? - Really? - Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat. My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food. This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them? They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here. Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder. Yes. I'm very lucky. He feels responsible for you. Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful. Why? Why does he feel responsible for you? Well, I'm half Tully. - He loved your family so much. - Loved your mother. - No. - That's what you wanted to say. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you. Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. - Has he told you about them? - No. He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies? -  No, never. - Are you pregnant? What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-- I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body? - Aunt Lysa, no, I-- - Your young, pretty body. - Nothing. I'm a virgin. - Don't lie to me. You're hurting me. I'll know if you lie. I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. - Not once, not ever. - Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm. Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse? Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters. Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather. That's a long way off. Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point. Never, my lady. I'm your squire. I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now. All knights have squires, my lady. I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you. I swore an oath, my lady. I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave. I know. What do you think will happen if you leave? They'll say I wasn't a very good squire. - The hell you doing? - Practicing. - What, ways to die? - No one's going to kill me. They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight. It's not fighting. It's water dancing. Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite? The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos. Braavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are. What do you know about anything? I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt. - It was not. - Was? He dead? - Yes. - How? - He was killed. - Who by? Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-- Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant? - He was outnumbered. - Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants. Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick. The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends. Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword. Your Grace. Prince Oberyn. Writing letters? A poem, actually. May I show you the gardens? I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort. No, you couldn't. I didn't realize you were a poet. Not a very good one. For your paramour? For one of my daughters. You have several, don't you? Eight. Eight? Eight daughters? The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia. Beautiful name. Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry. Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they? Which joke is that? You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love? We can avenge them. Yes, we can avenge them. You really believe Tyrion murdered your son? I know he did. We will have a trial and we will learn the truth. We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year. The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun. I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy. You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne. Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again. Anything at all. The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water. I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her. Please tell her her mother misses her very much. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Hells. Gods. Did you remove the skin? No, my lady. Have you ever cooked a rabbit before? No, my lady. Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion? No, my lady. That was the cooks. What are you doing? I'm helping you with your armor. I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much. What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion? I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine. Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat? I killed a man. Who? A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater. How did you kill a Kingsguard? I pushed a spear through the back of his head. Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps. Hey. Hey, get up. Get up. That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing. Aye. What we need is a girl there. I've got to have a piss. Now keep quiet. You need water. It doesn't matter. Of course it matters. You mustn't let anything stop you. They already have stopped me. No. You're not here. You're far from here. What does that mean? At the hill. A great weirwood tree. You've seen it, too. Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it. We will. This-- this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet. How will we know the end? You'll know. Brothers. You do move quiet. - How many? - 11 men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie. Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife. Have you seen what I can do with a knife? Not yet. There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it. Why? They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better. New moon tonight. Get some rest. We move at sundown. I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left. Get her up. Stop. Stop. What are you doing? Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Stop. Stop! - Hodor. Hodor. - Stop! - Please. -  Hodor. - Please, get off her! - Hodor. Hodor. Please! Please, leave her alone! Please, stop. Stop. -  What are you doing? Leave her alone! -  Hodor. Hodor. -  No! - Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Shh. You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you? If you let my sister go, I can help you. You can help me? I can. And how you gonna do that? I have the sight. I can see things. That's very helpful. Things that haven't happened yet. What a fine thing. A fine thing. Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister? No. Don't close your eyes. I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones. To arms! They're here, the Night's Watch. Rescue party is here, lads. Lady. - Is Jon with you? - Aye. I'll take you to him. You're Brandon Stark? Hodor. Hodor. The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy. Jon! Jon! Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear? Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose. -  Hodor, get his knife. - Hodor. Cut me loose, Hodor. Jojen and Meera, free them. Go! Jon. Jon! If he sees you, he won't let you go north. - He's my brother. - And wants to protect you. He'll take you back to Castle Black. You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven? - Hodor. - Hodor. We need to free Summer. And we need to go. Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial? We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like. You learn how to fight in a castle? Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry? How to fight with honor? You know what's wrong with honor? You. Are you all right? Come with me. Come on. We lost four brothers? Five. What the seven hells could do that to a man? I count 10 dead mutineers. Locke said there were 11 of them. Where's Rast? - Here's another. - Jon. Where in seven hells? Come here. I missed you, boy. What should we do with this lot? It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe. Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way. You want to stay here in Craster's Keep? Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.", "summary": ["Plot Cersei and Tywin plot the Crown's next move. Dany discusses future plans. Jon Snow embarks on a new mission.  Summary In Meereen Dany decision Daenerys makes her decision to stay and rule in Meereen.  In her new headquarters atop the Great Pyramid, Daenerys learns of Joffrey's death and Tommen's coronation. She is irritated to learn that Daario Naharis has captured Meereen's navy without her explicit orders to do so, but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for Westeros and taking King's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons. Barristan Selmy is optimistic about their chances, believing that old Westerosi families will flock to their cause once Daenerys crosses the Narrow Sea, swelling their numbers. Jorah Mormont is less enthusiastic: while 10,000 troops should be enough to take King's Landing from its exhausted defenders, there's still the rest of the continent to worry about. Her advisors then reveal more troubling news: the Wise Masters have bounced back and re-enslaved every freed man in Yunkai, and although Astapor remains free, the council Daenerys installed has been deposed by a butcher named Cleon. Daenerys dismisses everyone but Jorah and muses that her plans are in shambles. He reminds her that she is the last Targaryen and the Mother of Dragons, but Dany says she needs to be more than that. She laments that if she cannot keep order in three cities, she has no hope of controlling seven kingdoms. She is therefore resolved to remain in Meereen and \"do what queens do\" by ruling.  At King's Landing Tommens-Coronation Tommen is crowned by the High Septon.  Tommen is crowned king of the Seven Kingdoms, while Cersei makes what appears to be a peaceful gesture towards Margaery, who remains wary. Cersei talks to Prince Oberyn and asks him a favor. She hasn't seen her daughter, Myrcella, in over a year. Cersei asks Oberyn to take her daughter a gift, a ship, since Cersei missed her last nameday.   \u200bTywin reveals to Cersei their problem with the Iron Bank of Braavos; they owe 'a tremendous sum,' and the gold mines of the Westerlands actually ran dry three years ago. Therefore, even though Tywin admits the Lannisters can trust nobody except themselves, they need the Tyrells' wealth and resources on their side. Cersei suggests coming to some arrangement with one of the Bank\u2019s representatives, but Tywin dismisses the idea, since the Bank is a monolithic structure that cannot be avoided, lied to or swayed.  In the Riverlands Brienne riding with podrick Podrick riding with Brienne.  While on the road, Podrick proves to be a hindrance to Brienne. He has problems with his horse and accidentally sets fire to a rabbit they were cooking. Brienne tries to get rid of Podrick by releasing him from the vow he swore as her squire, but to no avail. They are bound for Castle Black, where Brienne believes Sansa may have taken refuge with her half-brother, Jon Snow. Brienne questions Podrick about his duties as squire to Tyrion. He tells her his job was mostly pouring wine, alongside other menial tasks. Brienne then asks if Podrick did anything related to combat. Podrick reveals how he killed Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard by shoving a spear through his head when he tried to kill Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater. Brienne then grants Podrick a bit of respect and allows him to help her remove her armor.  In the Vale of Arryn Littlefinger reveal Lysa reminds Petyr she killed her husband at his behest.  Lord Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark arrive safely at the Bloody Gate, though Petyr has Sansa cover her hair, as auburn is widely known as a Tully trait, and introduces her as his niece, Alayne. Upon arriving at the Eyrie itself, Sansa tries to slip into her alias, but her aunt, Lysa Arryn, tells her not to bother around her own flesh and blood. Lysa laments Sansa's treatment in King's Landing, ignoring her niece's attempts to defend Tyrion's character. Robin Arryn is delighted to see Petyr and to show his cousin Sansa the Moon Door. Lysa, apparently having finally given Robin some independence, reminds him never to reveal Sansa's identity and tells him to show her to her chambers. The instant they leave, Lysa insists she wants to marry Petyr immediately, claiming that they already had a wedding night many years ago. She references poisoning her former husband's wine and framing the Lannisters by writing to her sister Catelyn, using these actions as proof of her love for Petyr. Petyr is unable to deter her, particularly when Lysa reveals that a Septon and witnesses have been waiting outside the main door. A delighted Lysa declares that she will scream so loudly that night that they will be able to hear her across the Narrow Sea. Later that night, an exasperated Sansa attempts to sleep as Lysa tries to fulfil that promise.  Later on, Lysa has a meal with Sansa, giving her some lemon cakes. Sansa, relieved to be safe at last, indulges herself, though she becomes a little self-conscious when Lysa begins telling stories of Catelyn's overeating in her youth. Lysa encourages Sansa to keep eating, as she was only telling a story, and anyway, Petyr had three crates of lemons brought from the Crownlands just for Sansa's cakes. Lysa suddenly degenerates from a kindly aunt into a psychotic newlywed half-mad with jealousy and demands to know why Petyr cares so much about Sansa, and if he has slept with her as he has his whores. She also rants about Catelyn's love for Sansa's uncle Brandon and how he nearly killed Petyr. Horrified, Sansa weeps and insists that she is still a virgin and that Petyr thinks she's just a stupid girl who doesn't know anything, and who cannot lie at all so always tells the truth. Lysa immediately calms down and comforts Sansa, assuring her that she believes her, and that since neither Tyrion nor Petyr had slept with her, Sansa can proceed to marry Robin. Sansa seems unsure of what to make of this information, but one thing is clear: King's Landing has made her a consummate actress.  On the road to the Eyrie, Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark continue to spar verbally and physically, particularly when Clegane disparages Arya's water dancing and insults Syrio Forel for being defeated by a glorified thug like Meryn Trant.  Beyond the Wall At Craster's Keep, Locke scouts the keep for the party of the Night's Watch sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there; in his reconnaissance, Locke finds the hut where Bran Stark, Jojen, Meera and Hodor are being held captive. Reporting back to Jon Snow and the others, Locke tells them that only eleven traitors are present and most of them are drunk and won't prove much of a threat. He also lies about the hut where Jon's brother Bran and his group are being imprisoned, claiming there are only hounds kept inside and that they should keep away from it to prevent the dogs alerting their enemy. Believing Locke, Jon agrees and tells the party they attack at nightfall.  That night, Karl enters the prisoners' hut and attempts to rape Meera, but Jojen distracts Karl when he reveals his possession of greensight and claims to have seen Karl dead before the night is out. At that moment, Rast rushes in to warn Karl the keep is under attack; Jon's party rush through the defenses and start killing their traitorous former brethren. In the confusion, Locke slips into the tent and attempts to abduct Bran, but Bran wargs into Hodor and uses him to kill Locke. Bran spots Jon in the fighting and wants to go to him, but Jojen prevents him from going to his older brother, reminding Bran that they must continue onward to reach the Three-Eyed Raven and that Jon would stop them in an effort to protect Bran as his older brother. Bran reluctantly leaves despite being so close to Jon.\u200b  The Night's Watch swiftly overcome their enemy and Jon confronts Karl in single combat. Karl's use of dirty tactics learned in his criminal past gives him the upper hand. Before he can finish Jon, one of Craster's wives, Sissy, stabs him from behind. When Karl rounds on her, Jon gets back to his feet and drives Longclaw through the back of Karl's skull, killing him.  S04E5 - Craster&#039;s Keep on fire Craster's Keep burns.  In the aftermath of the battle, four brothers of the Night's Watch, including Locke, are found dead, while all the traitors but one are accounted for. Locke's true intentions are never discovered. The sole surviving mutineer, Rast, runs in terror through the forest until he reaches the cage where Ghost was held. He notices someone has opened the cage but before he can absorb this, the direwolf lunges out of nowhere and kills him. Ghost then finds his way back to Jon, who is overjoyed to see his companion again. Speaking to Craster's wives, Jon warns them that Mance Rayder's army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the Wall, but the women refuse, preferring to set out on their own. Before departing back for Castle Black, Jon has Craster's Keep burned to the ground, along with the bodies of all those who died there."], "review": null}, "35": {"id": "s04e06", "name": "The Laws of Gods and Men", "script": "You're accused of killing the king.

You really believe Tyrion murdered your son? You're still interested in being queen, I take it? It would be a great honor. But I will have to speak to my father about it. I will speak to mine. You started wars to protect this family's future. Tyrion deserves for lighting our future to fire. What kind of knight beats a helpless girl? The kind who serves his king.

We need to look East for ships and men. - Soldiers win wars. - We don't have any gold. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos, which means you're running out of time. Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that-- We've been here since midday. Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest-- Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit. What can we do for you, Lord Stannis? This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him. Yes, we have heard this story. It's not a story. It's the truth. The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold. Gold you loaned him. And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold? More than any man living. Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like \"usurper\" and \"madman\" and \"blood right.\" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you? And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships? None. You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit. My lord. I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles. Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive. The war is over. As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing? - Ser Davos - Humor me. -  Tywin Lannister. - How old is Tywin Lannister? - 67. - 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back? That is a problem for another time. Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.  The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, \"Bring me my red shirt.\" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, \"Two pirate ships!\" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, \"Bring me my red shirt!\" After the battle, the first mate asks, \"Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?\" The captain replies, \"So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed.\" The next morning the lookout screams, \"10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!\" The crew goes silent. They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows \"Bring me my brown pants!\" You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke? Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone. Only half rotted. Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. - And this is-- - I am Lhara. She's an artist, this one, truly. No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise. We? You, me-- we.

But with those big balls of yours how fast can you run? Make for the ship, now. But your brother. My brother is dead. I have a treat for you. A reward. Reward? Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal. I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. - I didn't want them-- - Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now. The britches, too, Reek. Take them off. Do you love me, Reek? Yes, of course, my lord. Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back. But how can-- I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not. Pretend to be who? Theon Greyjoy. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ He is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters. I thank him for his prayers. It was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock. He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing. Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.  I cannot bring back his goats, but I will see he is paid their value three times over. Send the next one in. _ _ Queen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated. I thank you. Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen. Then it is my honor to receive you. My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included. For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him. You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly. Your father crucified innocent children. My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another? I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that. What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated. And what traditions do you speak of? The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun. Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials. And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial? Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world. Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Thank you, my queen. How many more? There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace. Send the next one in. These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships? Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you-- Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I-- The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin? Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord. A coward and a traitor. My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase \"fuck the king\" was uttered. Disgraceful. What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound? seems a generous bounty. Make it 100. What else? More whispers from the east, my lord. The Targaryen girl? Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen. Conquered with what? She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons. Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace. Mormont is spying on her for us. No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated. He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son. Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid. Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world. A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace. Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom. Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with. How, my lord? By force? Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen? Most certainly, my Lord Hand. Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper. Prince Oberyn. Lord Varys Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord. And yet everyone does. You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos? Five years. May I ask why? 'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us. Most of us aren't princes. You are from Essos. Where? Lys? I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely. I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here? It's a long story. One you don't like telling people. People I trust. My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but You did like boys before? Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed. Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either. - What then? -  Nothing. Everybody is interested in something. Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things. Such as? Let me guess, I've been pardoned. Really? Father's orders. Well, we mustn't disappoint Father. Kingslayer! I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty may the gods punish the accused. Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey? No. Did your wife, the Lady Sansa? Not that I know of. How would you say he died, then? Choked on his pigeon pie. So you would blame the bakers? Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it. The crown may call its first witness. Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed. Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing? - Silence. - Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her. Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn. Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance blind eye-- I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store. Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered. By whom? By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned. Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him? Without question. This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside. Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store? It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth. \"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.\" Your own brother said this to you? Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops. Tyrion said, \"And you will know the debt is paid.\" What debt? I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased. Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.  Do you remember the precise nature of this threat? I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, \"Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.\" And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council? Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause. You're excused, Lord Varys. Father, may I ask the witness one question? One. You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys? Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing. We will adjourn for now. Toll the bells in an hour's time. Clear the court! You'd condemn your own son to death? I've condemned no one. The trial is not over. This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it. I know nothing of the sort. - You've always hated Tyrion. - He killed his king. As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother? - It won't be murder. It'll be justice. - Justice? I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly. - He'll be executed. - No, he'll be punished accordingly. Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line. I'm well aware of your oath. What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember? What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer? It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live. Done. When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again. You have my word. And you have mine. Not going well, is it? - You're going to be found guilty. - Oh, you think so? When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch. Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out. Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word. How do you know? Do you trust me? Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon. The crown may call its next witness. State your name. Shae. Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest? I swear it. Do you know this man? Yes. Tyrion Lannister. How do you know him? I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa. This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this? I know that he's guilty. He and Sansa planned it together. Silence! Continue. She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord. He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine. How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid? I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.  I beg your pardon? You said you were his His whore. How did you come to be in his service? He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. \"You belong to me now,\" he said. \"I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world.\" Silence. Silence! And did you? Did I what? Fuck him like it was his last night in this world. I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him \"my lion,\" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, \"I am yours and you are mine.\" Shae. Please don't. I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her. I wish to confess. I wish to confess. You wish to confess? I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all. Tyrion. Do you wish to confess? Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear? You admit you poisoned the king? No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf. You are not on trial for being a dwarf. Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life. Have you nothing to say in your defense? Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores. I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it. Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell. I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.", "summary": ["Plot Stannis and Davos set sail with a new strategy. Dany meets with supplicants. Tyrion faces down his father in the Throne Room.  Summary At the Dreadfort Yara in the dreadfort Yara enters the Dreadfort.  Yara Greyjoy prepares her troops for their assault on the Dreadfort to rescue her brother, Theon. She reads the letter sent by Ramsay Snow, threatening to flay all ironborn who do not leave the North. While Ramsay takes Myranda's virginity and engaging in rather violent sex, Yara and her troops land and scale the walls of the castle. They quietly take out the guards as they search for Theon. Interrogating a guard, Yara learns of Theon's location which is the dog kennels, and Yara then kills the guard, despite promising not to. There, the ironborn and Yara see Theon sitting in a cage. Yara opens the cage, but Theon refuses to go with her, believing it is another cruel trick played by Ramsay. Ramsay and several Bolton troops enter and a fight ensues, with several Bolton and Greyjoy soldiers killed. Theon tells Yara his name has always been Reek, bites her, and cowers in his cage. Ramsay releases the hounds and Yara is forced to retreat to her ship. When one of the ironmen asks about Theon, Yara says Theon is \"dead.\"   Ramsay allows Reek to take a bath, as a reward for his loyalty. Reek fears the bath is another trick but Ramsay assures him it is not. While Reek bathes, Ramsay now plans to assault Moat Cailin and needs Reek to pretend to be someone he isn't: Theon Greyjoy.  At King's Landing Tyrion questions Varys Varys testifies at Tyrion's trial  At a meeting of the Small Council, Tywin informs the councilors that Tyrion's trial will begin that afternoon. Lord Varys informs Tywin that the Hound has been spotted in the Riverlands, and Tywin orders a bounty on his head. Varys also informs the council of Daenerys's conquest of Meereen, and Tywin decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion. In the dungeon, Jaime has Tyrion shackled and brought into the throne room to begin his trial. King Tommen recuses himself from the trial, appointing his grandfather Tywin, Prince Oberyn Martell, and Lord Mace Tyrell as judges. Several witnesses are called for the prosecution, including Ser Meryn Trant, Grand Maester Pycelle, Queen Regent Cersei, and Varys, all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against Tyrion.  At recess, Jaime asks Tywin to spare Tyrion, offering to break his oath to the Kingsguard and return to Casterly Rock, to be his heir. Tywin accepts, telling Jaime that Tyrion will be allowed to join the Night's Watch after being found guilty of Joffrey's murder, provided he pleads for mercy. Before the recess ends, Jaime speaks with Tyrion and urges him to do so. Tyrion is deeply distrustful of the offer, remarking that Eddard Stark was promised the same thing and yet still lost his head, but Jaime pleads with his brother to trust him, insisting that their father will keep his word, and advises him to \"Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts\".  Shae on Stand s4 Laws of Gods  Shae testifying against Tyrion.  Returning to the trial, Tywin orders the next witness to testify: Shae. Her appearance astounds Tyrion and Jaime. She testifies that Tyrion and Sansa planned Joffrey's murder together, claiming that Sansa wanted vengeance for the murder of her father, mother, and brother. She tells the judges of Tyrion's sexual desires, embarrassing him in front of the crowd. Before she can continue, Tyrion, enraged beyond sense, angrily demands that he be allowed to confess his crimes. He angrily roars about how he saved King's Landing from Stannis Baratheon's forces and says he should have let Stannis kill everyone in King's Landing, much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court. Tyrion then claims to be guilty. Tywin assumes that he is guilty for murdering King Joffrey Baratheon. Tyrion denies this, saying he is guilty of a \"far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf!\" Tywin scoffs at Tyrion's claims and says he is not on trial for being a dwarf. Tyrion angrily says he has been on trial for his entire life as a dwarf. Tywin asks if he has nothing to say in his defense. Tyrion then says he has nothing to say in his defense \"but only this.\" He then reveals his true feelings about Joffrey, denying guilt in the king's murder but saying he wished to have killed Joffrey himself. Tyrion then turns his full fury towards Cersei and says that watching her \"vicious bastard\" of a son die gave him more relief than \"a thousand lying whores.\" He then turns around to the court and roars that he wishes to have become the monster they thought he was and would have gladly give his life to watch everyone die from drinking poison. This enrages everyone in the court and Tywin orders Ser Meryn to escort Tyrion back to the dungeons. Before he can be escorted out, Tyrion bellows that he will not lose his life for a crime he did not commit and, knowing that he will get no justice from the court, demands a trial by combat.   In Braavos Davos at the Iron Bank of Braavos Davos convinces the Iron Bank of Braavos to support Stannis.  Stannis Baratheon and Ser Davos visit the Iron Bank of Braavos in hopes of securing funds to aid Stannis' war effort. At first Tycho Nestoris, a representative from the bank, rejects their request, but Davos entreats him and points out that funding Stannis is the best way they could possibly get the gold they loaned to Tywin Lannister back. The Bank agrees to lend them gold, and Davos uses it to once again recruit his old pirate friend Salladhor Saan to Stannis' cause.  In Meereen Dragon Fire Toasty Drogon burning a herd of goats  On one sunny day outside of Meereen, a goat herder and his son are peacefully tending the goats on a hill while the son throws rocks to pass the time. Suddenly, Drogon (now the size of a horse) appears and burns the field and kills a flock of goats while taking one with him. The goat herder travels to Meereen to visit the queen and lays the charred remains of his flock before Daenerys, hoping to not anger the queen and believes it to be punishment. Daenerys apologizes about Drogon's actions and promises to pay back three times the worth of his flock.   After he departs, Hizdahr zo Loraq presents his petition: the right to bury his father's remains in the Temple of the Graces, as he was one of the Meereenese Great Masters crucified on Daenerys's orders. She counters that he was one of the masters that crucified the 163 children. Loraq reveals that his father actually spoke out against the crucifixion of the slave children but was overruled, but later was killed due to Daenerys's judgment anyway. Somewhat mollified, Daenerys allows him to bury his father. As he leaves, Daenerys asks how many more supplicants are waiting; Missandei answers that there are over 200 more."], "review": null}, "36": {"id": "s04e07", "name": "Mockingbird", "script": "I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.  I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit? You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you? Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't-- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it. You fell in love with a whore. Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son. Careful. I'm the last friend you've got. At least I got to tell them what they really are. Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride. Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me. I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand. Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall. Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword. It is tempting. Well Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life. If he wins. Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater. No. Not Ser Meryn. Go on, move it. And you. Come on. Mercy. Please. Please, mercy. Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly. You seem to be in good form. Who am I fighting? Does it matter? Could be food. Could be soldiers. You shouldn't be sitting out here like this. Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down. Who were \"they\"? I stopped asking a while ago. That's not gonna get better. Doesn't seem so. A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough? Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me. So why go on? Habit. Nothing could be worse than this. Maybe nothing is worse than this. Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing. Who are you? My name is Arya. Arya Stark. You her father? Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom. A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work. Wish it were wine. So do I. That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man. The fuck you doing? There's a price on your head. Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off. The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you? You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick. This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list? He can't be. I don't know his name. What's your name? - Rorge. - Thank you. You're learning.  Rangers returning! They return! -  Rangers returning! - Greetings. Didn't think I'd see you again. All right, Jon? Welcome back, brother. Lord Snow. This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew. Come on, Ghost. Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon. I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he? We need to prepare. We've been preparing. We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze. And how would we range north? - We wouldn't. -  Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass? We can't defend the gate against 100,000 men. This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel. Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have. The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel. They won't stop them. Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow. The stewards. Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel? No. Who would that be? - The builders. - Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him? No. Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon. Moving on. First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall. Aye. My lord. You have new clothes. Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs. I sent for you days ago. - I've been a bit busy. - Doing what? My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth. Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl. I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl. She's dim-witted. If I wanted wits, I'd marry you. When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister? Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister. And you understand the rules of inheritance? Falyse is 40 and barren. She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies. She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle. What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time. You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here? You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price. Is it two wives you want or two castles? One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle. I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude. I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude? You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts. Your sister's a Lannister, too. My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it. If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink. Does he frighten you so much? I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep and I'm dead. Why should I risk it? Because you're my friend. Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me? I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more. I understand. I'm sorry it has to be this way. Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place. We had some good days together. Yes, we did. What will you do? I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song? I hope to hear them sing it one day. How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded, but your window is not. I swam to an island a mile offshore for these. Don't do that again. Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers. These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you. Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you. Tell me why you're here. I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world-- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents. I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing. You've ordered us to be night watchmen. And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue. There is only one, and she does not want me. You swore me your sword. My sword is yours till the day I die. So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets? I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best. Very well. Do what you do best. Take off your clothes. Oh. Come in, my queen. Please. I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady. You could never disturb me. I just wanted to speak with you before we left. Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one. No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one. When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, \"Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count.\" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid. It was. I-- humor isn't my strength. That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth. If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided? Not always. Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust. Did you use it with Stannis? No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have. It's only flesh. It needs what it needs. No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home. I understand how you feel. Hmm. But that is impossible. Why? You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself. However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her. Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood. Khaleesi. - You're here early. - Later than some. You don't approve? It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust. You neither approve nor trust. Why would I? The man's a sellsword. Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother? I did. I trust you. Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that? I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai. - You have? - I have. Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control. That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself. Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them. And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning? It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought. Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it. I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi. And now you are helping me show them to freedom. I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai. The man who came to me the other day about burying his father. Hizdahr zo Loraq? He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one. Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind. Yes, Khaleesi. No. Tell him you changed my mind. Rat cunts. Fucking whore. You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-- No fire. It'll only take a second. - It won't hurt that much. - No fire! Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going. I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword. My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop. Why? Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own? Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least. Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you. Couldn't agree more, my lady. Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer. - Yes, my lady. - Don't get drunk. No, my lady. Can I get you anything else? No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful. Thanks. I do my best. A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight? No. Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts? We're looking for someone. Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17-- A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name. Starks? What, like them lot from \"Winterhell\"? No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here. I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home. Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie? What? It's nothing, my lady. You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing. Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't. You're not interesting enough to be offensive. The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa. My lady. My lord. Could I have a word? What about? Not kidney pie. You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister Arya. No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead. She weren't when I last spoke to her. - When was that? - Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry. - So what happened to her? - Well-- The quick version. The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. -  Not friendly. - The Hound. That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better. Um, you were saying? Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun. They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady. Why the Eyrie? Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who. Sansa could be there, too. Aye, my lady. Could be. You sure about this? No. I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour. I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day. Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like. Your sister. Oh. Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself. Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts. It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed. She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time. Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago. I think I would have remembered that. Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, not your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment you. You and my family have more in common than you might admit. The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy. That would have made things so much easier. When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, \"Soon.\" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. \"That's not a monster,\" I told Cersei. \"That's just a baby.\" And she said, \"He killed my mother.\" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. \"It doesn't matter,\" she told us. \"Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.\" Well sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants. And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children. If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place. I disagree. I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion. Hello, Robin. What are you doing? I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time. Why did you leave? It's a long story. I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person. Yes, you certainly are. When will you go back? Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down. Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door? No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground. That sounds dangerous. - How do you make people fly? - We don't. What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like? I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from. Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door. I like the sound of that. Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell. All right. It can go in here in this big tower. Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing. - I didn't ruin it. - You did. It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it. Knocking things down isn't fixing them. - It's ruining them. - I didn't ruin it! - You're being stupid. - I didn't ruin it! Robin, I'm sorry, I-- Children. -  I hit him. - Yes, I saw. I shouldn't have done that. No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction. If he tells Aunt Lysa Let me worry about Aunt Lysa. I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again. A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one. Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why. I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world. You're more beautiful than she ever was. Lord Baelish Call me Petyr. You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa? Come here, Sansa. Do you know how far the fall is? No. Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did. I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-- Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr. - I didn't. You don't understand. - I saw you. You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes. - He kissed me. I pulled away. - Liar! Whore! He is mine! My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down! Lysa! Let her go. You want her? This empty-headed child? Let her go. She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why? I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa. Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife. I have only loved one woman only one, my entire life. Your sister.", "summary": ["Plot Tyrion enlists an unlikely ally. Daario entreats Dany to allow him to do what he does best. Jon's warnings about the Wall's vulnerability fall on deaf ears. Brienne follows a new lead on the road with Pod.  Summary At King's Landing Tyrion-bronn Tyrion and Bronn  In his cell, Tyrion and Jaime discuss Tyrion's fate and the irony of Lord Tywin striking down both his heirs if Jaime were to die being Tyrion's champion; Jaime declines to be Tyrion's champion as he cannot fight well enough with his left hand. Tyrion then requests Jaime to bring him Bronn, hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the Eyrie.  Elsewhere, Gregor Clegane, known by most as 'the Mountain,' is mercilessly killing prisoners with a greatsword. Cersei approaches him and thanks him for his haste in returning to King's Landing as her champion for the trial by combat. Gregor asks who he will be fighting, Cersei asks if it matters, and he shakes his head.  Bronn visits Tyrion in the clothes of a lord, having been betrothed to Lollys Stokeworth, by Cersei's doing. He refuses to fight the Mountain, both for lack of a reward and believing Clegane is too dangerous for him to face, and bids farewell to Tyrion, who while heartbroken by Bronn's decision, understands.  Oberyn visits Tyrion - Mockingbird Oberyn visits Tyrion in his cell.  Later, Tyrion is approached by Oberyn Martell, who tells Tyrion of his disappointment in their first encounter: as children, Oberyn and his sister Elia were told stories of the \"Lannister Monster\" and his extreme deformities. During a childhood visit to Casterly Rock, Cersei showed Tyrion, with great ceremony, to Oberyn and Elia. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he saw no monster, just a baby. Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that Tyrion killed her mother, and then cruelly assaulted Tyrion until Jaime stopped her. Oberyn says that he and Elia were quite disturbed at Cersei's already strong hatred toward Tyrion, who is disturbed by Cersei's relentless hatred as his eyes tear up. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he seeks justice for the death of his sister, and Tyrion replies, \"You are in the wrong place.\" Oberyn counters that he is in the perfect place; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister's murder are close at hand. Intending to start his revenge with Gregor Clegane, Oberyn offers his service as Tyrion's champion in the coming trial by combat.  MountainSeason4 The Mountain practices for Tyrion's trial by combat.  In Meereen Daario visits daenerys Daario visits Daenerys in her private chambers.  Daenerys is surprised by Daario in her private chambers. She feigns outrage at the intrusion, but agrees to hear his complaints. Daario laments that he is only good at two things, killing men and sleeping with women, and that he has no opportunities to pursue either strength. Dany counters that the Second Sons are currently acting as Meereen's police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him; Daario dismisses the Second Sons' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants isn't interested. He begs Daenerys to send him and the Second Sons to make real war. Dany focuses on Daario's other proclaimed talent and orders him to remove his clothes. The following morning, Daario bumps into Ser Jorah. He also says that it's a good time to talk to the queen, as she is in a very good mood, implying that he and Daenerys had just been intimate. Jorah is not amused, but Daenerys dismisses concerns about her intimate life. Daenerys tells Jorah that she sent Daario to take the Second Sons to Yunkai to regain control over the city and kill the masters that have resurfaced. Jorah relates to the mercy shown by Eddard Stark for his dealings in slavery and convinces Daenerys to bring the masters to justice without execution. Daenerys considers for a moment and then tells Jorah to assign Hizdahr zo Loraq as her ambassador to offer the masters a choice: they can live free in the new world she wants to create, or they can die clinging to their old one. The Second Sons will be stationed in Yunkai to enforce whichever choice the masters make. She also says to let Daario know that it was Jorah who changed her mind.  At Dragonstone Selyse-baratheon-lady-melisandre-640x424 Selyse speaks with Melisandre.  Queen Selyse speaks to Melisandre, who is enjoying a bath. She quips that the Lord of Light told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over Selyse's head. To cement Selyse's position as Melisandre's most devoted follower, the Red Priestess tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the Lord of Light and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on. Selyse asks her if she used the potions when she slept with Stannis, to which she replies that she did not. Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's \"heresy\" as she always is, and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going. At Castle Black Jon and his fellow brothers return from Craster's Keep. At first sight of his direwolf, Ghost, Alliser Thorne sends his \"beast\" away, outside Castle Black.  Afterwards, Jon tries to convince the Night's Watch to barricade the Wall against the imminent wildling invasion by blocking off Castle Black's entry tunnel with ice and rock. He is denied after being reminded of his place in the Watch, when the First Builder reluctantly agrees with Thorne's assessment of their chances of defending the tunnel. Jon and Sam are sent to serve as sentries on top of the Wall until Mance arrives.  In the Riverlands Arya and Sandor encounter a \u200bdying man in a ransacked village. Sandor gives the man a gift of mercy by stabbing him in the heart. Sandor is ambushed by Biter, and is bitten on the neck. He snaps Biter's neck and drops him dead in the dirt. Rorge encounters them, and after a short conversation, in which he reveals that Joffrey is dead (crossing him off of Arya's death list), Arya kills him with a quick thrust of Needle to his heart, earning some approval from Sandor. Afterward, Sandor clumsily addresses his wounds from Biter. Arya suggests burning to cauterize his wound, but is rebuffed due to his fear of fire. Sandor confirms the story of his facial scars from burns inflicted by Gregor's wrath and how his father covered up the truth, making him feel alone. Arya offers to clean and stitch him up, and Sandor allows her to.  Hotpiepodrickbriennetalkinginn Meanwhile, Brienne and Podrick stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than Hot Pie, who proceeds to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients. He then asks of Brienne's business, to which she replies that she is in Lady Stark's service to find and protect Sansa Stark. Hot Pie leaves after addressing the Starks as traitors. As Brienne and Podrick prepare to leave the inn, Podrick reminds Brienne that telling people of their quest could be dangerous, but Brienne's honesty is swiftly rewarded when Hot Pie approaches and gives them a loaf of bread shaped like a wolf. He tells them that he knows nothing of Sansa, but has seen her sister Arya alive, along with the Hound. Brienne is surprised because Arya has been presumed dead since she disappeared when her father Ned was executed. They deduce that Arya's captor is probably going to try to ransom Arya somewhere. Having memorized the complex family trees of the Great Houses, Podrick surmises that Arya's aunt Lysa Arryn is the Hound's only remaining chance of a reward for her. Therefore, Brienne and Podrick decide to head for the Eyrie.  At the Eyrie While wandering the Eyrie's snow-covered courtyards, Sansa builds a snow replica of Winterfell. Robin chances upon her and seems impressed with her efforts. The cousins get along until Robin asks where the Moon Door is. Sansa tells him Winterfell doesn't need a Moon Door. Sansa agrees to add one, but in the process, Robin accidentally knocks over a tower. Robin insists she replicate the tower. This irritates Sansa and Robin throws a tantrum in response, destroying the replica. Unable to control her anger, Sansa slaps Robin. Sansa immediately softens and tries to apologize, but before she can Robin threatens to tell his mother and runs away. Petyr Baelish witnesses the action and assures Sansa that he will deal with Lysa, whom he says should have disciplined her child long ago. Petyr muses on how he should have been Sansa's father, but then tells Sansa that she is more beautiful than her mother Catelyn and kisses Sansa, who is so shocked that she doesn't resist. Unknown to the pair, the kiss is seen by Lysa.  Game-Of-Thrones-S4Ep7-Mockingbird-Review-Kate-Dickie-as-Lysa-Arryn-thrown-out-of-the-moon-door Lysa is pushed out the Moon Door.  Later, Sansa is summoned by Lysa, who delights in telling Sansa the gory details about Moon Door executions. Lysa then grabs Sansa and threatens to throw her through the opening for kissing Petyr. She is stopped when Petyr arrives and swears by everything he can think of that he will send Sansa away. Lysa releases Sansa and embraces Petyr, who assures Lysa that he only ever loved one woman - her sister. Lysa has only an instant to contemplate this betrayal, as Petyr shoves her out of the Moon Door and looks down as she plummets to her death hundreds of feet below.  "], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605[Spoilers, and some gloating about a prediction]Who would have thought Mr. \"We cannot choose who we love\" would express contempt at his brother for loving a whore. That being said, Jaime's exchange with Tyrion was indeed golden, and reaffirmed their deep fraternal bond despite all the gloom and doom. This scene surprised me because it portrayed how Tyrion's call for combat last episode was not in fact another one of his well-devised plans but rather an impulsive move that could have gone horribly wrong had the Red Viper not intervened. But more on that later.The show tries to serve us some gore immediately after, but unfortunately Game of Thrones seems to have recast a lovable little contestant from \"World's Strongest Man\" in place of the horse-beheader from season one.Some more disappointment follows in Essos as the episode anti-climaxes heavily on the Dany-Daario romance, and shows me Daario and Melisandre when I wanted Daenerys. I took half a star away for this. However, Jorah and Daario's awkward morning-after scene was one of two absolutely hilarious scenes in this episode. One has to wonder if Dany's short-term strategy of keeping all her commanders happy (sorry, not all - Barristan still hasn't come into the Queen's good graces) will breed jealousy or worse in the future.The episode's weakest scenes are the ones with Melisandre and Lord Snow, despite the former making us wonder what the future holds in store for little Shireen. On a related note, what has the Thenn has been doing all this while? Eating Ygritte?The first Sandor-Arya scene was a lot of ado about nothing, but the later one was beautiful. I am a little scared for the Hound though. We have already lost one fierce warrior to a festered wound.The show once again lets two side characters play pivotal roles as Hot Pie and Podrick give Brienne's search new direction.Bronn characteristically serves up some cool lines and gives Tyrion the simple mantra to a blissful life in Westeros - I like you. I just like myself more. What made this scene particularly poignant for me was Tyrion trying to put up a brave face right before clutching on to Bronn's hand in what was a desperate, final plea. Enter Prince Oberyn. His \"your sister\" quip was the second scene this episode that had me in splits. A beautiful anecdote later, the Red Viper, accompanied by heroic background tunes, announces himself as Tyrion's champion and gives both Tyrion and me a major fist pump moment.By this time, I had begun to wonder where our Mockingbird was. Sansa slapping Robin had me worrying about her fate, but Paedo-Petyr intervenes. Sansa's happiness at Baelish's proclamation that he killed Joffrey because of the love he had for her mother, quickly turns to shock as he kisses her moments after telling her she should have been his daughter.The ending scene however was far too predictable. Sansa flying would have been a certified OMG moment; Lysa, less so. You even see Baelish's revelation about his life's only love coming, and this probably takes off another half a star from the episode.Alas, 14 days to the next episode.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605An enthralling episode.Spoilers Alert!The Trial Before CombatNaturally that is the first thing we want to see happen. But not yet. Tyrion finds it difficult to arrange for a Champion. Jamie backs sighting his one hand. Bronn proves the evil bastard he is when he reveals Cersei had bribed him by arranging to marry him with Lolly Stocksworth and the possibility of him inheriting the Castle. But Peter Dinklage rules the dungeon scenes. His minute expressions of delight and hope and desperation while trying to persuade Jamie and Bronn to fight for him was really impressive. That statement \"Oh! You are the Golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand and **** your own sister\" shows how desperate Tyrion has become losing his practicalness.The MountainHaf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson or \"Thor\" as the Mountain is strong and gigantic. His wikipedia page says he has been one of the World's Strongest Men for the last couple of years. But will he win the trial? He seems slow to be such a fearful warrior. And his introduction (of killing terrified unworthy civilians) is not that terrifying at all. I was reminded of the old bollywood Villain intro scenes where the Villain would kill a man just to show the audience that he is a Villain. Not effective. Let us see how he fights in the trial.Arya the PhilosopherArya is evolving. They encounter a dying man and engages in a philosophical conversation before the Hound killing him by stabbing his heart. When Arya says \"Nothing isn't better than anything. Nothing is just nothing\", it sounds as if she started looking life at a colder way. My favourite statement for the week.They learn that the Lannisters had kept a bounty on the Hound's head through Rorge and his friend who were trying to capture the Hound. The Hound breaks the other man's neck while Arya stabs Rorge precisely in his heart imitating Hound's killing of the elderly man. Every man has his story and the Hound too proves to have a soft heart. A heart that once longed for his brother's love. He reveals how his face was burnt by his brother for allegedly stealing his toy. Touching, logical but a little boring.The Knight's WatchJon returns to the Knight's Watch bringing the news of Mance's army approaching and they will reach before full moon. He recommends to seal the tunnel as they are already 100,000 men strong and the Watch won't be able to withstand the Giants. But Ser Alliser in his usual way teases Jon and puts him to guard the Wall until Full Moon refusing not to seal the tunnel. Khaleesi's funDaario visits Khaleesi and encounters Ser Jorah on his way out. Oh boy Oh! You should definitely look at the jealously on Ser Jorah's face. In the discussion following, she informs him of her decision to send Darrio to retake Yunkai from the rebelled Slave Masters and to execute them. Jorah persuades her to teach the Maesters of good things rather than killing them citing his own example of how Ned Stark changed his life.BrienneBrienne and Pod encounter Hot Pie in the inn and hearing that Arya is still alive, Brienne shifts her search towards Arya. Pod on the other hand seems to be thinking clearly when he points out that they shouldn't too vocal about Starks in a Lannister Land.Oberyn the SaviorThen comes the much awaited sequence of the episode. I was expecting things to come to this from the way the last episode ended. Cersei had blocked all the routes of Tyrion hiring a champion and the only way for the trial to happen is Tyrion fighting for himself. But the arrival of the Mountain to the Capital should alerted everyone. Seeing the chance, Oberyin who has been waiting for the chance to avenge her Sister's rape by the Mountain comes forward to be Tyrion's champion. But\u00a0 the recollection of his visit to Casterly Rock when Tyrion was a just born and how Cersei ill-treated the just born Tyrion was a really intense scene.Sansa and her Ill fateSansa encounters her first snow after leaving to the South. Eventually Petyr kisses her while her Aunt Lysa witnesses this and threatens her of pushing down the Moon Door. That witch is mad. She gave no ears to Sansa's claim that it was only Petyr who kissed her and she withdrew. Petyr comes into the court asking Lysa to let go of Sansa but he himself pushes her off the Moon Door. Sure Lysa is a mad witch but I won't say she is evil. It was Petyr who used her for his purposes and finally kills her throwing down the door. What will happen now? Had Robin witnessed this? What will happen to Sansa now? Will Petyr marry her? Lots of questions .", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605For the most part, this was one of the better episodes of the season, even if it did have a couple of low moments. Spoilers if you haven't watched this episode yet.First, the things that should have been said by the characters this episode.\"I sell my sword, I don't give it away.

Oh, Petyr, do you swear it? Only one?\u201d \u201cOnly Cat.\u201d He gave her a short, sharp shove.Book readers' disappointments aside, this episode was fairly fast-paced, going through significant moments in many different story lines.King's LandingNothing happened there that isn't related to the next episode, The Mountain and the Viper. I thought all of Tyrion's visitors had great things to say - Jaime's disappointment, Bronn's indifference, and Oberyn's thirst for vengeance. I was surprised when Jaime said, \"You loved a whore\", and I am glad that he didn't take it any further. I didn't expect the name of Lollys Stokeworth would be mentioned in the series, either. But the scene with Oberyn was incredible. Most notably Tyrion's reaction to the flashback.\u00a0 We also got a small (yeah) measure of the Mountain - introducing the new actor cast in the role, as well as reminding us of the monstrosity that he is.The RiverlandsThe recap of this episode showed Rorge and Biter, and I was sure they were going to do something expected this episode. I never expected Arya to kill Rorge off like that - I really don't like the way they are rushing things with her. Biter bites a chunk off the Hound, and we see more of the dynamic between Arya and the Hound. Or Sandor, I should say, as we witnessed the human, vulnerable side of his, remembering his family. Brienne's visit at the Inn is advanced considerably - A Feast for Crows territory, though I guess it didn't matter because Rorge/Biter are already dead. Their interaction with Hot Pie was fun to watch, especially that we see how naive Brienne is, dropping the name of Sansa at will. Hot Pie's return with a pastry direwolf 2.0 helped Brienne change her mission parameters, and in spite of her smugness, Pod is the one who's thinking clearly.MeereenDany and Daario. And Daario being sent to Yunkai. This episode really is rushing into things. We see an escalation in Dany's character, who had given the order to kill all the Wise Masters of Yunkai, just like that. At least it's a good thing that she still listens to reason when Jorah shows it to her. The WallAlliser Thorne isn't going to heed Jon's warnings. Nothing new there. I think that scene was included just so we won't forget what's coming. As if we would.DragonstoneThis was a waste of running time. I am not going to talk about it. Well, except that I fear for Shireen. What did Melisandre mean?The EyrieIt opens with Sansa's first snow since she rode down south. This is the closest she had even been to home in a long time.We see how much she misses it from the way she rebuilds Winterfell, if only in snow. Robert Arryn shows he's still that same willful child who wanted to see Tyrion fly, but Sansa's slap was a surprise. And Littlefinger taking advantage of Sansa was not. Lysa finally pays the price for trusting the likes of him.Overall, I will give this four stars as a watcher (maybe three as a reader), it was almost as good as last week's episode, in my opinion.The preview for the next episode shows the much awaited trial by combat, after Theon's taken to a Moat Cailin the size of Casterly Rock, more Sansa at the Eyrie, and the wildlings arriving at Mole's Town. The only horrible thing about that preview, is that we won't get to watch the episode for two weeks this time.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Obvious spoilers for those who haven't seen the episode yet.Mockingbird is another one of those \"filler episodes\" that sets up a lot of different things and ends with a long-expected climax. It absolutely didn't disappoint, and it had some great acting and character development. I wish they would have spent more time with the titular character Petyr Baelish, though. We only get to see him in the last 9 minutes.In this episode, we see a lot of the aftermath of Tyrion's trial, as he desperately tries to find a champion to fight for him in his trial by combat. And after he has to give up on Jaime and Bronn to come to his rescue, he gets his hopes up by a very unlikely champion, in a scene that's brilliantly acted by Peter Dinklage and Pedro Pascal.Arya and the Hound have some great scenes together (as always). Arya learns from the Hound as he teaches her where the heart is (which she immediately brings into practice). And the Hound opens up to her by allowing her to treat his wounds. They are starting to bond more in every episode, which is great.At the other end of the world, Dany is having a one to one with Daario Naharis, after which she sends him to take back Yunkai and kill all the masters. I have to say that I don't really care for the Dany/Daario romance plot, but I do like the conversation that she has with Jorah. He convinces her to be lenient and to spare the masters.Brienne and Pod are still on their merry quest to find the Stark sisters, as they are helped by a familiar face. It's great to see Hot Pie again! :)And then we finally get to the titular plot in the Vale. It involves one scene I was dreading, and one I was looking forward to. The dreadful scene is the one where Petyr is hitting on Sansa. Sure, they made Sansa older in the show, but he still comes across as a pervert. I literally shivered when I watched this.The scene I was looking forward to, comes right after that. Lysa threatens to throw Sansa out of the Moon Door for kissing Petyr.

Killer ending (no pun intended), but the pacing of each show is exhausting. There two scenes that really stand out; the last one, and the one where the Prince of Dorne volunteers as Tyrion's as champion. Everything else just seemed really.....eh to me. Compared to another HBO show, Veep, Game of Thrones really struggles with maintaining my active interest in what is happening on screen. There are moments where the pacing is a lot better, but damn, there is so many \"character development\" scenes that I'm twiddling my thumbs and checking my phone during the show. I'd like to blame it on the ADHD, but c'mon, it's HBO...Because I now watch these shows mainly on HBO GO now, I literally skipped ahead of the scene with the Scarlet-headed women*, as well as the Khaleesi/replaced-actor thing.\u00a0 *Am I the only person who doesn't know the names of any of the supporting characters on this show?"]}, "37": {"id": "s04e08", "name": "The Mountain and the Viper", "script": "Here we are. Ready? \"The Rains of Castamere.\" You fucking deaf? Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, you cunt. Oh! \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair.\" There's a man with an ear. Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your breeches down, I thought you were a eunuch. You've seen it, girls. Like a baby snail peeking out of his shell. Your baby was crying this morning. Woke me up. You hear me? Yes. Well, got anything to say? I'm sorry he woke you up. I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet or I will. Don't you ever touch him. Little wildling bitch. You should have stayed with your own kind. You listening to me? - Shut your mouth. - What? It's just an owl, you dumb bitch. No, it's not. - - Shh. I should never have left her there. - You couldn't have known. - Of course I could've known. They've been raiding the villages close by. And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers. Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black. So it's all right, then? Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?  I didn't say it was all right. I'm saying they shouldn't have been there. We're pledged to guard the realms of men. She's dead because of me. We can't even guard Mole's Town. We can't go after them. You know that. It's what they want. And little Sam. As if I cut their thats self. Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought all of you was dead. You went north with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did. She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the Wall. She survived a white walker, for fuck's sake. She might have got out. She might have. If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance and his army must be close. 100,000 of them. And there's what, You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully? How do 102 men stop 100,000? Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.  You think he was spying on you? No, not spying.  The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see. Yes, Your Grace. But you are not Dothraki. No. Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey Worm isn't interested. None of the Unsullied care what's under our clothes. He was interested. What? I believe he was interested. When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it? All of it? The-- the pillar and the stones. I don't know, Your Grace. Haven't you ever wondered? Yes, Your Grace. Missandei. _ _ _ _ The lessons you give I in common tongue these are precious to I. - To me. - To me. I don't remember teaching you the word precious. Jorah the Andal, he teaches I-- he teaches me this word. Do you remember the name you were given at birth? I remember nothing. Only Unsullied. When they cut you, do you remember that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you. Why? Why sorry? It's a terrible thing to do to a boy. If the masters never cut me, I never am Unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the island of Naath. I am sorry I-- for today. I am sorry. _ _ _ Kraken. Mmm. Strong as long as they're in the sea. When you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slump into a heap of nothing. You'd think they know that. Unfortunately, they're not very bright. What do you tell them? I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands. - And what are you really? - I'm Reek. Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud. I'm Reek. Until when? Always. - Forever. - That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Moat Cailin. No closer. Who are you? I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy? Yes. And why should I believe that? I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the Drowned God. What is dead may never die. What is dead may never die. And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army? Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn. And what does Lord Bolton want? You are fading from sickness, you are badly outnumbered, and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this, and he will be just and fair with you as he has been with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the Stony Shore. He wants us to surrender? My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you. \"No shame.\" \"Fought with honor.\" I'm sorry, I didn't hear. \"No shame.\" \"Fought with honor.\" Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman, boy? You don't know-- The ironborn will not surrender. Reek. My name is Reek You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy, or whoever the fuck you are. My name is Reek. What in the hell are you muttering? I'm Reek. Reek. If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here? Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.  You didn't really think I'd let them go, did you? It's fallen out of fashion, flaying. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history? - Eh? - Yes, my lord. Will we go home now? I believe we will. To our new home. You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish? A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.  Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since. The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce. She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, - it's a wonder your tongue's not black. - My lord-- And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn-- Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood. Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair. Of course. Her suicide shattered us all. She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice. Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door. She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours. We were told there was a witness. A girl. A niece of yours, I believe. A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help. We'd like to speak with her. - Let me fetch her. -  No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated. Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room. - My lady-- - I wasn't asking you. - He can stay. - Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw. I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. I'll tell you everything. Please, Alayne, leave nothing out. My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall. Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm? Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name. Your secret is safe with us, my lady. Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man. Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa. You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then one day she saw him kiss me. Lady Sansa. It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was-- Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault. You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old. Lord Royce! This is hardly the time. Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly. You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same. Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there? For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl. Are you questioning our courage? I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark? Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters. No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now? Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead. I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale. Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy. And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men. More often they die young. I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse. - Aye, it's time. - Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest. Ser Barristan. Yes? Who sent you? - Ser Barristan. - Ser Jorah. Have I forgotten a council meeting? No. What's this? A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her. Who gave you this? Does it matter? Have you told her? I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back. Let me speak with her in private. You'll never be alone with her again. Why did the usurper pardon you? If we could speak alone. No, speak to me here. Explain it to me. Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him. The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged. It is not forged. Why, then? I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing. What was the content of these letters? - Information. - What information? When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died. You told him I was carrying Drogo's child? - I-- - Yes or no? - Khaleesi. - Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child? Yes. That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information. I stopped you from drinking his wine. Because you knew it was poisoned. I suspected. You betrayed me from the first. Forgive me. I never meant-- please, Khaleesi, forgive me. You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father - and stole my brother's throne - I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you. and you want me to forgive you? I have loved you. Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can. Daenerys, please. Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now. Moat Cailin is yours, Father. Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke? No. Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see. Moors, fields, hills. Tell me what you see. Nothing. Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name? Ramsay Snow. No, not Ramsay Snow. Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North. You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise. Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath. Yes? First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me? They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty. That's not an answer. If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me? I don't know. Neither do I. Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me? I know what you want. Do you? I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy. - Lots of things make me happy. - Like what? Killing Polliver, killing Rorge. So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it? At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over. Aye, nothing in the world beats that look. You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him? I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison-- poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel. That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to. I'd pay good money to see that. You should have let me burn it. It's a fleabite. That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to. Well, we won't have to walk too much further. You really think my aunt will pay for me? Aye, she'll pay. I've never even met her. Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about. I'm not a lady. Who would pass the Bloody Gate? The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn. Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago. I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. - I'm afraid to leave. - You shouldn't be. The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside. It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale. Shall we go? Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer? Soon. Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right? I've never seen him fight. Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die. Oberyn believes in himself. That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? - Breaking at the wheel? - Beheading. Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word. Cousins. Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister? Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. - Left him simple. - Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock. Nothing made him happier. Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted. On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else. The joke wore thin, though. For you. You drifted away. I had other interests. Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson. Why? I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\" He gave me an answer. \"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em.\" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library. Volarik. Tried to touch me once. Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason. Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles? I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once. He was twice your size. He just pushed me aside with a \"kuuh\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about? I don't know. Good luck today. Looks like very light armor. I like to move around. You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight. You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight. It could get you killed. It could get me killed. Today is not the day I die. You're going to fight that? I'm going to kill that. He is the biggest man I've ever seen. Size does not matter when you are flat on your back. Thank the gods. In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand - - of our champion-- Don't leave me alone in this world. Never. Have they told you who I am? Some dead man. I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you. I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick. Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children. You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children! Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it! Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this! The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.", "summary": ["Plot Mole's Town receives some unexpected visitors. Littlefinger's motives are questioned. Ramsay attempts to prove himself to his father. Tyrion's fate is decided.  Summary In the North Ramsay Snow sends Reek, forced to reassume his former identity of Theon Greyjoy, to treat with the ironborn garrison holding the northern fortress of Moat Cailin, barring the armies of House Bolton from returning to the North. Theon rides into the fortress to find corpses lying everywhere from constant attacks, and disease is running rampant; the ironborn remaining are sick, under-equipped and outnumbered. The garrison commander, Ralf Kenning, rebuffs the offer made by Ramsay of safe passage in exchange for surrender, and clearly thinks Theon to be an imposter, but he is cut down by one of his men, who accepts it on behalf of the soldiers. The ironborn surrender to Ramsay, but he has them killed and flayed regardless.  Roose and Ramsay confer Ramsay reports his success at Moat Cailin to his father.  In the aftermath, Ramsay meets with his father and presents him with the Greyjoy banner that was flying over the fortress. In recognition, Roose presents Ramsay with a decree of legitimization, making him officially a member of House Bolton. Delighted at the knowledge he will succeed his father as Warden of the North, Ramsay and Reek accompany Roose's army as it approaches its final destination: the ruins of Winterfell.   In Mole's Town, a whore is arguing with Gilly about her baby who woke her up during the night. Meanwhile, wildlings, including Tormund, Styr and Ygritte, attack the town, killing everyone in their path. Ygritte discovers Gilly hiding with her baby, but urges them to keep quiet, sparing their lives.  At the Wall News from M\u200bole's Town has arrived at Castle Black, where Sam worries about Gilly, blaming himself for bringing her to the town instead of keeping her with him at Castle Black. Grenn is angry at them cowering in the castle instead of helping their brothers in neighboring towns. Jon Snow says they can't go out to fight against the wildlings, as that is exactly what they want. Pypar and Edd try to comfort Sam by saying she might be alive and hiding, as she has survived worse situations, such as living with Craster, making a long march to the Wall, and even surviving a White Walker. This gives Sam hope that Gilly and her baby may have survived. Jon notes they have a bigger problem; if Mole's Town has been destroyed, Castle Black is next, and the few black brothers who remain are outnumbered a thousand to one by Mance Rayder's army. Edd notes that if the wildlings don't kill them all, there is even worse behind them that will finish the job, and asks whichever last man of the group is still alive at the end to burn the others, as he doesn't want to come back after he is dead.  In Meereen As Grey Worm is swimming with some other Unsullied outside Meereen, he notices Missandei and a number of other women bathing naked downstream. She spots him looking at her and returns his gaze, standing up slowly for him to see her before finally covering herself. Later Daenerys asks whether Missandei thinks he was spying on her. She says no, and Daenerys mentions that Dothraki have no taboos against nudity or public love-making. Of course, Missandei is not Dothraki, but she says it doesn't matter, as Grey Worm isn't interested in her \u2013 none of the Unsullied desire women. Missandei says he was interested though, surprisingly to both of them. Daenerys inquires whether, when a slave is castrated, the masters take \"all of it\"; both the \"pillar\" and the \"stones.\" Missandei says she doesn't know, to which Daenerys asks if she's ever wondered. Thoughtful, Missandei confirms that she has.  In Dany's audience chamber, Grey Worm comes to apologize to Missandei, but she tells him he doesn't need to. He hopes he didn't frighten her, and she says he did not. Addressing her in the Common Tongue, he tells her the lessons she gives are precious to him. Gently correcting his vocabulary, she notes that she doesn't remember teaching him the word \"precious.\" Grey Worm tells her that Jorah taught it to him. She asks whether he remembers his birth name, and Grey Worm says he remembers nothing. She asks if he remembers when they cut him, and he shakes his head \"no.\" She tells him she's sorry they did that to him, and when Grey Worm asks her why, she says it's a terrible thing to do to a boy. Grey Worm counters that, had the masters not cut him, he never would have been Unsullied, he never would have been freed, chosen to lead them, and met her. Missandei is visibly moved by this. Grey Worm apologizes once again, and she stops him while he turns to leave, telling him she is glad he saw her. He tells her he's glad as well.   Jorah leaves meeren Ser Jorah leaves Meereen.  As Ser Barristan Selmy watches the Unsullied taking the bodies of the crucified masters down outside Meereen, a small boy approaches him, giving him a scroll bearing the seal of the Hand. He reads its contents slowly in consternation. He confronts Ser Jorah: the document is a royal pardon signed by King Robert Baratheon. Barristan surmises Jorah spied on Daenerys in exchange for the pardon. Jorah begs to be allowed to speak with her privately, but Barristan tells him that he will never be alone with her again. In an audience before her, a seething Daenerys demands an explanation, and Jorah says it is a ploy by Tywin Lannister to divide them. Dany counters that the pardon was signed the year they met. Asking him whether he claims the pardon was forged, Jorah admits that it was not. He soon confesses to giving Varys information on Daenerys' activities in Essos. Daenerys angrily says that his telling them of her pregnancy by Khal Drogo led to her near-poisoning at the hands of a wine merchant. Jorah then protests that his actions stopped her from being poisoned, but Daenerys retorts this was only because he knew it might be coming. Jorah begs for her forgiveness, but Daenerys rebuffs him, saying he betrayed her, selling her secrets to the man she holds responsible for the death of her family. She spares his life, however, and gives him a day to leave Meereen. She warns that if he is seen in the city after that, his head will be thrown into Slaver's Bay. Jorah is last seen riding from Meereen on a horse.  In the Vale of Arryn Littlefinger-the-vale-640x502 Anya Waynwood with Yohn Royce and Vance Corbray as they question Petyr Baelish.  Petyr Baelish is testifying before a tribunal consisting of Lord Yohn Royce, Lady Anya Waynwood, and Ser Vance Corbray. The lords are suspicious of Lysa Arryn's death, which occured so soon after her marriage. Baelish has been attempting to spin the death as a suicide, but the lords don't believe him, given Lysa's devotion to her son. They rebuff Littlefinger's explanations in favor of speaking with the only other witness: his \"niece,\" Alayne. After confirming that Baelish can stay for her testimony, Sansa reveals her true identity and relates the tale of her captivity and escape from King's Landing. She continues, truthfully telling of Lysa's mental instability, jealousy and death, changing only a few details (saying Littlefinger only kissed her on the cheek and Lysa threw herself through the Moon Door). Sansa breaks down in tears and the lords are convinced, but while none of them are looking, she gives Littlefinger a stone-faced look.  Sansa&#039;s new clothes Sansa presents her new wardrobe to Littlefinger.  Later, Baelish visits Sansa and asks why she lied on his behalf. Sansa explains that she has no idea what Royce, Corbray, and Waynwood would want from her if he were eliminated, but that she does know what it is he wants. Littlefinger seems impressed that she made such a calculating decision, but attempts to cast doubt on her certainty, by asking if she really knows what he wants. Later on, as Littlefinger and Robin prepare to depart on a tour of the Vale, a raven-haired Sansa accompanies them, in a feathered black dress with a plunging neckline.  At some point, before or after this event, Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark arrive at the Bloody Gate of the Eyrie  and are informed of Lysa's death by Ser Donnel Waynwood. The Hound stares in shock, while Arya begins laughing due to the irony.  At King's Landing In the last hours before his trial by combat, Tyrion and Jaime share a final drink in Tyrion's cell and reminisce about Orson Lannister, their simple-minded cousin who spent his days smashing beetles with a rock. Tyrion tells Jaime of how he used to observe Orson day after day in an attempt to understand his motives, but in the end he was never able to come to reach any understanding. Tyrion asks Jaime if he thinks Oberyn stands a chance, but Jaime is not optimistic. As a bell rings out to announce daybreak in the city, Jaime takes his leave, wishing his brother luck.  Lannister guardsmen escort Tyrion to the arena, where a large crowd has assembled. He grows apprehensive to find a helm-less Oberyn drinking, and wearing very light armor \u2013 in comparison to his opponent, Ser Gregor Clegane, clad from head to foot in heavy armor and wielding a greatsword. Oberyn dismisses Tyrion's concerns, noting that he always drinks before a fight and favors speed over protection. As Gregor and his squire make their way to the arena, Ellaria becomes concerned, noting that The Mountain is the biggest man she's ever seen, but Oberyn remains confident that he will emerge triumphant. Grand Maester Pycelle steps into the arena and begins making a long-winded speech asking the gods to favor the innocent before Tywin Lannister cuts him short and begins the trial by combat.  The Viper vs the Mountain3 Oberyn fights against the Mountain in the trial by combat.  Oberyn, after impressing the crowd with a display of acrobatic spear maneuvers, goes on the attack, stabbing out at Gregor and constantly moving out of the knight's reach, forcing Gregor to tire himself out chasing his opponent. As he evades Gregor, Oberyn repeatedly taunts Gregor by constantly bringing up his part in the murder of his sister, Elia Martell, and her children, and demanding a confession, only enraging Clegane further. As the fight progresses, Oberyn manages to seriously injure Gregor, stabbing him first in the chest, severing his Achilles Tendon and then burying his spear in Gregor's stomach, pinning him to the floor. As Jaime and Tyrion exchange a relieved grin across the arena, a furious Oberyn circles the prone Gregor, demanding that before he dies, Gregor confess to murdering Elia and her children, raping Elia, and that it was Tywin who gave the order.  However, Oberyn stands too close to his seemingly defeated opponent, and Gregor manages to trip and seize him. Berserk with fury, Gregor grabs Oberyn by the throat and lifts him off the ground, smashing out most of his teeth with a single devastating punch. Climbing on top of Oberyn, Gregor finally admits for all to hear that he raped and killed Elia as he gouges out Oberyn's eyes with his thumbs before crushing the Viper's skull between his hands, which he proclaims having done the same to his sister. As Ellaria screams in horror, a stunned silence sweeps over the crowd. The short joyful moments for Tyrion and Jaime are shattered, as Tywin stands and proclaims the will of the gods is clear: Tyrion is guilty and sentenced to death. Tyrion cannot even reply, shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at Oberyn's skull-crushed corpse, as does Jaime; the only different reaction is from Cersei, who stares at Oberyn's slaughtered body, listening to Tyrion's death sentence while smirking in vindication.

She she had red hair. Oh? - How big were her feet? - What do you want me to say? I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to knowing. So you and Gilly never? No. She just had a baby. And she never offered. But if she had, you would have? You'd have broken your vows? The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women. What? \"I shall take no wife,\" yes, that's in there. There's no denying that. \"I shall father no children.\" It's very specific. But what do our vows have to say about other activities is open to interpretation. I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation. Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like? It's there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you. And you-- for a little-- for a little while, you're more than just you. You're-- I don't know. I'm not a bleeding poet. No, you're really not. What did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart. There'll be arrows for all of us soon, I imagine. There will. They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do. Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch. Did I ever tell you about her? - My Sheila? - Yes. That was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink. Her fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many is the man who-- I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't want to think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a crow's heart. We could be waiting here a while. Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. They came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs. Then they started hunting us down. This time, we're the ones doing the hunting. You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows. Back in those villages, I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon. Yes, but none of those were your crow lover. I probably killed him already. So you've said. And if not, the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around my neck. More words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge. You been thinking about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like? Maybe I have. Jon Snow is mine. Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me. And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly? Maester Aemon. - How did you know-- - That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night? - Let me help you. - Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question. What are you reading? Maester Faull. Ah, the wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a wildling was this very library. But what he says about what they do, it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report. Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us. Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall to come here and read about the terrible things that may have happened to the girl you love. I don't love her. - Yes, you do. - No. Yes, you do. Heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds. I was in love once. You were? You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child. Is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you? I'm sorry, Maester. I didn't mean it like that. Do you know who I was before I came here? What I could have been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young. Who was she? Ah. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was, how we met, the color of her eyes, and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed, Tarly. Sorry, I can't open the gate for anybody. Orders. You don't understand. They killed everyone. Everyone but me and my baby. They're out there. I saw them on my way here. They may have seen me. They may have followed me. Please. I'm sorry, I can't. If they find us out here, you don't know Pyp! Open the gate. - I can't. - Sam, is that you? Yes. Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate. Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate! I never heard you curse before. Yes, well, best get used to it. Are you all right? Shh, you're all right. Of course you are, my brave little fella. - It was horrible. - I'm so, so sorry. I didn't know until I got back. Don't let them send me away, Sam. - Never. - I know there's no women allowed. Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go, too. Get ready! - Man the gate! - Ready yourselves! Make haste! - Prepare! - Up on the Wall! Quickly! Up! Up! How many? How many are there? Beyond the trees! It's time. Light them up! Light them all! Move! Pick up the pace! Come on, come on. Here we go, boys, there's one. Let's go. There's two. Let's get the next load. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser. Yes, Ser. You can say it if you like. We should have sealed the tunnel while we had the chance, like you suggested. It was a difficult decision either way, Ser. Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end-- for him, for the clever little twats, for everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your wildling whore had finished the job. You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can. You're leaving me again? I'm not leaving you. You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together. I didn't mean in the same room. What are you going to do out there? - Help my brothers. - How? You're going to fight the free folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Mole's Town, they killed everyone. I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there. Why not? You won't matter up there. You will down here. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend the Wall and I have to keep it because that's what men do. Promise me you won't die. I promise you I won't die. There's a lot more wildlings on the other side of the Wall than this side. We've got loads of weapons and things. It's the perfect place for us to be. I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. This is no place for me to be. You're not afraid? Of course I'm afraid. There's a band of wildlings coming to kill us. If you're afraid of a band of wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a white walker? I didn't know I was going to kill it. But I had to do something. I didn't have any choice. It was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid. But you're afraid now? Yes, well I'm not nothing anymore. Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than 20 down here. Leftovers. They got a big fat one and a little bony one manning the front. How high are the walls? Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened. Let's kill some crows! Come on! Come on, brothers! Archers nock. Everyone else hold. Grenn, no! I said nock and hold, you cunts! - Does nock mean draw? - No, Ser! - Does fucking hold mean fucking drop? - No, Ser! - You all plan to die here tonight? - No, Ser! That's very good to hear. Draw! No, down below! Draw! Light them up. Come on, get up! They're attacking the southern gate! - Now? - Now. I'm going down there. Brother Slynt, you have the Wall. What? What are you fucking waiting for? Loose! You heard the man. Loose! You, over there. - Did you get one? - No. Ah, shit, Pyp! Shit. - Sam. - Yeah? I think we're gonna die. If you keep missing, we will. Come on! Come on! Brothers! have defended this castle. She's never fallen before. She will not fall tonight. Those are Thenns at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight? No! Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises, I promise you, Castle Black will stand! The Night's Watch will stand. With me now! Now with me! No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders. We can't just let them attack the gate! The bars of those gates are four inches of cold-rolled steel. Those are giants riding mammoths down there! Do you think your cold-rolled steel is gonna stop them? No such thing as giants. A story for the children. Brother Slynt. We just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, Ser, and he needs you. Needed below? Yes. Yes. Archers, nock your arrows! Nock arrows! Draw! Loose! They won't summit before dawn. How do you know that? Because I've made that climb. I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were. Hold the bridge! Hold, wait for it! Come on with the rocks! Nock! Draw! Loose! Down! No! No! To the gate. Come on, let's move. It's gonna open. I got one right through the heart. He's dead. - Oh, is it over? - No. Well, then You're all right. You're all right. I'll get help. Shh. Shh. Maester Aemon is coming. He's gonna make it all right. Shh. Shh. - Now. - Now! The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate. Aye. Hold the gate. If they make it through They won't. Come on, Hill. And you, Cooper. You three, on me. Come on, you lazy bastards. Oil. Oil on the ramp! Protect the gate! Get him inside. Hold the fucking gate! Hold it! We need more men down here. - We have to hold the gate. - But we need men here. Tell Jon. He's in command. Let's go. Get me to the top! You hear me?! Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me, Olly. Get me to the top. And when we give the signal, bring us back down. You hear me? Find a weapon, Olly. Fight them. Clear the way! Let's go! - Out of the way! - Get out of here! Cut the rope! Wait! No! - We need more archers. - Here I am. - Come on. - Quickly. What are you doing up here? The wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser's fallen. The castle won't stand much longer. Edd, you have the Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them. Come, brothers. Now fight with me! Might as well enjoy our last night, right, boys? Light the fuckers up! Nock! Draw! Loose! How are we gonna stop that? Shot 20 arrows in him already. You heard Jon. We hold the gate. Jon Snow's not Lord Commander. We hold the gate! Mother, save me. Father, save me. The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us. You hear me? Night gathers and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crown and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch for this night and all the nights to come! I don't want you out there. You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls. I need him more than I need you. We need you, boy. Ha! Jon Snow. Hush. Don't talk. Do you remember the cave? We should have stayed in the cave. We'll go back there. You know nothing, Jon Snow. Drop the scythe, boys! - Hoist her up. - Hoist her up! They've had enough for one night. Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us Tormund. It's over. Let it end. This is how a man ends. Put him in chains. We'll question him later. I should have thrown you from the top of the Wall, boy! Aye. You should have. Whoa, it's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I? We held them off. For one night. This is a great victory. A great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants. He has more mammoths. He has 1,000 times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we'll never beat them. Where are we going? Going to find Mance. To fi--- you can't do that. No one gave you any orders. Who's left to give orders? The wildling army's only an army because of Mance. He united Without Mance, they lose their leader. They lose their purpose. They go back to fighting each other. Scatter back to their homes. Without Mance? You're going to kill him? I'm gonna try. They'll never let you within 100 yards of him. And even if they did, even if you managed to kill him-- They'll kill me? If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us, too. They won't just kill you. They'll boil you. They'll flay you. They'll make it last days. You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan? They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. We need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate. Then lower it again as soon as I'm out. What are you doing? I promised Mormont I'd never lose it again. In case I don't come back. Jon. Come back.", "summary": ["Plot Jon Snow and the rest of the Night's Watch face the biggest challenge to the Wall yet.  Summary S04E09 - Jon &amp; Sam (On the Wall) Jon and Sam patrol the Wall.  At the Wall \u200b\u200bJon and Sam are standing watch atop the Wall, staring out into the darkness of the north and awaiting the imminent wildling invasion. Sam attempts to interrogate Jon about what it was like to be with a woman, stating that as their deaths are looming, it may be his last chance to find out. Sam brings up that the vows of the Night's Watch only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing children, and that other \"activities\" are open to interpretation. Jon replies glumly that Alliser Thorne most likely does not care about their interpretations. When further pressed by Sam to describe lying down with Ygritte, Jon attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it, proclaiming exasperatedly that he's \"not a bleeding poet.\"  Jon offers to take the watch up alone so Sam can go below. As Sam steps into the wooden lift and begins to descend the Wall, an owl lands on top of the wall and begins hooting loudly. The owl is revealed to be controlled by a Thenn warg who is a member of the garrison of wildlings under command of Tormund and Styr, who have set up camp just outside of the southern entrance to Castle Black. Tormund boasts about a bear he supposedly had sex with, prompting Ygritte to cut him short and cast her doubts on the validity of his claim. She tells him that she only cares about getting as many arrows through the hearts of \"crows\" as possible. She angrily talks about how the people south of the Wall have used it to shut the the wildlings out and hunt them as enemies. She says that now the wildlings are the hunters and the southerners their prey. Styr mockingly replies that Ygritte has more words about killing than she has arrows. She defends herself by saying she killed just as many people at Mole's Town as he, but Styr replies that none of them was her former lover. He further mocks her by saying that when she sees him, she'll likely just serve him a slice of \"ginger minge,\" causing her to jump to her feet in anger. Ygritte stares Styr down, claiming that she wants to kill Jon Snow herself, then looks around the camp and warns the others that she has an arrow ready for anyone else who attempts to kill him. Just outside the camp, a shaded person cradling something passes by the wildlings unnoticed.  Aemon in library Maester Aemon finds Sam in the Castle Black library.  \u200bMeanwhile, Sam is caught reading a book about wildlings by Maester Aemon. Aemon correctly guesses that Sam is reading the book because he wants to know what kind of fate might have befallen Gilly if she fell into wildling hands during the sack of Mole's Town. He also surmises that Sam has shown such a keen interest in her fate because he is in love with her, despite Sam's protests to the contrary. Aemon muses about the girl he once loved, stating that he can still picture her as clear as day and that she is more real than Sam is. After being dismissed by Aemon, Sam leaves the maester's chambers only to hear Gilly at the gate begging to be allowed inside, revealing her survival of the Mole's Town massacre and her identity as the cloaked figure approaching Castle Black. Pypar attempts to deny her passage into the castle, saying he is not allowed to open the gate under any circumstances. However, Sam roars at Pyp to allow her in, causing Pyp to relent and let her in. Sam promises Gilly wherever she goes next he will go too, but their reunion is cut short by two blows from the horn, indicating that Mance's wildling army has finally begun their assault. Sam rushes to get Gilly safely inside the castle while other brothers of the Night's Watch prepare for the impending attack by wildlings. S04E09 - Jon (On the Wall) Jon looking off the top of the Wall.  On top of the Wall, Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north, witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the North, just as Mance had promised. South of the Wall, the Thenn warg's owl also spots the fire and informs Styr and Tormund that the time has come to attack Castle Black. Jon approaches Ser Alliser Thorne, who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded Jon's advice and blocked the gates. He grimly muses that leadership often means being second-guessed by \"every clever little twat with a mouth\" and when a man in charge second-guesses himself, all is doomed. Steeling himself for the impending siege, Thorne begins barking orders to the archers, preparing them to fire upon the attackers massing below.  Gilly and sam kiss Sam and Gilly share a kiss.  Sam brings Gilly\u200b and her baby to a storage room where she can hide. Gilly wants Sam to stay with her as he promised, but he cannot as he swore to defend the Wall as a brother of the Night's Watch. Before he leaves her, Gilly begs Sam to promise her that he won't die and the two finally share a kiss. As Sam and Pypar are preparing arrows at the southern gate, Pypar laments that he has never seen a real battle before or ever even held an edged blade. Pyp asks how Sam is not afraid, but Sam replies that he is, as there are thousands of wildlings about to overrun them. Pyp asks how he managed to kill a White Walker while being afraid, and Sam says that at that moment, he just had to do something or Gilly would have been killed and her baby would have been taken. Sam further explains that at that moment, he wasn't himself; he was nothing, and when you are nothing there is nothing to be afraid of. However, he explains the reason he is afraid now is because \"I'm not nothing anymore.\" Battle of Castle Black begins Mance's army charges at the Wall.  Meanwhile, Ygritte spies on the Castle to scout numbers of defenders. She tells the other wildlings that most of the guards are at the top of the Wall and that few are left in the Castle. The group immediately take off towards Castle Black's southern gate, while Ygritte seems to have second thoughts. North of the Wall, the massive wildling army emerges from the woods, their numbers including giants riding atop mammoths. Alliser orders the archers on the Wall to nock their arrows, but they draw instead while Grenn accidentally drops a barrel down the Wall. Alliser angrily drills his men on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at Castle Black, signalling the unanticipated appearance of Tormund's band of wildlings at the castle's southern entrance. Realizing the dire need for experienced men to defend the keep from the surprise attack, Alliser orders Janos Slynt to assume command of the Wall's defenses and heads below to join the melee.  Below, Tormund and Styr's forces charge the gate while Ygritte, acting as a sniper, manages to pick off several men defending the gate with her bow. Pyp is firing a crossbow as Sam assists by reloading another crossbow, but Pyp's aim is poor due to inexperience and nerves so he repeatedly misses his shots. The band of wildlings manage to reach Castle Black's walls and begin scaling them using grappling hooks and ropes, forcing Sam and Pyp to retreat.  Alliser Thorne arrives with reinforcements from the top of the Wall via the wooden lift system, which is being operated by Olly. Alliser gives an impassioned speech, promising that the ancient order of the Night's Watch and Castle Black will survive this battle. His speech rallies the black brothers and Alliser personally leads the charge against the wildlings who have breached Castle Black's defenses, causing an intense battle to erupt in the courtyard.  Mammth A giant rides a mammoth.  \u200b\u200bOn the northern side of the Wall, a wildling strike force led by two giants (one of which is riding a mammoth) charge towards Castle Black's outer gate. On top of the Wall, Janos Slynt, having no true leadership experience, breaks down at the sight of the massive wildling army and begins fumbling his orders. Grenn steps in by falsely claiming that Alliser needs Janos back down below. Janos believes the lie and leaves, allowing Jon to take command of the Wall's defenses. The black brothers continue to rain down arrows on the advancing wildlings, even killing ones that are attempting to scale the Wall. One giant, armed with a massive bow, manages to fire a huge arrow at one of the bunkers atop the Wall, completely obliterating it and killing the black brother manning it. The force of the giant's arrow carries the black brother off the wall on to the other side where he is shoved into ground with a tremendous amount of force. Hobb&#039;s Butcher&#039;s Knife Hobb takes up his butcher's knife to defend the dining hall.  Down in Castle Black, the battle rages on between the wildlings and the Night's Watch. Styr and Ygritte continue to slay numerous black brothers. At one point, a group of wildlings breach Castle Black's dining hall. One wildling is killed when a black brother throws boiling stew in his face and beats him to death with the pot. Hobb, Castle Black's cook, calmly enters the dining hall and kills a wildling with his massive butcher's knife. Meanwhile, Janos Slynt cowardly retreats to a storage room where he discovers Gilly and her baby.  S04E09 - Pypar&#039;s death Samwell Tarly comforts Pypar as he dies.  Pyp\u200b manages to kill a wildling with his crossbow, but is then shot through the neck by Ygritte. Sam comforts Pyp and stays with him until he dies. Sam is forced to leave Pyp's body and as he heads to Castle Black's lift system, but he is spotted by the Thenn warg. The warg charges at Sam as he desperately attempts to load his crossbow, managing to do so and firing a bolt into the warg's head just before he reaches him. Meanwhile, Alliser Thorne is locked in a vicious duel with Tormund on the catwalks of Castle Black, both seem evenly matched in skill. However, Thorne suffers a grievous wound and is forced to retreat, being dragged to safety as he continues to shout orders to his men.  Mag charges Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg charges Castle Black's inner gate.  The black brothers defending the Wall manage to repel most of the wildlings attacking the outer gate, but one giant manages to make it through, greatly weakening the gate by repeatedly smashing it with his fists and managing to singlehandedly begin lifting the gate. Jon, knowing the inner gate won't hold against the massive giant, sends a group of black brothers led by Grenn to hold it at any cost. Arriving at the inner gate, Hill cowers when faced by the giant charging at them, but Grenn bolsters his and the others courage by reciting the Night's Watch oath. The black brothers ready their weapons just as the giant slams himself into the inner gate.  Battle of Castle Black Jon fights with Styr.  Sam arrives atop the Wall to ask Jon for more men to defend the castle, and Jon tasks Sam with releasing Ghost from his pen to assist in the fighting. Jon descends the Wall and finally enters the fray, quickly dispatching several wildlings and catching the attention of Styr. The two meet in a single combat where Styr eventually gets the upper hand by knocking Longclaw away and brutally assaulting Jon, smashing his face into an anvil and tossing him into the blacksmith's forge. Styr picks Jon up and begins strangling him, but Jon spits blood in Styr's face and distracts him long enough for Jon to grab the blacksmith's hammer lying next to him and buries it in Styr's skull.  Ygritte dies Jon holds a dying Ygritte.  Upon killing Styr, Jon turns around to find Ygritte pointing her bow at him with an arrow drawn. He smiles at her, causing Ygritte to hesitate. Before either can say anything, Ygritte is shot near the heart by an arrow fired from Olly, avenging the death of his father at Ygritte's hands during the wildling attack on his village. Jon holds her in his arms as she tells him that they should have never left the cave, and they lament circumstances that prevented them from being together as she succumbs to her wound.  Tormund capture Tormund makes a last stand before he is subdued by Jon and the Night's Watch.  Atop the Wall, Eddison Tollett, who Jon left in command of the defenses, orders the men to drop the 'scythe.' A huge section of ice suddenly falls away from the wall revealing a massive anchor-like blade attached to a chain that swings along the Wall, mowing through the wildlings attempting to climb its face. Eddison notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the Haunted Forest, proclaiming that they have stopped them for now, but that the wildlings still outnumber the black brothers 1,000 to 1 and that Mance was simply testing their defenses. Below, a heavily wounded Tormund is surrounded in the courtyard but continues to fight despite being the only wildling alive in Castle Black. He is finally subdued by Jon with a crossbow and taken prisoner by the Night's Watch for interrogation. Sam returns to Gilly just like he promised and discovers Janos Slynt, who hid in fear during the entire battle. Against all odds, the Night's Watch have repelled Mance Rayder's forces for the time being. The following morning, what is left of Castle Black's garrison begin to regroup and prepare for the inevitable next attack by Mance Rayder. Jon discusses with Sam that he has a suicidal solution to end the wildling threat; he plans to assassinate Mance Rayder, noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the army, and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership. Sam tries to talk sense into Jon, but to no avail. As Jon prepares to leave via Castle Black's tunnel, they discover the bodies of the black brothers who held the inner gate against the giant. Grenn is among the casualties and Jon tells Sam that all of the bodies must be burned. Before Jon leaves, he remembers the promise he made to Jeor Mormont and decides to leave Longclaw with Sam. Sam tells Jon to come back, and Jon looks at Sam and smiles dolefully before stepping out into the wilderness on the other side of the gate."], "review": null}, "39": {"id": "s04e10", "name": "The Children", "script": "You're wearing a black cloak again. I've been sent to negotiate with you. It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow. Truly I was. The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal to him and to my Night's Watch vows. All your vows? She wasn't enough to turn you, eh? Were you enough to turn her? She put three arrows in me when I escaped. Did you see her again at Castle Black? - Yes. - And? She's dead. - Your doing? - No. We'll drink to her. Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last. - Ygritte. - Ygritte. That's not wine. No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty. He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn. He was their king. The last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men. Grenn came from a farm. - Mag and Grenn. - Grenn and Mag. Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything for quite some time. So, you're here to strike a bargain? Turn your army around and go home. You know I know you're low on arrows, you're low on oil, you're low on men. How many are left, 50? I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than 1,000 men. I showed you everything I had. The whole army, And what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. As soon as I saw that, I sent 400 men to climb the Wall, an unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer. We're here to hide behind your Wall. Just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming. And if my people aren't south of the Wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. You want to strike a bargain with me? Here's the bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us, and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse, and we'll kill every last man at Castle Black. Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you. They'd kill you, of course. They'd kill you slow. But you knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered you peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are? Riders coming! - Are you attacking us? - No. It's like you said, we don't have the men. Hold! To me! To me! Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it. Round them up. Stay with the horses. You're the King-beyond-the-Wall? - Do you know who I am? - Never had the pleasure. This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms. We're not in the Seven Kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather. It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king. We do not kneel. I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king. All the same, we do not kneel. Take these men away. What's a man of the Night's Watch doing in a wildling camp? I was sent to discuss terms with the King-beyond-the-Wall. You're speaking to the one true king, boy. You will address him as Your Grace. I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace. I'm Ned Stark's son. Your father was an honorable man. He was, Your Grace. What do you think he'd have done with him? I was this man's prisoner once. He could have tortured me. He could have killed me. But he spared my life. I think my father would have taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say. Very well, then. Take him. Your Grace. If my father had seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them. I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate. Bloody Martells. The cause appears to be manticore venom. It is. The Death's Head manticore. Yes, I've read a great deal about it. It's a horrible poison. Usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done. Yes, there is. May I ask what you think you're doing? Saving him. Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a maester, let alone Grand Maester. That's for the best. No maester knows how to save him. That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so, in my opinion. You're dismissed, Grand Maester. But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory. - Not anymore. - But I-- - You can save him? - Difficult to say, Your Grace. But if my past work is any guide we stand a chance. Do everything you can. Come to me for anything you need. Thank you, Your Grace. You should know, the process may change him somewhat. Will it weaken him? Oh, no. Very well, then. Not another word. We've been over this. The matter's closed. I'm opening it again. You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell. You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell. And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery. I will not. Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was. I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son the king. When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances. And if you recall-- I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times. Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will? When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle of Blackwater-- do you remember? I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade. That's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away. - No. - Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy. My last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in, you will dig your claws in and you'll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen. And how will you do that? I'll tell everyone the truth. What truth would that be? You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying? Of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past 20 years, one real look at your own children and you would have known. Known what? Everything they say is true. - About Jaime and me. - No. - Your legacy is a lie. - No, no, no, no. I don't believe you. Yes, you do. Jaime. You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there? For my family, no, nothing. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine. - Tyrion is your family. - He's not. - You don't get to choose. - I do. So do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-- Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant. A disease doesn't decide to kill you. All the same, you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose? The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-- I choose you. - Those are words. - Yes. Like the ones I just said to Father. I told him. Told him what? I told him about us. You told him? I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you. You think he'll just accept that? Go and ask him. What did you say? I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister. I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small, I can't even see them. I only see what matters. Someone will walk in. I don't care. I can speak the common tongue if you wish. You speak it very well. Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much. I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you? When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets. I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them. I do not mean to offend, Your Grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist. My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order, my friend, this I promise you. Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of his children. What is it that you want from me? Your Grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal. You want to return to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair? Please, Your Grace. The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them, but for those of us too old to change, there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you. I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year. Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you. The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name. Approach, my friend. I have brought you-- He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and My girl. My little girl. What was her name? Zala, Your Grace. - How old was she? - Three. Three. They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again. And now their watch is ended. And now their watch is ended. Your old blind man patched me up. Why? He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe. You want me alive so you can torture me? No one's gonna torture you. So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the Wall? I don't know what happens to the prisoners. Who decides? I suppose Stannis does. He your king now? I don't have a king. You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again. We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them? Words? What kind of words? Funeral words. I don't know how the free folk do it. Do what? Say farewell. The dead can't hear us, boy. Snow. Did you love her? She loved you. She told you? No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me? We can stop. We can rest. We'll rest with the three-eyed raven. We're not going to make it. We're already here. Jojen. Jojen. Look, Jojen. Look. Jojen! Come on! Help them! Now! Hold on to me! Hang on! - Hodor. - Help them! Hodor. Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor! Bran! Save yourself, now! Come with me, Brandon Stark. He is lost. Come with me or die with him. Go with them. They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here. Who are you? The First Men called us the children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you. You're the three-eyed raven? I've been many things. Now I am what you see. My brother, he led us to you and now he-- He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew and he went anyway. How do you know? I've been watching you. All of you. All of your lives. With 1,000 eyes and one. Now you've come to me at last, Brandon Stark. Though the hour is late. I didn't want anyone to die for me. He died so you could find what you have lost. You're going to help me walk again? You will never walk again. But you will fly. Podrick. Podrick. Where are the horses? I hobbled them last night. What sort of hobble? A figure eight like you taught me. If you did it like I taught you, then the horses would be here. Thieves, maybe? It's at least 30 miles to the Eyrie from here. You're carrying the saddlebags. People coming. You can shit later. There's people coming. Morning. Morning. I like your sword. Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate? About 10 more miles. Did you hear that, Podrick? Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate. Are you a knight? No. But you know how to use that sword? I do. Does it have a name? Oathkeeper. Mine's Needle. Good name. Who taught you how to fight? My father. Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys. Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, \"If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right.\" Seven blessings. I'm Brienne of Tarth. This is Podrick Payne. You want something? That's Sandor Clegane. The Hound. You're Arya Stark. I asked if you wanted something. I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her. My mother's dead. I know. I wish I could have been there to protect her. You're not a northerner. No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her. Why didn't you? She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing. You're paid by the Lannisters. You're here for the bounty on me. I'm not paid by the Lannisters. No? Fancy sword you've got there. Where'd you get it? I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth. Tell me that's not Lannister gold. Jaime Lannister gave me this sword. The Bloody Gate is 10 miles. I swore to your mother by the old gods-- I don't care what you swore. - Arya! - You heard the girl. - She's not coming with you. - She is. You're not a good listener. That Valyrian steel? I always wanted some Valyrian steel. Come with me, Arya. I'll take you to safety. Safety? Where the fuck's that? Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead. Her mother's dead. Her father's dead. Her brother's dead. Winterfell is a pile of rubble. There is no safety, you dumb bitch. You don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her. And that's what you're doing? Watching over her? Aye, that's what I'm doing. I have no wish to kill you, Ser. I'm not a knight. Arya! Arya! Arya! - Where is she? - She was just here. Why weren't you watching her? I was watching you. I thought you might need some help. Which way, Pod? Which way did she go? I think that way. Arya! Arya! You still here? Big bitch saved you. I don't need saving. No, not you. You're a real killer. With your water dancing and your Needle. You gonna die? Unless there's a maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I'm done. I'd skin you alive for wine. Fuck water. Killed by a woman. I bet you like that. Go on, go after her. She'll help you. Going it alone, you won't last a day out there. I'll last longer than you. You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I'm ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher's boy. The ginger. He was begging for mercy. \"Please, Ser. Please don't kill me. Please, please.\" Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks. And your sister. Your pretty sister. I should have taken her. That night the Blackwater burned. I should have fucked her bloody. At least I'd have one happy memory. Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it. Do it. Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore. Is that any way to speak about our mother? What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? A galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities. - Who's helping you? - Varys. - Varys? - You have more friends than you thought. There's a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, then twice again. Varys will open. I suppose this is good-bye, then. Farewell, little brother. Jaime. Thank you for my life. Quickly now. Tywin? My lion. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Tyrion. Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Your brother, I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers. This is how you want to speak to me, hmm? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure. All my life you've wanted me dead. Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that. Even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you. Is that what you fear? I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son. I loved her. Who? Shae. Oh, Tyrion. - Put down that crossbow. - I murdered her. With my own hands. - It doesn't matter. - Doesn't matter? She was a whore. - Say that word again - And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Now, enough of this nonsense. I am your son and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. - Why? - Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity. I can't go back there. She's in there. You're afraid of a dead whore? You shot me. You're no son of mine. I am your son. I have always been your son. What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend. I brought you this far. I want to see the captain. You're seeing him. I want to go north to the Wall. No, you don't. I can pay. There is nothing in the North but ice and war and pirates. I wouldn't need a cabin. Please. I could work scrubbing the floors. I'm not going north, child. I'm going home. - Where's home? - The Free City of Braavos. Wait. I have something else. More silver won't make a difference. It's not silver. It's iron. This How did you-- Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin.", "summary": ["Plot An unexpected arrival north of the Wall changes circumstances. Dany is forced to face some harsh realities; her three dragons (Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion) are gone. Bran learns more of his destiny. Tyrion sees the truth of his situation.  Summary At the Wall, and Beyond Jon Snow emerges from the outer gate of the Wall and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous night's battle towards Mance Rayder's war camp. Jon eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by wildlings, who bring him before Mance. Mance notes that he is wearing the black of the Night's Watch again. He brings Jon inside his tent, and questions his status as a traitor. Jon confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by Qhorin Halfhand to get Jon to infiltrate Mance's army, and that Qhorin tricked Mance into trusting Jon by allowing Jon to kill Qhorin himself in a fight. Mance asks about Ygritte. Saddened, Jon reveals that she died at the Battle of Castle Black, though not by his hands. Mance somberly proposes that they drink a toast to her memory, and Jon agrees, but is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink. Jon accepts after Mance assures him that if he'd wanted to kill Jon, poison would be the last of his methods. They drink to Ygritte. Mance then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out, and Jon informs Mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend Grenn. Mance ruefully notes that the giant was named Mag the Mighty, and he was \"king\" of the giants, the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the First Men entered Westeros, to which Jon then glibly notes that his friend Grenn was from a farm. They have another toast to Mag and Grenn.  Jon then proposes his terms to Mance: turn his army around and return home. Mance immediately counters that the Night's Watch is low on oil, arrows, and men, and when he sent his full force against the Wall the Night's Watch threw everything they had at him to repel the attack. Mance guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding Castle Black, but Jon lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison. However, Mance calls Jon's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending Castle Black, he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the Wall, and they will attack Castle Black's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order. Mance then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands south of the Wall; that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the White Walkers just as those south of the Wall are. Mance then makes his counteroffer: if the Night's Watch will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the Wall, no more harm will come to the black brothers. However, if his terms are refused, his wildling army will slaughter every last member of the Night's Watch and move south by force.  Stannis attacks Stannis and his cavalry take Mance Rayder's wildling army unawares.  Mance then notices that Jon is eyeing a cooking knife, and quickly deduces that Jon came to parley with Mance simply so he could assassinate him. He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that Jon might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself, but that Jon must have known he would die assassinating Mance. Mance is shocked and questions Jon if this is what the Night's Watch has sunk to: killing a man who let him into his own tent, who offered him (relatively) reasonable peace terms. Jon hesitates, but before anyone can make a move, war horns are heard from outside. Mance's guards safely grab Jon during the distraction, and Mance demands to know if the Night's Watch is attacking them, but Jon admits that it's just as Mance said: the Night's Watch doesn't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the Wall and attack.  Columns of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of House Baratheon of Dragonstone, and are led by none other than Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth. The wildlings are caught in their own camp, resting from the battle the night before and only expecting attacks from the Wall, so their eastern flank is completely undefended. As they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry, they are quickly dispatched by Stannis' riders, who attack the wildling camp from both sides in two separate columns that catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment. Quickly cutting the wildling forces down, Stannis and Davos ride up to Mance, who throws down his weapons in surrender, officially ending the wildlings' siege of Castle Black.   Davos introduces Stannis as the true king of the Seven Kingdoms, but Mance wryly points out that they are not currently in the Seven Kingdoms. Stannis demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king. Resignedly, Mance says that the Free Folk do not kneel, knowing that Stannis will kill him if he does not. Davos, however, asks what a man of the Night's Watch is doing in the camp, and Jon explains that he came to treaty with the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Jon says that he knows that Stannis is the true king, as his own father died supporting his claim, revealing himself as the bastard son of Eddard Stark. This makes Stannis regard Jon more seriously. Stannis proclaims that Eddard was an honorable man, and asks Jon what Ned would have done with Mance. Jon responds that Mance could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life. Jon tells Stannis that his father would have taken Mance prisoner and listened to what he had to say. Before they leave the wildling camp, Jon also urges Stannis to burn the dead before nightfall.   All she sees is snow Melisandre looks through the flames, and sees Snow.  Back at Castle Black, a funeral is held for the slain members of the Night's Watch, who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the castle courtyard. Maester Aemon delivers a eulogy, saying that they died to protect the men, women, and children of the south who will never even know who they were, that it is the duty of the surviving black brothers to keep alive their memory. Aemon closes his speech with the customary line, \"and now their watch has ended,\" which is repeated by the gathered men. Samwell then aids Aemon in setting the pyre alight, which is continued by Jon and other men carrying torches. Stannis and Davos look on, along with Queen Selyse and Princess Shireen. Jon looks across the flames and catches the gaze of Melisandre, who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre. Melisandre seems intrigued, her piercing stare clearly making Jon uneasy.  S04E10 - Burial of Ygritte Jon gives Ygritte a northern burial beyond the Wall, at the request of Tormund.  Afterwards, Jon enters the chamber of the castle where Tormund is being held. Tormund asks why blind old Maester Aemon patched up his arrow wounds, and Jon says that Aemon is sworn to heal all wounded men, friend or foe. Tormund asks if Jon really loved Ygritte, telling Jon that Ygritte truly loved him. Jon asks if Ygritte told Tormund this but Tormund says no, he knew Ygritte loved him because all she ever talked about was killing him. Saddened, Tormund implores Jon that Ygritte's final resting place should be in \"the real north.\" Jon then takes Ygritte's corpse to the north side of the Wall and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred Heart tree. Jon looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre, and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads home.  Wights rise Wights rise from the ground to kill Bran and company.   Far to the north, Bran Stark and the Reed children continue their journey to find the Three-Eyed Raven, though they are on the brink of exhaustion. Jojen Reed has grown sick and he is barely able to stand, eventually collapsing into the snow. As Meera begs Jojen to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward, Bran calls out to them, revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that Bran has seen in his visions. As they approach the tree, wights burst up from the snow, grabbing Jojen's ankles and attempting to drag him under the ice. These wights appear far older than those seen near the Wall, appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility. Meera attempts to defend Jojen from the wights, but they begin to swarm over Hodor, who is too scared to fight back. Bran wargs into Hodor's mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf Summer, but more wights keep bursting through the ice and they are quickly overwhelmed.  Just as all seems lost, the wights around Bran suddenly burst into fireballs, and he hears a young girl's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree. Amidst the confusion, Jojen is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before Meera can fight it off. The mysterious girl calls to Meera and says that Jojen is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live. Meera hesitates, but Jojen urges her to save herself. Crying, Meera slits her brother's throat to grant him the mercy of a quick death. Meera runs to the cave entrance along with Bran, Hodor, and Summer while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights. Just as the life drains from Jojen's eyes, she launches a fireball at his body, immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight.  They run into the cave, pursued by the wights, who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave. The little girl explains that the power which animates the dead corpses is powerless inside the cave. When Bran asks who she is, she replies that \"the First Men called us 'the Children, but we were born long before them.\" Bran realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the Children of the Forest, the original, non-human inhabitants of Westeros who carved the faces into weirwood trees and taught the First Men to worship the Old Gods thousands of years ago.  Game-of-thrones-season-4-finale-tree-man Bran meets the Three-Eyed Raven in his real form.  The child leads them deeper into the cave, which is overgrown with white weirwood roots from the massive tree above. Other Children of the Forest peek out around corners as they advance. Finally, they arrive at a large central chamber, its floor littered with bones. In the middle of the cave is an old man seated in the middle of weirwood roots, which have grown around and even through much of his body. Hodor places Bran on the ground and Bran crawls towards the old man, asking if he is the Three-Eyed Raven who appeared in his visions. The old man admits that he is, having taken several forms in the past, but his true form is before them now. Meera is upset that her brother died to reach him, but the Three-Eyed Raven says that Jojen (who possessed the Greensight, as Bran does) always knew that he would die helping Bran arrive here, but that he came nonetheless. He informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives \"with a thousand eyes, and one.\" He continues by stating that Jojen died so that Bran could come here and regain what he has lost. Bran asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs. The Three-Eyed Raven replies that Bran will never walk again, \"but you will fly.\"  In Meereen In Meereen, Queen Daenerys Targaryen sits in her throne room where she is receiving the day's supplicants. An old man named Fennesz approaches the throne, first speaking in High Valyrian but then revealing that he also knows the Common Tongue. Fennesz explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor, but a well-educated teacher and servant to Master Mighdal, who employed him as a teacher for his own children. He tells Daenerys that Master Mighdal's seven-year-old daughter Calla admires Daenerys, having learned of the Targaryen dynasty through Fennesz's teachings.  As a servant of Master Mighdal, Fennesz was well-treated and even well-respected in the household, but when Daenerys forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city, she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people. Fennesz originally stayed in Master Mighdal's house after she took the city, and Mighdal's children begged him to stay, but Mighdal and Fennesz agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals, forcing Fennesz to become homeless. Daenerys insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them. Fennez says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe: the young prey on the old, assaulting and robbing them. Daenerys insists that her Unsullied will restore order, but Fennesz points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety, he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew. Therefore, he has come to Daenerys to beg her permission to sell himself back to Mighdal. She is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again, as a man might own a goat or a chair. He implores her that the young may rejoice in her new world, but for those too old to change, there is only fear and squalor. Nor, he says, is he alone: there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests.  Daenerys is crestfallen, and says she did not liberate the slaves of Meereen only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy, but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices. Therefore she will allow Fennesz to enter into a labor contract with Mighdal, but lasting no more than one year. He earnestly thanks her, and leaves. Ser Barristan Selmy warns Daenerys that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this, quickly making \"contracts\" with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but name.  Dragons imprisoned Viserion and Rhaegal are imprisoned.  The next supplicant then enters, a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms, similarly to the herdsman who came to show the bones of their livestock which Daenerys's dragons burned in order to be reimbursed. The shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires Missandei to translate. Distraught, he tells Daenerys that the \"winged shadow\" came, placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred bones - of a human child. Daenerys's largest dragon - the black one, Drogon - has roasted the man's three-year-old daughter Zalla until this is all that was left of her. Horrified, Daenerys meets with Missandei and Grey Worm in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of Meereen. Grey Worm reports that Drogon was last seen flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, but he can no longer be found. Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons, Daenerys tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city. Later, she leads her remaining two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, into the catacombs, where they are distracted by sheep carcasses. As they are feeding, Daenerys personally locks huge iron collars around their necks, which are secured by heavy chains. She weeps as she does so, as it is symbolically reducing her remaining \"children\" to chained-up slaves themselves. Daenerys wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place.  In King's Landing In Grand Maester Pycelle's laboratory in King's Landing, Cersei, Pycelle, and Qyburn stand over Ser Gregor Clegane, who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side. Pycelle informs Cersei that Oberyn Martell had coated his spear with manticore venom, poisoning Ser Gregor. The effects are horrific, with Gregor's wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench. Pycelle says that he is beyond any hope of recovery, but Qyburn insists to Cersei that he can save him using more unorthodox methods. Pycelle chafes at his suggestion, stating that he is not even a maester, and that such arrogance is what led to Qyburn's expulsion from the Citadel in the first place, for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and \"unnatural.\" Cersei, determined to save Gregor from death, dismisses Pycelle and orders Qyburn to do whatever is necessary, infuriating Pycelle, who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory. She asks Qyburn if his treatment will work, and Qyburn claims that if his past work is any indicator, he stands a chance at saving Gregor. Qyburn states that the process will \"change\" him, although Cersei seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him, to which Qyburn replies \"Oh no.\" Cersei leaves, and Qyburn begins siphoning out Gregor's tainted blood.  Cersei approaches Tywin and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to Ser Loras Tyrell. He attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed, but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love Loras: he wants to ship her off to Highgarden and remove her from the court entirely, keeping her away from her last remaining son. With Cersei out of the picture, both Margaery and Tywin will attempt to get their claws into Tommen, each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance. Tywin refuses to budge, so Cersei plays her trump card: she threatens to destroy House Lannister by telling everyone the truth. Tywin seems confused, and at first, Cersei scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance. With growing realization, she assesses that even the brilliant Tywin Lannister never noticed what was going on between his own children, when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years. Tywin is still apparently confused, so with a merciless grin Cersei reveals that all of the rumors about her and Jaime (and their children) are true \u2013 she will tell everyone and destroy Tywin's vaunted family legacy, even though it will also mean her death and Tommen's death. Tywin shakes with barely constrained rage, but in denial, he accuses that Cersei is simply lying to anger him. Cersei says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone.  Cersei finds Jaime in the White Sword Tower, and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have Tyrion killed. Cersei asserts that Tyrion killed their mother when she gave birth to him. Jaime is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that, pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened. He insists that Tyrion is her family, whether she chooses to accept it or not. She rebukes his claim, saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice, and that she chooses Jaime. She then reveals that she has spilled their secret to Tywin. He is stunned and concerned by her actions, asking how Tywin reacted to the news, but she states that she does not want to discuss their father. She begins to seduce him, saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world, no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret. He yields to her advances, kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex.  In the middle of the night, Tyrion is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell door being opened by Jaime, who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for Tyrion with the assistance of Varys, who has secured a galley in the harbor on which Tyrion can sneak out of the city and flee to the Free Cities. He leads Tyrion to a stairway leading up to a locked door, instructing Tyrion to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon Varys, who will lead him to the ship. Before they part ways, Tyrion and Jaime share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes, unsure if either will ever see the other again.  Tyrionkillshae (1) Tyrion, having just killed Shae.  Tyrion, alone, stares at the door at the top of the staircase, ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the Red Keep to infiltrate the Tower of the Hand. He enters the Hand of the King's quarters, and sees a woman lying in Tywin's bed, with Tywin's clothes folded up on a chair. As he draws closer he sees that the woman is Shae, who thinks it is Tywin and calls out for him, calling him \"my lion\" as she had once done to Tyrion. When she turns over and sees that it is Tyrion, looking utterly betrayed, she grabs a knife to defend herself. Tyrion could retreat but instead, he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp. Tyrion manages to knock the knife from her hands and the two continue to struggle violently until Tyrion manages to grab the necklace around her throat that he had given her and strangles her with it. Tyrion continues to strangle her long after she has stopped resisting, until she is dead. He sinks to the floor and sits next to Shae's lifeless body, weeping, and tells her he's sorry. He stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display, among them Joffrey's old crossbow, and his expression quickly darkens.  Tyrion takes the crossbow down from the wall, loads it, and heads down the hall to the privy, opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet. Tywin seems surprised to see Tyrion, but quickly regains composure and asks Tyrion to lower the weapon. He correctly deduces that Jaime helped Tyrion escape his cell, telling Tyrion that they can discuss the matter back in Tywin's chambers. However, when he attempts to stand, Tyrion steadies the crossbow, stopping him dead in his tracks. \"All my life you've wanted me dead,\" Tyrion states, and Tywin acknowledges the validity of his claim. He attempts to defuse the situation by telling Tyrion that he admires his son's will to survive despite any attempts to kill him and insists that he was never going to have Tyrion actually killed. Tyrion admits that he just murdered Shae with his bare hands, but Tywin scoffs that it doesn't matter as she was nothing more than a whore. Tyrion is angered by Tywin's indifference and raises the crossbow, threatening that if his father says the word \"whore\" one more time he will kill him. Tywin balks that Tyrion won't kill his own father in the privy, and again tries to convince Tyrion that they should continue to discuss the matter in his chambers. Tyrion says he cannot go back to Tywin's chambers because Shae's body is still there. Tywin dares Tyrion by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying \"because you're afraid of a dead whore?\"  The children Tyrion with Bow S4 Tyrion kills his father.  The moment Tywin utters the word \"whore\" again, Tyrion loosens his crossbow bolt, hitting Tywin in the belly and knocking him backward. Tywin is incredulous that Tyrion actually had the courage to fight back against him, and that he will die in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son. As Tyrion reloads the crossbow, Tywin angrily declares that Tyrion is no son of his. \"I am your son,\" Tyrion replies quietly, \"I have always been your son,\" and fires a second bolt into Tywin's heart, killing him. Tyrion discards the crossbow as he leaves to find Varys, who immediately realizes that Tyrion has done something terrible, exclaiming \"What have you done?\" Nonetheless, he leads Tyrion out of the castle to the docks where Tyrion is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship. Varys begins walking back towards the Red Keep but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll, signaling the discovery of Tywin's body. Realizing that returning to the castle is likely unsafe, Varys turns around and heads back for the ship, sitting next to Tyrion's crate in silence as they cast off for Essos.   In the Vale of Arryn In the Vale, Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne are heading towards the Bloody Gate when they happen upon Arya Stark practicing her water dancing while Sandor Clegane is off relieving himself, both returning from the Eyrie after receiving words of Lysa Arryn's death. Brienne and Arya converse for a moment, both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives. They are interrupted by the return of the Hound, who is immediately recognized by Podrick, causing Brienne to realize that the girl is Arya. Brienne tells Arya of her sacred vow to protect her mother, although she failed to do so because she was sent by her mother to return Jaime Lannister. The Hound immediately accuses Brienne of working for the Lannisters, noticing her Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper, which Brienne admits was given to her by Jaime, frightening Arya into thinking that Brienne is working for the Lannisters. Brienne implores Arya to come with her to safety, causing the Hound to mock Brienne, pointing out that there is no \"safety\" for Arya anymore: her aunt Lysa Arryn in the Eyrie \u2013 whom Brienne and Podrick are seeking out \u2013 is dead, as are her father, mother, and older brother, while the Stark armies are scattered and Winterfell is a smoking ruin. They draw swords and begin fighting, both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in hand-to-hand combat. Ultimately, Brienne gains the upper hand (by biting off a chunk of Sandor's ear) and knocks him down a cliffside. Brienne goes to search for Arya, who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the rock formations. As Brienne and Podrick search the surrounding area for Arya in vain, Arya makes her way down the cliffside to find the Hound badly wounded. He tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on hand to tend to his wounds, he's finished. Sandor tells her to kill him and scratch another name off her list, but she just sits and stares at him silently. To goad Arya into killing him, an angry Sandor begins recounting running down the butcher's boy and how he should have raped Sansa in King's Landing, but she remains silent. Sandor finally begs her to kill him and put him out of his misery, but she refuses and takes his money purse, leaving him screaming at her to kill him as she walks away.  S04E10 - Arya (on the ship) Arya on her way to Braavos.  Arya rides a horse to Saltpans on the coast of the Vale, where she sees a wharf with ships docked. She approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the North, but he says that they won't go there because these days the North is full of war, cold, and pirates. Instead, the ship is going \"home\": to the Free City of Braavos. Arya remembers the special coin that the Faceless Man known as Jaqen H'ghar gave her, and instructed her to present to any man from Braavos if she needed aid. She does so now, and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it, but she says only \"Valar morghulis\" (as Jaqen instructed), to which the captain gives the traditional response, \"Valar dohaeris.\" He warmly welcomes her aboard the ship, and insists that she will have her own cabin. As the ship casts off, Arya stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of Westeros shrinks further and further away. She then moves to the prow of the ship, looking forward across the Narrow Sea in the direction of the Free Cities and Braavos. "], "review": null}, "40": {"id": "s05e00", "name": "A Day in the Life", "script": "( music playing )  Duncan Muggoch: Although this is TV,  it's TV in a scale that is beyond anything else.  Peter Welter Soler: It's the most successful TV show in the world right now.  It is special. Very, very special.  Chris Newman: Today we're shooting in Croatia,  they're shooting in Belfast,  and they're preparing for shooting in Seville down in Spain.  Whatever hand you're dealt, you have to go with it  because the show can't stop.  Bernie Caulfield: I think we're the only ones in the world  that shoot with two units  at the same time all season long.  If one of those spokes in the wheel are missing,  it's gonna collapse.  Director: And, action!  ( crowd cheering )   Morning.  How are you all?  My name is Duncan Muggoch and I'm the UK line producer  for Croatia and Spain, or what we also call  the southern locations for \"Game of Thrones\" season five.  This is my second season. I did Croatia last year.  And this year we've obviously got Spain thrown into it as well.  So I'm line producing both of them this year.  And even though last year was big, this one's even bigger.  My name is Chris Newman. I'm one of the producers on \"Game of Thrones.\"  I fulfill a function here of planning how the two units work  and drift in between the sets, the locations, and the different countries.  So how was yesterday? All right?  - Yes. Yeah, it was good. It was really good, yeah. - Yes? Good.  Newman: We start shooting at the end of July.  99% of the crew have been here before.  So when you start day one,  it feels like day 301  in a good way.  As this is going on here, over in Spain  we have Peter who runs Fresco Films.  He's new to this year, so he doesn't know quite how manic it can get.  My name is Peter Welter Soler.  I'm the Spanish line producer on this show.  The production booklets, are we getting them tonight?  Welter Soler: We have two weeks left before everybody arrives.  And then two days later, we start shooting.  I'd be lying if I said the stress level is not increasing,  because obviously this is very important for all of us.  Doing it for the first time, we want to please everybody.  We want to do a great job.  This is actually maybe not the calm before the storm.  It is the rehearsal before the show. ( chuckles )  We're heading from our unit base into Dubrovnik, into the old town.  Filming here is quite different from filming in Belfast  'cause the logistics over here are very different.  One of the logistical problems of Dubrovnik  is it's such a tight, small, old city  that we can't get our big vehicles actually into the town  just 'cause the streets are so narrow.  It's just one of the challenges that we face  filming in a city like this.  You can't take vehicles within the old walls,  so everything has to get taken by Sherpas  up to a location today which is probably  one of the furthest and trickiest you could get to in the whole city.  A little rule that I have for myself on location,  and this is never go up empty-handed or come down empty-handed.  Now it's just a load of stairs all the way up to the top.  Hello, gorgeous.  Good. Good, good.  Muggoch: The principal actors are just arriving on set  to rehearse.  They will do a rehearsal with the director first,  and then they'll do a full crew rehearsal,  which is when they'll place where the cameras are gonna go and everything like that.  Man: Okay, guys, give us the set, please.  Hey, Joseph. How are you? Nice to see you.  Newman: Episode one and two have been in Croatia.  They've done most of their filming and they're back here finishing up  now that Emilia has finished in Croatia.  ( growling )  - Do that. Just growl at one point. - ( growls )  So this morning, episode one and two with Mike Slovis directing  are setting up to do their first scene this season in Dany's penthouse.  Morning, everybody. Hello.  Newman: So it's right at the beginning of the-- season five  and it's the first time Dany gets an inkling  of what's going on in Meereen under her new rule.  And then do you want it to be a boom,  I've decided I will not have them?  Or do you want it to be kind of like--  - No, I think it's more gentle. - It's gentle?  It is gentle? Okay, lovely. Yeah.  I have shot mostly in Belfast.  I have shot several days in Croatia  and I am going to shoot in Seville.  Teach them a better way.  It sounds like something Jorah would have said.  Slovis: Moving to a foreign country on this show  is not as disruptive as you might think  because one of the two crews  that you've already worked with here goes there.  So the first thing that happens when you walk on the set  is that you see familiar faces.  Kay Bilk: My priority today is looking after Emilia  because she's come from Croatia,  so we're matching continuity to that country.  They send their photos to us  so that we can do the same as they've been doing.  Rosalia Culora: There's two departments filming at the same time,  so it's imperative that things like wigs,  continuity photos all travel together  and that every member of the team is aware of what the look is,  because if we do have to take over someone's artist,  we know exactly what we're doing and there's no mess-ups  when we're watching the show, hopefully.  Slovis: Let's do one for camera, please.  Okay.  Man: Let's have it quiet for rehearsal, please.  And that means everybody in here, thank you.  Action.  So the only thing that gave him pride  was knowing there was someone lower than he was.  - Morning. - Morning.  - How are you? - Good.  - Morning, Duncan. Morning, Mr. Muggoch. - Morning.  Oh, I want to talk to Peter today or maybe you can.  Peter Welter? Yeah, no, I'm talking with him.  About C\u00f3rdoba bridge and the drone.  Muggoch: As far as I'm concerned, Bernie is \"Game of Thrones.\"  I've never met a producer that cares for a crew as much as she does.  She's an incredible woman to work for, actually,  and everybody loves her.  And she keeps everything together.  And do they want to clear a place in that?  So the bridge has to be closed.  That's-- I'm checking on.  Along with David and Dan, she's the executive producer.  David and Dan are obviously-- you know, they're the creators of it.  It's their baby.  Bernie is the one that keeps this show running.  Sometimes David and Dan will be with us.  Sometimes they are separate so that they can both be on the set,  depending what the scene might be,  will watch rehearsal, give their notes on the scene,  and then a lot of times we're discussing what is in advance.  As you can imagine, with 10 episodes,  that we're constantly prepping.  Much like our characters, we will go from the amazing Daznak  right into the amazing Hardhome.  Caulfield: I usually have a nice list for them every day.  They almost cringe when they see me starting to come towards them  and open my book to start asking my questions.  But they're fantastically collaborative with all of us.  Today, they're having a big Hardhome meeting up in Belfast.  - They got the notes? - Yes. Yeah.  Caulfield: When we're shooting in different countries,  it's about a constant communication  between the producers in each country.  I'm gonna follow Nutter over to Spain early.  You're staying here through Illyrio's, right?  Are we doing a charter to Sevilla?  We are, yes, but I'm going to leave ahead of time.  Yeah, which goes on the 8th.  I'll go on the charter this time.  - Hope there's a seat for me. - There'll be a seat for you.  You can have Bernie's seat. ( laughs )  In a week, we will all take off in a charter  to go to Spain and that is now starting to come very close.  After they have their big scout today,  then we'll have more information to go off of for that.  ( birds chirping )  Welter Soler: We're in the royal palaces of Seville  called the Real Alc\u00e1zar, which are palaces built  by Peter the Horrible in the 13th century.  It's one of the most visited monuments in Spain.  The Alc\u00e1zar will be, like, the water gardens of Dorne.  Since Dorne is a new world that's just come into the show--  it was introduced in the fourth season,  but we didn't really see it--  now in the fifth season, they will finally get to see  the Kingdom of Dorne.  - ( speaking Spanish ) - Good morning once again.  Welter Soler: It is difficult to shoot in a place like that  because it was obviously not built as a set,  but built for a purpose, a different purpose than ours.  ( speaking Spanish )  Some of the places, as you see in the balcony, for instance,  I mean, you can't possibly get some of the gear up there  because the staircase is too narrow.  So we have to get a crane in--  Genie Booms, cranes, platforms--  in order to haul that material up there.  ( speaking Spanish )  - It's tricky, you know? - Okay.  It's not like a back lot studio shoot.  First and second shooting day is up here.  And then we move down to the garden.  We'll get control of the garden, I'm assuming?  As far as you told me, we have the entire garden area for us, correct?  - Yes, I have this note here. - It's pretty amazing.  Welter Soler: They have, like, an average of 8,000 tourists in here every day.  To see it, like, empty and have it just for us is just a privilege.  Wherever you go, there's always gonna be a challenge  because you're in a new place both culturally and logistically.  We'll have to find a compromise  where we can work together with the palace.  We're the foreigners coming into their country,  trying to put this project together.  I have to say they're being extremely nice,  which is-- so we need to make sure that our--  which they always are-- but our crew are very careful  in this delicate location.  Welter Soler: And what they're doing for us is unique as well.  It's never been locked off like this for anybody.  All right, so will you go and check the others?  - Sure. - Because I think we're running a bit late now.  We're now driving up to a little village called Magheramorne  in which there is a quarry that's been there for a number of years now.  And in season one  we built the set of Castle Black there.  Because there's a lake in the quarry,  in season two we built the battlements of King's Landing  for the Battle of Blackwater  with Stannis's boats attacking.  It's still standing, although it's looking a bit worn these days.  Now we're driving up to have a look at a set mid-construction  of a fishing village set north of the Wall.  We'll begin to see how that's taking shape this morning.  The set that we see down here,  it's a fishing village that is a protected fishing village.  It's not a military establishment.  It was designed to be somewhere where people  had a living off the sea.  So we needed the water, which is why we put it  on the edge of the reservoir here.  The fantastic thing about the Hardhome set  is we're building something that is so far north this time  that what we get to do is create a fishing village  that is exactly as the name describes.  It's Hardhome. What we've been doing  both in concepts and in models  is looking at the location out in Magheramorne  and created what we need for the action,  which is a longhouse in which a lot of action takes place.  And then we have the landing area,  which we're able to use the lake that exists in Magheramorne.  And so through having those sort of necessary requirements,  we can then build this sort of tent city  that will be created out there.  So I had this good idea,  which I need to pitch, I guess,  which is to hold onto that shot.  Miguel Sapochnik: The director can now see the bones of the whole set,  so he's gonna walk through the set and start mapping out  where all the things that he's imagined will take place.  If the plan to do that shot-- it's the boater's point of view,  so it's looking through the fence.  Sapochnik: So anything at this point  that the director would like to change,  this is the time that he has to turn around and say,  \"Well, could I put the door in the hut over here?\"  and, \"Could I have this a bit higher?\" or so on.  Good, so, yeah, we good with this?  - Yeah. - Rock and roll, so  - shall we have a look - Look at this edge here and see if that works.  Newman: \"Game of Thrones\" is a big event,  and what you mustn't do  is get put off by the bigness of it.  The thing to do is to come in and say,  \"All I've got to worry about is the 16x9.  What's in that frame.\" It must be like parachuting.  Don't worry about the height you're jumping,  just make sure the parachute works.  ( crew chatting )  It doesn't have to be a sparrow.  Muggoch: Today we've got about 128 extras out  and then everything that goes with that,  which is the extra hair people, makeup people,  costume people that have to deal with all of that.  Nina Ayres: Crowds start dressing about 5:00 this morning.  And then just in conjunction with hair and makeup,  we're just sort of working around each other.  And then everybody travelled to set about 7:30  to be all set for 8:00.  Just need to take your blankets off, guys,  so we can look at your costumes, please.  Muggoch: Mark Mylod is the director,  and he's now going to select the extras  that he wants to feature in the scene.  Yep, this gentleman. And one other lady.  It changed a bit this morning because people had to look  a bit poorer than we'd originally intended.  I'd just like to maybe darken a couple of teeth or something.  A bit of the teeth black, you know, just one or two of those.  And maybe-- okay, the skin's pretty good.  Just a little less healthy.  And so it was a bit of a scramble trying to get everybody  broken down enough to look a bit poorer than they had done.  And it's still happening.  People are still getting dirtied up as we speak.  - Thank you, guys. Well done. - Brilliant.  - Thank you. See you soon. - Thank you.  We had more than 86,000 applications  to be a background extra in the show.  People from not only all over Spain,  but all over Europe, even from California,  from Argentina, from South Africa,  wanting to come to the casting,  wanting to be part of \"Game of Thrones.\"  - Hello. - How are you?  - Good. - Peter. Buenos d\u00edas.  - Buenos d\u00edas. - Buenas tardes.  - Oh, buenas tardes. - Buenas tardes is the afternoon.  Maybe you just got up.  I just had a siesta.  - Okay, then it's good morning again. - Thank you.  There's gonna be about 1,000 costumes to do 600 extras.  Stephen O'Rawe: Because it's such a major operation,  we're doing something like 50, 60 fittings a day, which normally we do 30.  We fit everybody here, males, females, in and out.  We do guards, slaves. There's a rogue slave.  Welter Soler: There's a slave over there. Hello, slave.  O'Rawe: They process down here  and these guys put on the hair.  Jenny puts on makeup and they do their magic.  We're moving around very quickly.  We're shooting in three or four different places  all straight after each other.  But we, like, have to go in advance and prep 600, 700 people  all ready for a camera that moves behind us.  We're basically set here.  I like when things are just smooth.  Muggoch: We've got Lena Headey and Jonathan Pryce today.  We're shooting a scene here from episode three  which is a kind of rundown area,  behind the Sept of Baelor.  And it's a scene where Cersei is looking  to have a conversation with the High Sparrow  who is a whole new character.  We've got a beautiful courtyard  which is actually a former convent.  And we are disguising it with a lot of awnings  and a lot of ground cover on the floor.  And it's supposed to be a really shocking place  where Cersei encounters the poverty  that she has managed to ignore for most of her time  living in King's Landing.  I'm standing there looking butch and macho.  - I do a lot of that. - Man: Can you show us?  - That's it. That's it. - There's no  - No jiggling? - No, that's it.  If I jiggle, I sound like \"Jingle Bells.\"  So I can't actually move. I'm not allowed to move.  I have to stand still.  Muggoch: From walking about, we're in every street there is.  It's only started a few days ago,  so we haven't been here long enough yet  to really cause chaos, but it'll come.  Dubrovnik is understandably a big tourist attraction,  so you're normally fighting through the crowds.  That's been a difficulty on the sets.  Rolling! Nice and quiet.  ( speaks Croatian )  - Roll camera. - Rolling!  - Rolling! - Sound speed.  17, take one, C marker only.  And, action!  I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.  Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people.  Where can I find the High Sparrow?  ( man coughs )  - Director: Cut. Cut. - Man: Cut!  - Why did you do that? - I don't believe you did that!  Are you all right?  - Wanker. - That's it, we're on strike.  No, we're on strike. Fuck you. Go on.  You get into the fucking pelican. See how you like it.  ( groans )  ( coughs ) No?  - Cut. - You know what?  I can't even lift-- I can't lift my arm  - 'cause it's like a T-rex. - Hit me, come on.  You think you're fucking tough? Come on.  Come on, harder. Come on, harder.  ( bell tolling )  Newman: Belfast remains the heart of the whole thing.  It's a major city, so we have all the things  that a big film crew need.  But, you know, you drive 20 minutes out of the city  and you're in the heart of the countryside.  It helps with the ancient feel of the show  that the landscape has a feeling of being old.  It's been worn down and eroded.  And everything has that ancient feel to it no matter where you go.  You know, the woods feel old, the cliff tops feel old,  and the moorlands certainly look old, you know.  I always like to go to the set every day  because that's been my heart.  This is my 40th year in the film business  and my heart has always been in making a film.  I've always loved the set.  You can always kind of tell how the day is going  by the way Chris is standing and looking at everyone around set.  ( laughing )  Newman: I have no idea. Some of them look at my face  and think if it's looking very long, we must be in trouble,  but that's not the case.  I might be thinking about something entirely different.  I always find him very calm and very relaxed  given that he's producing this massive, epic show.  Newman: We shoot this year 120 days.  But in those 120 days, we do shoot two units,  so you double it.  You're effectively shooting 240 days of screen time.  ( speaking Valyrian )  Today on set I'm mostly concerned with the Valyrian.  We have a scene with the Valyrian language in,  so I'm looking after the actors  and making sure that they feel comfortable with their lines.  'Cause some of the sounds are quite tricky to get through.  Director: All right, guys. Here we go. Shooting.  Let's have it quiet.  Let's roll cameras, please.  Man: Rolling.  Director: Action.  I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.  ( man speaking Valyrian )  ( speaking Valyrian )  Find the men who did this and bring them to me.  - Your Grace. - And cut it.  Let's go one more time. Hey, Sean, I think  Welter Soler: Right now, we are in a town called Osuna.  And it has this beautiful old bull ring  and it's a national monument as well.  When we walked into this bull ring,  it was just the place they were looking for.  The stone is quite similar to the stone they have shot in Croatia.  - Made some great progress. - Yes.  Welter Soler: This does not have to be a bull ring.  It needs to be something completely different,  and that's why we need to transform it into that place.  Building the balcony where the actors are going to go to the ground.  We had to cover up all the pillars.  There will be a lot of things added to that.  We're shooting just one single scene in here  and it's 12 days. It's quite complex.  There's a lot of action happening and we need that time.  The pressure is so high to meet the expectancies  of what is involved in there.  It was just incredible.  All right, ladies and gents, thank you very much.  - That's a wrap for today. - ( bell rings )  Quiet down, people. Listen, clear the cameras,  clear the lights, the equipment.  Newman: Here was a very stable,  interesting day for the character Daenerys.  And then, of course, we had the big trip out to see the set of Hardhome  and it did open up a lot of questions  which will continue to be looked at in weeks to come.  You do the best you can, get everything as ready as you can,  and then you cross your fingers.  Caulfield: Today went very well.  We finished our work. David and Dan were happy,  which is always my goal of the day  when they come out with a smile.  Chris and I will talk and compare notes.  Another two days down. That's the beauty of shooting two units every day.  It's the only job that can live two days in one.  ( laughs )  Muggoch: At the moment, the main thing I'm thinking about  is getting out of Croatia.  We've got a lot of stuff to move to Spain,  so that's where all my thought is going at the moment.  And obviously trying to set up Spain at the same time.  Yeah.  And getting through every day of filming.  ( chuckles ) And knowing that there's big scenes coming up.  - Yeah. - Man: So it doesn't stop?  No, it doesn't stop, no.  Welter Soler: Every day there are things that you don't expect.  Not having shot with any of the crew before  obviously increases the stress level.  - Hello, Croatia. - Muggoch: Hello, Spain.  So, how is it all going?  Welter Soler: As much as the shooting date is moving closer  and everybody is aware more and more of the fact  that we have less time,  yeah, stress level is increasing.  Definitely. Definitely.  Welter Soler: Production arriving in the past 10 days  was actually very good.  There was a lot of people rolling up.  There's probably 450 people working behind the camera.  Director: All right, let's roll cameras, please.  - Man: Rolling! - Man #2: Let's roll camera!  - ( clapper snaps ) - Director: And background action.  Welter Soler: The first day of shooting is always crucial to us  because it shows us if everything we did  in order to prepare it was the right thing.  ( crowd cheering )  ( shouting )  Director: Okay, here we go.  And, action!  ( shouting )  This year, Belfast has got some big sets like Hardhome  and the art department and construction have done a really great job  of turning what was a notion into reality.", "summary": null, "review": null}, "41": {"id": "s05e01", "name": "The Wars to Come", "script": "A royal wedding is history.

Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means? It means I'll become king. Yes. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. I demand a trial by combat.

Let's kill some crows! - We shouldn't be out here alone. - Why not? - If your father - He'll never know we're gone. But if he finds out You don't need to be afraid of my father. Are you sure? Yes. - We shouldn't go in. - Of course we should. Get out. Get out! - Let's go. - No. Listen to your friend. They said that you were terrifying with cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring. You don't know what I am. I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine. Everyone wants to know their future until they know their future. This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head. Your blood. Give me a taste. Three questions you get. You won't like the answers. I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry? You will never wed the prince. You will wed the king. But I will be queen? Oh, yes. You'll be queen. For a time. Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear. W-will the king and I have children? No. The king will have 20 children and you will have three. That doesn't make sense. Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds. Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei! Bearers, put it down. Bearers, up. Away. Your Grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting. They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him. But, Your Grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms. They will wait. He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard, but here you are, protecting his dead body. What he built, it's ours. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away. - All of it. - They? All of them out there, our enemies. They're waiting in line to make sure he's really dead. And as soon as they see the stones on his eyes, they'll set to work on tearing us apart. They have nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart. He's the enemy. I've been telling you for years. You've been defending him for years. This is exactly what they want. And now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free? Tyrion may be a monster, but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something, you do it. Never mind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world. Apologies. I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail. I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that fucking crate. Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those airholes? No, I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard. Pentos? The home of my colleague Illyrio Mopatis, a merchant. He and I met many years ago through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting a Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself. Mmm. Much better. My lord? I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't imagine they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. It must happen all the time. You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea. In a box. Why stop now? Because we are talking about the future of our country. The future is shit. Just like the past. _ _ _ _ _ Shh. Shh. The Sons of the Harpy? Yes, Your Grace. They left it on the body. They've never killed before. It was only a matter of time, Your Grace. Conquerors always meet with resistance. I didn't conquer them. Their own people did. _ _ He did not risk his life fighting for his freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost? White Rat, Your Grace. I want him buried with honor, publically in the Temple of the Graces. The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message. Make them very angry. Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me. Your Grace. Torgo Nudho. Missandei hin Naath. I wanted to speak with you. Why do you come? White Rat, the Unsullied who I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel? I do not know. I must go. - Get your shield up. - It's too heavy. If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword. Now get it up. Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell. Shouldn't you be training, too? Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say that they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history. - Shield up. - These men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves. Not soldiers. That one hates me. If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander He hates the wildlings. All the wildlings. - Don't let them send us away. -  It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser Sam, don't let them send us away. I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too. You can't leave. They'll execute you. - Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot. - Yah! Shield up. The king wants a word. You're not cold, my lady? Never. The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow. Feel. Are you a virgin? No. Good. Your Grace. The bastard of Winterfell. You know who rules at Winterfell now? Roose Bolton. Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger in Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him? I want a great many things, Your Grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now. I've been talking to your sworn brothers. - Many of them love you. - They're good men. Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why? It's where she belonged. Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings. They were born on the wrong side of the Wall. That doesn't make them monsters. No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell, I need more men. The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings. Your Grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army? If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on. It's a fair offer. More than fair. I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty. I don't think that's likely. You admire him, don't you? - I respect him. - He likes you. - Convince him to bend the knee - Your Grace. or he burns. How much time do I have? Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow. Shield up. Attack, my lord! Attack! Don't cross your feet. My sons had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior. Great warrior? He swings a sword like a girl with palsy. My lord. Sword up, my lord! Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young. He's 13. Boys go to war at 13. - He has other gifts. - Does he? The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs. Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me. I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady. I have no doubt that on my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably. He'll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises. Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days' ride from the Kingsroad. - But that will take us - Us? The only reason you're here is because Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe. - But I'm your squire. - Do you even know what a squire is? An attendant to a knight. I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire. Well, where would I go? I don't care. I'm not your mother. You swore to find the Stark girls. I found Arya. She didn't want my protection. -  Sansa still might. - Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for your advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters. You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers. I did. - But we're heading west. - We are. If he wanted to betray us, he already would have. Lord Royce might be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls? No, do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us? No. But I pay them well and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me. So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone? To a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you. It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a A force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such, but But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a what a force to be reckoned with. Thank you so much for your kind words. Deepest condolences, Your Grace. This tragedy I never trusted Varys. I often warned Your Grace. Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you. My deepest sympathies. I apologize for my son's appearance. Uncle, it's quite all right. They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive. I'm sure he'll grow out of it, whatever it is. - Excuse me. - Of course. Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed. It wasn't my wounds that needed healing. What can I do for you? You can forgive me. What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness? I led you into the darkness. I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere. I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king his boar hunt. His wine. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a different person now. I've found peace in the light of the Seven. You can, too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul. The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help - It looks like Dorne. - It doesn't. It does. That's the That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is Is Sunsnake? Stonespear? Sandstone. Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there. Fine. It's Dorne. We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time, judging by my experience. That would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here. We're late for dinner as it is. You're very respectful. I'm very hungry. What's your name? Olyvar, my lady. I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar. My lady. Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet? Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this? In any event, you shouldn't keep your intended waiting. My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me. - Lucky you. - Unlucky you. You think I want that woman married to my brother? If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law. Perhaps. Perhaps? Perhaps. Eunuch, the Spider, the Master of Whisperers. Imp, Half-man. There are faster ways to kill yourself. Not for a coward. You are many things, my friend, but not a coward. You never told me why you set me free. Your brother asked me to. Could have said no. Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition. Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family. You owe me nothing. I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms. A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come. You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me. You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work. I'm not well-suited for work. I think you are. You have your father's instincts for politics. And you have compassion. Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I never said you were perfect. What is it you want exactly? Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless. Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless. That's how they became powerful in the first place. Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror, we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land? I will never sit on the Iron Throne. No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name. Good luck finding him. Who said anything about \"him\"? You have a choice, my friend. You can stay here at Illyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Meereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for. Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen? When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves. Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freed men and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review. Good. They did ask for some concessions. Concessions? Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace. I'm not a politician. I'm a queen. Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones. I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich. I ended slavery. They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the reopening of the fighting pits. The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death? In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men. The pit fighters you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself. No fighting pits. Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions. I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting. If you - How many times must I say no before you understand? Whatever he wants from me, he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits You should reopen the fighting pits. What? My mother was a whore. I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before. I'm sorry. Why? I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16. You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits? I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master, he set me free when he died. I joined the Second Sons. And then I met you. You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now. That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets. Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons. I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore. A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen. Viserion? Rhaegal? Easy. Easy. Easy. So here we are. Here we are. When we first met, you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting This doesn't have to be our last meeting. No, but it will be. You know what Stannis wants? He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much, he's bold. Shouldn't a king be bold? Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him. You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough. That's right. I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either. You spent your life convincing for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the Wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride? Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that. Then bend the knee and save your people. They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a southern king, that's all gone. And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid. Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging? They'll burn you alive. Bad way to go. I'll be honest with you. I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that, scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe. And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing and they'll sing songs about you. You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero. Until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and there's no one left to sing. You're a good lad. Truly you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining. I think you're making a terrible mistake. The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted. Mance Rayder, you've been called the King-beyond-the-Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy. Kneel and live. This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come. We all must choose. Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light or we choose darkness. We choose good or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false. Free folk, there is only one true king and his name is Stannis.

Cersei Walder Frey The Mountain Meryn Trant Must be good food if it's crowded. Ale? Ale? Before we left, a maester gave you a raven's scroll. You are becoming an observant young lady. My mother used to say \"dark wings dark words\". An old saying. Inaccurate in this case. So it's good news. My marriage proposal has been accepted. I thought you still mourned the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa. - Ale? - I'll have some. My Lady - What is it? - Sansa Stark. Don't look! You sure? She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish. Littlefinger? A bunch of knights with them. Bunch? BunchSix? Twenty? Ten, I think. Too many. My Lady, I don't think this is Ready the horses! We only have one horse. Find more! Do you like the taste? Don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much? It gives some men courage. Does it give you courage? That's far enough. Lord Baelish. Lady Sansa. My name is Brienne of Tarth. We've met, with Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, Your loyalty came free of charge. Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then. Lady Sansa. Before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I will find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your counsel, and give my life for you if needs be. I swear it by the Old Gods and the New. Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword. - I was. - Strange. I knew Cat since the time we were children. She never mentioned you. It was after Renly's murder. Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him. I tried to save him. - But you were accused. - By men who did not see what happened. And what did happen? He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly, she failed. She swore to protect your mother, she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa? Why should you have any say in her affairs? Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death. We're family now. And you are an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne. But experience has made me wary of outsiders. Lady Sansa - if we can have a word alone - No. - Please, my Lady, if I can explain - I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king. Neither of us wanted to be there. - Sometimes we don't have a choice. - And sometimes we do. You should leave. We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads in these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay? I'm gonna ask you to stay. Stop! Stop! After him! Podrick! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! That's a good boy. Come on. Come on! No, no, no, stop! Guess that means you're unarmed. Don't! Put that down! Podrick? Yes, my Lady? You can stand now. Yes, my Lady. Sansa Stark? Wary of strangers, as she should be. I saw her riding on the Eastroad with Littlefinger. - We'll follow them. - My Lady if both Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow. I swore to their mother I would protect those girls. They don't want your protection. You think she's safe with Littlefinger? No, my Lady. Get your horse. A summons from the Queen. There are only two like it in the world. The one I'm wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella. It's a threat. Of course it's a threat. Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. It's a threat, No note? They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister. And every other tragedy that has befallen their accursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her. Softer. What? Not so loud. Our daughter is in danger and you're worried I am speaking too loudly? No one can know she's our daughter. Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her. If I was a father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets. And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding, our only daughter shipped off to Dorne, our baby boy set to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden! I'm gonna make things better. You've never made anything better. I'm going to Dorne. And I'm bringing our daughter home. You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back. She's promised to his son. I'm not going to ask him anything. You go down there with an army it's an act of war. No army. Do you know where they're keeping her? Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens. I'll find her. Is there anything else, Your Grace? You're going to Dorne. A one-handed man. Alone. Who said I was going alone? No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes. I hate flutes. We can have a harp, if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. The food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're gonna need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they? Don't they? Don't who? People eat pigeon pie in the capital. They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do. It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this. You won't. Pardon? We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older. She hates me. She calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when mother's not looking. You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person. She is. I've been all over the world and if there's one thing I've learned, is that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming for them, eventually. One way or another. Who's that? Jaime fucking Lannister. Ser Jaime? Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I was very sorry to hear about your father. Thank you. This is my betrothed, Lollys. A pleasure. Run along, love. Beautiful young bride you've chosen. When are you planning on getting married? Just get on with it. On with what? What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me. It's very good for you. Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken. Mmm. We've made a deal, your sister and I. I would have advised against that. How is this good for me? Because you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return I'm gonna give you a much better girl and a much better castle. Return from where? As far south as south goes. You are my queen. The prince does not wish to be disturbed. Remove yourself from my path or I'll take that long axe and I'll shove it up your Captain let her pass. Your brother was murdered and you sit here in the Water Gardens staring at the sky and doing nothing. Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by law, that is no murder. - Your brother - You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you. What will you know about his death? I will bury him. I will mourn for him. And then? You would have me go to war. The whole country would have you go to war. Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide. The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge their father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing. Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill? Let me have her. Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time. I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that, you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule. And how long would that be? The Unsullied are too conspicuous. Anyone can see them coming from a mile off. 'Course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you? My Second Sons on the other hand they drink, they whore, fight in streets, they blend in. They overhear things in taverns. Follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys. Break a few fingers, overhear a few more things before you know it No one here. We go. In a hurry? You're afraid? Unsullied fear nothing. Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you forgot what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide. Fear is useful that way. Sons of the Harpy they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace - you must kill him. - It would send a message. I think you should exercise restraint - Your Grace. - Why? Well, for one thing, he may have valuable information. Well, the Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information. How do you know that? Because I questioned him. And the information you did get he is young and.. He is born free. Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him? Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was. They pay him. Great families, afraid to do a thing. They pay poor men to do it for them. And how do you know this? - Everyone know this. - I don't know it. And I'm the head of a great family. We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial at least. A fair trial. Show all the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose you. Teach them a better way. I do not know the place from where old ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial these mean nothing to them. All they understand is blood. Thank you all for your counsel. Your Grace a word, please, I beg you. About what? About your father. - About the Mad King. - The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded. Your Grace I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie. Go on. When the people rose in revolt against him your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with wildfire and laughed as they screamed, and his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two. I'm not my father. No, Your Grace, thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time, it made him feel powerful and right until the very end. I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial. Your Grace. There's a bug. Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food. When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box? - You don't like it? - I want to take a walk. You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head. She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere. Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything. You're right, there's no point. The road to Volantis? You said we are going to Meereen. What's in Volantis? The road to Meereen. And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen? I told you. A ruler. But you've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it. You are quite good, do you know? At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand. I didn't rule, I was a servant. Still, a man of talent. Managed to kill a lot of people? Yes, but you showed great promise in other areas as well. She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go. Why? 'Cause I liked it. Power even as a servant. People follow leaders and they will never follow us. They find us repulsive. I find us repulsive. And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet no matter what we do people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long. You're right. - Let's go for a walk. - No. How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all? Not him. You're trying to deceive your queen? Should I throw them in a cell, Your Grace? It won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made. - Thank you, Your Grace. - Thanks. - Thank you, Your Grace. - Thank you. Take the head. Let me, Your Grace. I would take it if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work. Very good. Over there would be fine. You heard the man, over there. You're the hand of the King. No, uncle. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself. Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand - until he becomes full - You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine we'll have the time. In addition to be Master of Ships, the King has appointed you Master of Coin. Oh, Your Grace. He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the Crown's interest in the same. The honor is all mine, Your Grace. Y-Y-Your Grace, in the past, on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand. The King's named Qyburn the new Master of Whispers. Your Grace, this-this man? Th-This embarassment to the Citadel? Your Grace what qualifications can he possibly have for this post? The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have. I must say I can not Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as Commander of the Lannister Armies, it would please the King if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title. That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the King himself. Well, the King is very busy at this moment. He should be here, learning what it means to rule. He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf. I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother, and to you, and to serve the King. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the Small Council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission. What mission? That is not your concern as Master of War. I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more. You would abandon your king in his time of need? If he wants to send for me, I'll be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock. Come on, you know this one. It looks like an animal. Snake. S-S-Sn \"S\". - It's an \"S\". - Right, very good. Hmm, did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10? I know \"S\". You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos. Old people are terrible at learning new things. Well, you are a wonderful teacher. Very patient. I only said that the more time that you spend practicing the faster you will be able to read. That's all right. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about. How old were you when you learned how to read? - 3. - 3? Were you taught by your mother? No. Our Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because What do you call it in the south? What happened to your face. Grayscale. What would you call it in the north of the Wall? I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you? I don't remember. I was a baby. A lot of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters? My father made them move out to the keep, outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them, especially at night. They started to sound not like themselves. Did you ever see them? Only once, at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms, they acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope. What did he do with them in the woods? Mother. Leave us. Your Grace. You need to stay away from that girl. - Why? - She's a wildling. Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read. She's a wildling. Your father defeated her people. He executed their king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you. Gilly wouldn't do that. You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know. I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. The King's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If they don't fear you, they don't follow you. With respect, Your Grace, the Free Folk will never follow you no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive. Who then? You? No. Only one of their own. Do you know this wretched girl? - Lyanna Mormont. - Lord Commander's niece. Lady of Bear Island. And a child of ten. I asked her to commit her house to my court. That's her response. Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark. That amuses you. I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners commit a bit like the Free Folk. Loyal to their own. I know. My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them. Even with your father's help. Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win. - Most likely. - One pleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life gonna be like here at the Wall, - with Thorne in command? - Unpleasant, I expect. Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them. I don't doubt that, Your Grace. But I am a brother of the Night's Watch. I have pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you. You can give me the North. I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow. Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. He'll make you a Stark with a stroke of a pen. It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I daydreamed that my father would ask the king. Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again. No, you deserve that. You do. I-I couldn't be happier for you. I'm gonna refuse him. But you'd be Lord of Winterfell. I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would that be? Hey. Crowded, You'd think we were serving venison stew. Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was Acting Commander when the Wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings. Yes. He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. Nice. - He's the only true choice. - Yes. Yes. Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other Ranger. - That's right. - Through ten winters he served. As Commander of the Shadow Tower he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better. If there's no one else we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Maester Aemon Samwell Tarly, go on. Sam the Slayer. Another wildling lover, just like his friend, Jon Snow. How's your lady love, Slayer? Her name is Gilly. Ser Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall. Lies! A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there after the battle was over. In a puddle of his own making. Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children Jon Snow was leading. Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true, but when he was wounded, it was Jon who saved us. He took charge of the Wall's defense, he killed the Magnar of the Thenns, he went North to deal with Mance Rayder. Knowing it would almost certainly mean his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon. And now we've all seen it too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest. Yeah! Aye. Can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? The Night's Watch? Or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl. He spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them? It is time! Appears to be a tie, maester. Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! You! You! What have you got there? - I said - Turn around and go! Turn around - and go! - That's a nice little sword. Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that. Nothing's worth anything to dead men. Quickly, go! Go! Who are you? Why were they scared of you? You lost this. You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here. There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar. Who are you then? No one. And that is who a girl must become. _ _ _ Why? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! She should have cut the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and be done with it. That's what I keep telling her to do to you. Mhysa! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mhysa! Mhysa! L'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace. We all guard tonight. Leave me. Drogon! Shh", "summary": ["Plot Arya arrives in Braavos. Pod and Brienne run into trouble on the road. Cersei fears for her daughter's safety in Dorne as Ellaria Sand seeks revenge for Oberyn's death. Stannis tempts Jon. An adviser tempts Dany.  Summary In Braavos 5x02-01 Arya turned away from the House of Black and White.  Ternesio Terys and Arya Stark arrive at Braavos, and Arya is at first scared by the horn blown by the man inside the Titan of Braavos. The two then arrive at the House of Black and White on a boat. Arya lingers outside waiting for admittance, but is rejected by an elder man despite showing the coin Jaqen H'ghar had given her and mentioning their prior association. Arya begs the man to let her in, saying she has nowhere else to go. The old man coldly replies \"You have everywhere else to go.\" Arya waits outside the House for days, endlessly reciting the names of the people she's going to kill, but eventually tosses away her coin and wanders off into the streets of Braavos. While hunting for pigeons, she encounters several young thugs who threaten to take her food and Needle. As she prepares to defend herself, the boys scatter when the man from the House of Black and White appears again. After following him back to the House, Arya demands he divulge his identity, and he returns to her the coin she threw in the water before. He peels off his face and reveals the man Arya knew as Jaqen. Stating that \"a man is not Jaqen H'ghar,\" he responds to Arya's question as to who he really is with the answer \"No one. And that is what a girl must become\" as he indicates that Arya may now enter the House. In the Flatlands Further south, Tyrion Lannister and Varys depart Pentos in a large wheelhouse pulled by many horses. Tyrion remains despondent, and as he promised, he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor. Varys explains that they are travelling to Meereen by way of Volantis. Varys points out that Tyrion was an effective ruler when he was acting Hand of the King, and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities (a eunuch and a dwarf). They enjoyed accumulating power, he says, but they also wall themselves off from other people, like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now - but deep down they were never satisfied being separate from society. Tyrion is unmoved from his depression, and continues to insist that he's tired of being confined in a box of some sort. Varys again warns him that he must remain hidden and that it is unsafe to be seen publicly: Cersei has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head. Tyrion scoffs and rhetorically asks if Cersei is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him....  In King's Landing and the Crownlands In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister is presented with the severed head of yet another dwarf. Her offer of a lordship for Tyrion's head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as Tyrion. Cersei is irate, but won't punish the men who brought her the head for fear this will deter other such bounty hunters. She wants the head disposed of, but Qyburn interjects and politely asks if he can keep the head, as it might be of use in some of his \"experiments.\"  5x02-02 Cersei shows Jaime the \"gift\" from Dorne.  Cersei summons Jaime to their late father's office and reveals a \"gift\" from Dorne: an ornately carved viper, with Princess Myrcella's unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs. She insists it is a threat against Myrcella, a conclusion Jaime can't refute. Cersei lashes out at Jaime for not being a father to any of his children, to which he points out that if he had been, their children would be stoned in the streets. He declares he will fix the situation with Myrcella and ignores Cersei's mocking of his one-handed status. That issue dealt with, Cersei convenes the Small Council. Sitting in the Hand's seat, she announces that \"Tommen\" has declared Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers and that the position of Hand of the King will remain vacant until Tommen is old enough to decide on a candidate for himself. Tommen has apparently also decided to make Mace Tyrell the new Master of Coin in addition to his duties as Master of Ships, and extends the (just now made up) position of \"Master of War\" to Kevan Lannister. Although Mace preens at his new responsibilities, Pycelle is outraged at Qyburn's promotion (as he was thrown out of the order of Maesters for conducting human experimentation). Kevan is disgusted at Cersei's blatant power play. Refusing the new position, he denounces Cersei as nothing more than the Queen Mother, berates her for abusing her authority to fill the Small Council with her sycophants. He then walks out, saying he will await King Tommen's own instructions - at Casterly Rock.  Further north in the Crownlands at Castle Stokeworth, Bronn is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed Lollys Stokeworth. They seem to get on relatively well, but when Lollys reminds Bronn that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies, he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what's coming to them, clearly setting his sights on the castle. Jaime finds the couple, and reveals to Bronn that Cersei has reneged on her deal and offered Lollys's hand to Ser Willas Bracken instead. Bronn is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until Jaime tells him that if he helps rescue Myrcella from Dorne, Bronn will receive a much better girl than Lollys, who has rights to a much better castle.  In Dorne 5x02-03 Ellaria and Doran discuss Oberyn's death.  In the Water Gardens of Dorne, Ellaria Sand rudely demands an audience with Doran Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne. His bodyguard, Areo Hotah, blocks her path, yet Doran tells him to let her pass. She wants to take Princess Myrcella, who at that very moment is enjoying Trystane Martell's company, so that she can send the princess piece by piece to Cersei as revenge for Oberyn Martell's murder. Doran refuses, reminding her that Oberyn had participated in a trial by combat, and therefore his death was legal, and not murder. He states Dorne will not stoop to the level of mutilating children while he rules, even if the Sand Snakes are siding with Ellaria. Sneering, Ellaria asks how long he expects to rule for and storms out. Hotah and the Prince exchange a look as she departs, the former meaningfully indicating his axe, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the Water Gardens as he contemplates his next move. In the Vale Brienne and Podrick arrive at an inn and dine. Podrick spots Sansa Stark with Petyr Baelish, and Brienne tells him to ready the horses and she confronts them.  Brienne swears to Sansa. Brienne swears to Sansa.  Brienne mentions her sworn vow to Sansa's mother Catelyn, while Littlefinger points out how she was accused of murdering Renly Baratheon and how both he and Catelyn are now dead. Sansa denies Brienne's request and Littlefinger urges that she stay at the inn as the road is not safe, and seeing this as a trap, Brienne escapes with Podrick on the horses they take. They are chased through a forest as Brienne fights the men and Podrick is thrown off his horse. Reuniting, Podrick mentions how both Stark girls denied her request for protection, but Brienne retorts by doubting Sansa is safe with Littlefinger. Brienne tells Podrick to get his horse as they attempt to further pursue Sansa and Littlefinger.  In Meereen 5x02-04 Barristan Selmy tells Daenerys the truth about her father, the Mad King.  Daario and Grey Worm find a house belonging to a Son of the Harpy allegedly responsible for White Rat's death. Daario explains that he has been using the Second Sons as spies throughout Meereen, since they are far less conspicuous than Unsullied and can indulge in the same vices as their informants; Daario indicates his men's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall, seriously injuring the man hiding behind it. Back at the Great Pyramid, Daenerys and her council debate executing this Harpy's Son, but the debate devolves into a shouting match between Mossador and Hizdahr zo Loraq. After the rest leave, Ser Barristan tells her about her father, and confirms that, contrary to what Viserys told her, the Mad King was indeed quite mad, citing how his crimes against House Stark ultimately led to the rebellion that all but destroyed the Targaryen dynasty. Mollified by the revelation, particularly that her crazed father always thought his atrocities were serving justice to his enemies, Daenerys promises Ser Barristan that there will be a trial for the accused. Before the trial begins, Mossador kills the Harpy's Son. Daenerys, hoping to preserve the integrity of law, has Mossador publicly executed, causing the freed slaves to hiss at her and throw rocks at her as she leaves, along with a riot between the former slaves and masters breaking out.  Later that night, Daenerys dismisses her council and goes outside. To her relief, Drogon, now the size of a small house, has alighted just above her balcony. Drogon sniffs her outstretched hand, and though he doesn't attack, he flies away again, leaving his mother alone.  At the Wall Shireen Baratheon teaches Gilly how to read in Castle Black's library, apparently to Sam's chagrin. Gilly asks about Shireen's Greyscale scars, revealing that the wildlings don't really have a word for it and that two of her sisters contracted and were driven mad by the disease, before Craster put them out of their misery. Queen Selyse interrupts the proceedings and dismisses Sam and Gilly. She lectures Shireen on the dangers of spending time with any wildlings, since they could conceivably use Gilly to harm Stannis through Shireen. Shireen, however, doubts that that's how things will go.  Lyanna Mormont&#039;s letter \"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.\" - Lyanna Mormont, ten year old Lady of Bear Island.  Stannis himself, meanwhile, discusses Jon Snow's recent defiance. Stannis shows Jon a message he received from Lady Lyanna Mormont in response to the demand that House Mormont pledge itself to Stannis's cause. The note refuses, saying that the Mormonts know only one king, the King in the North, and will only follow a Stark. Jon tells Stannis that, like the Wildlings, the Northerners will only follow one of their own. Realizing this is true, Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer: if he leaves the Night's Watch, Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell, so he can rally the North to Stannis's side and resume the fight against the Boltons, Freys, and Lannisters. Jon is visibly moved at the prospect of having his lifelong dream finally come true, but he later admits to Sam that he plans to turn Stannis down: he is a man of the Night's Watch.  The Choosing for the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch commences, overseen by Maester Aemon. Janos Slynt nominates Alliser Thorne. Another brother names Denys Mallister, Commander of the Shadow Tower. The vote almost begins before Sam interrupts to put forward a third nomination: Jon Snow. When the votes are cast, a tie is called: Snow and Thorne have garnered an equal number of votes. With a wry smile, Maester Aemon casts his own vote for Jon Snow. The black brothers hail Jon as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."], "review": null}, "43": {"id": "s05e03", "name": "High Sparrow", "script": "Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris. I've been sweeping this floor for days. Good. I didn't come here to sweep floors. No? Why come, then? You said I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to be a Faceless Man. A man teaches a girl. Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless Men most of all. I want to serve. A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God. To serve well, a girl must become no one. Which one's the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the weirwood face. There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift. Where are they taking him? Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! -  I am his and he is mine. -  I am hers and she is mine. From this day until the end of my days. Did I hurt you? No. You were lovely. - It all happened so fast. - Yes. I was scared maybe I hurt you. - It sounded like-- - No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived. This is all I want to do all day, every day, for the rest of my life. Wouldn't that be glorious? Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath? There's no rush, is there? Of course not. Are you hungry? Should I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice? No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen, First of His Name. King Tommen. Still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you? So strange. - Husband. - Wife. Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, and it's all because my brother died. I understand. But it's not your fault. You know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty. I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd. Do you like to sail? I love to sail. I do, too. I think we're going to be very happy, you and I. I do, too. Living in a tower so high it touches the clouds. Of course, my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital's not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here? I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing. It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guarding her cub. Well, but I'm a man now. You are. And the king. But you'll always be her baby boy. - I suppose. -  I adore her. She's always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horrors she's had to endure-- losing her husband, her eldest child, and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight. You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll. She smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters. Do you ever miss Casterly Rock? There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock. That's where you grew up. You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk. Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock? The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it, that you-- that it was your real home. This is my real home now, where my family lives. I want you to be happy, Mother. I know that. I know you do. My sweet boy. But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock? I said, \"Darling, surely four times is enough.\" \"Are you trying to set a new record?\" He said, \"Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.\" Mother. Welcome. Don't you look lovely? Marriage agrees with you. Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us. No, no, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if there's ever anything I can do for you You are very sweet. Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen. I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful. Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy. Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest. But what could I expect? He is half lion, half stag. I'll leave you to it, then. Oh, forgive me. I haven't been at court for long. I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen? There's no need for such formalities. In any event, judging from the king's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon. Won't that be a lovely day? Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night. Remember anything you need. We can't hold the North with terror alone. You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us. I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies. Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark and he'd be damned if he'd kiss a traitor's boot. He left you no choice. I flayed him living along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch. And? The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes. I've something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen. We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other houses rise up against us. Do you understand that? Our pact with the Lannisters protects-- I had a pact with Tywin Lannister. And Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We've become a great house by entering into alliances with other houses and parlaying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's high time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I've found the perfect girl to solidify our hold on the North. That's Moat Cailin. Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before? On our way down to King's Landing with my father and Arya. Where are you taking me? Home. The Boltons have Winterfell. Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you. No. Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family. He did. He serves the Lannisters. For now. - I won't go. - Winterfell is your home. - Not anymore. - Always. You're a Stark. Dying your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North. I can't marry him. You can't make me. He is a traitor. A murderer! You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you-- - No. - Sansa. No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there. I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses around, but listen to me. Listen. You've been running all your life. Terrible things happen to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them. Banners! How do we get through there? We don't. We go around. Takes us miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them. Doesn't matter. I know where they're going. Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp? He hates that nickname. Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he? I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night he had a bit too much to drink and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham. He borrowed it? He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk, too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out under a wagon with the hambone still in his hand. They hanged him that afternoon. They tied the noose for me, too, but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne, so he pardoned me and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son. As punishment for both of you. It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me. Yes, all your lords have been very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you had to squire for such a nasty person. I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat the Hound. I'm proud to be your squire. I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you. If you didn't snap at me, I wouldn't learn anything. You want to be a knight, Pod? Yes. Starting tomorrow, we'll train with a sword twice a day. Before we ride in the morning and after you make camp in the evening. - And I'm going to show you how to ride properly. - Thank you. I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight. I suppose that's more important. You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you? I was. Lord Tyrion said he was a good man. He was. How did you end up serving Renly? When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wanted to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. They shoved each other and threatened to duel when they thought it was their turn to dance. They whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I had never been so happy. Till I saw a few of the boys snickering. And then they all started to laugh. They couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. \"Brienne the Beauty\" they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. \"Don't let them see your tears,\" he told me. \"They're nasty little shits and nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.\" He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. Renly was the king's brother after all. But wasn't he? Lord Tyrion said he was Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me. He didn't want me. He danced with me because he was kind and didn't want to see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day I will avenge King Renly. But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow? A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed. - Lord Commander. - Your Grace. I'd like to speak alone. Olly is my steward now as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience. One day he might command. Very well. Have you considered my offer? I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark. Say the word and you will be. But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here. I'm giving you the chance to avenge your family, to take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North. I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch. You're as stubborn as your father. I can imagine no higher praise. I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. But if your mind's made up, I won't try and dissuade you. May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black? Are you bored of us already? You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming. I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight, before the snows trap us here. And the wildlings? If they'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them. That's the safest course. Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead. Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. You're the Lord Commander. Your decision. You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. I heard it was best to keep your enemies close. Whoever said that didn't have many enemies. He sees something in you. Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you. I'm sorry I disappointed him. The king is a complicated man, but he wants to do what's right for the Seven Kingdoms. As long as he's ruling them. He's the one true king. He has a blood right to that throne. I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms. Have you now? How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I'll bet you've got it memorized since you got here. Night gathers and now my watch begins. No, not that bit. The bit at the end. I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. -  I pledge my life-- - Right, that's enough. The shield that guards the realms of men. That's what you swore to be. Now, I'm not a learned man, but the best way to help the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be done. And what needs to be done? As long as the Boltons rule the North, the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion. What do you want? Who are you? - What? - You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned whose value you do not respect. Who are you? No one. Ow! Cunt! A lie. A sad little lie. Who are you? I told you, I'm no-- Do that again, and-- Who are you? You're about to find out. What are you doing? We were only playing. The Game of Faces. - A girl is not ready. - Clearly not. I am ready! For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one. Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things. What do we do with them after we wash them? Open gate! Honor guard, stand to! Hold up. Easy. Lady Sansa. Welcome. Lord Bolton. May I introduce my son Ramsay Bolton? It's an honor to meet you, my lady. I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash. Thank you. Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers. Sam? Maester Aemon? He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well. Take good care of him. Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger. - That's him! - That's him. Ser Alliser. You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black. You proved your valor many times over while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger. Hear, hear! Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard. Greyguard is a ruin. Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare 10 of his-- I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin. All right, all right! Enough of that. You mistake me, my lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armor, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard. I will not go meekly off to freeze and die. Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Did you hear me, boy? I will not have it! Are you refusing to obey my order? You can stick your order up your bastard ass. Take Lord Janos outside. Olly, bring me my sword. - Get out. - You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken. Yes, very mistaken. Disgrace! I have friends. Important friends in the capital. - You'll see. - Kneel! If you have any last words, my lord, now's the time. I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander. We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong. My lord, please! Mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid. You have served us well, my son. Thank you, Father. Which of the Seven will you worship today? - The Maiden. - Always the Maiden. And the Stranger. - Two is extra, you realize? - Yes, yes. What are you doing? This establishment belongs to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't-- You have profaned our faith, the faith of our fathers and forefathers. I am the High Septon of the-- You are a sinner. And you shall be punished. Ah! - Sinner. - Sinner. - Sinner. Sinner. - Repent! Sinner. Sinner. Sinner. Sinner. - Shame on you. - Sinner. Sinner. Your Grace, Grand Maester, Lord Tyrell, uh It doesn't matter. As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven, I give voice to the will of the gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the gods. An assault on my person is an assault on our very religion. - You were assaulted? - I was. By those fanatics who call themselves sparrows. They humiliated me, they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive. I heard this assault began in Littlefinger's brothel. High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear. I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother. So you were ministering to the needs of these devout prostitutes? A man's private affairs ought to stay private. What do you want from us, High Septon? Justice. I ask that you protect our faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. - If he goes unpunished-- - And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow? I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace. Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. Where can I find the High Sparrow? Seven blessings. - Thank you. - Just a little more. Thank you. Thank you. A young man said I'd find the High Sparrow back here. - Where is he? - High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle. Still, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. The notion that we're all equal in the eyes of the Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me. Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name. Quite an easy burden to bear. Far easier than hers. Why no shoes? Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are. Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone? Everyone? Hard enough job reminding myself. Well, I tell them no one's special and they think I'm special for telling them so. Perhaps they're right. It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? Have the gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me for that incident with the High Septon. An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the gods in this world, wouldn't you say? Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a boil is never pleasant. Although they could have been more careful with the blade. The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you. He wants me to execute you. I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter. My thoughts on the matter are in line with your own. The High Septon's behavior was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the sept eats away at the faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep dungeons instead. The faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another. - Your Grace. -  Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger at the Eyrie or wherever he's slithering about. At once, Your Grace. How's your work coming along? Very well. You've made progress? More than I expected. - Still a way to go, but - Very good. I'll leave you to it, then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word \"immediately.\" Shh. Easy, friend. She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy. I hope so, too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough. I'll never hurt her. You have my word. I've heard very little about you, which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go. I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard. And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish. Yes, Father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. He seems pleased. Shouldn't he be? I assure you, she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she is no man's wife. Inspect her if you must. I'll leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue. Then I have delivered everything I promised. And you're prepared for the consequences when the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay? The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies. Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear. The queen will be enraged. Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day. And yet she still has friends, men in important places whom she can ask for favors. A message for you from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from the Eyrie shortly before dawn. Apparently she thinks you're still in the Vale. A message for me you say? Strange that the seal is broken. I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you receive word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros, yet here you are in the North undermining them. Why gamble with your position? Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North. I had Tywin Lannister's backing. Who supports me now? You? The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply. I'd like to read the reply. I have to get out of this wheelhouse. Volantis is a large city. I have to get out of this wheelhouse. The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold. Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse. I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this. I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours. It's a perfectly good face. I am losing my mind. If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that. Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. What am I? One more drunk dwarf. Whoa! We have to go now. Come on, hold it. Hold it. Are you ready? Slaves. Yes, the Volantene masters are very organized. Flies for dung shovelers. Hammers for builders. Tears for whores. Lest they forget. _ _ We should keep moving. _ _ _ The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better-looking. _ _ Stone Men. Good luck stopping the spread of greyscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. Shh. _ _ We're going to meet the savior. You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the savior? Come on. Let's find a brothel. Build your house in a day. _ It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock. See? We blend right in. Just two more travelers mad with lust. Thank you. What curious hair. The Mother of Dragons! It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter. We were just heading east to see you. I've got a dragon for you. How much to make him spit fire? Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously. What makes you worth that much? - I'm magic. - I'll bet you bloody are. Well, she's taken. Where are you going? I need to speak to someone with hair. - Hello. - Hello. - You've got no drink. - You've got no money. Do I look like a man without money? Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. Who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? I always pay my debts. I'm well known for it. You like her. They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen. That's because they've never met a queen. You're just saying that. You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you. Why? Because you have a skeptical mind. All right, then. I'm warning you, we're going to have to wash you first. Come on. I'm-- I'm sorry, I can't. Of course you can. You're shy. I'm not. Have another drink. Gladly, but this I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? Go for a piss. That's a start. No need to worry. I was just-- Oh, I thought you were someone else. Show's almost over. I'm sure there are girls inside who'd be happy to oblige. You've made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you're doing and then-- I'm taking you to the queen.", "summary": ["Plot In Braavos, Arya sees the Many-Faced God. In King's Landing, Queen Margaery enjoys her new husband. Tyrion and Varys walk the Long Bridge of Volantis.  Summary In King's Landing Margaery-Tommen-Wedding Tommen and Margaery are wed.  As Cersei Lannister passes a large crowd on her way to the Great Sept of Baelor, she is increasingly annoyed as people cheer on Margaery, completely ignoring her. Tommen Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell are wed, much to the dismay of Cersei. That night, they consummate their marriage. They are elated and discuss their future together. Tommen thinks that his mother is unhappy in King's Landing. Seeing an opportunity, Margaery manipulates Tommen into thinking that as long as Cersei stays in King\u2019s Landing, she will continue to treat him like a child, watching over him. The next morning, Tommen and Cersei are out for a walk. Tommen tells his mother that he thinks she should return to Casterly Rock if it will make her happy, since she used to talk so fondly of it, but Cersei declines. Deducing that this is Margaery\u2019s doing, Cersei pays her a visit, to find Margaery busy gloating about her \u201cexhausting\u201d night with the King. Greeting her mother-in-law, Margaery is now more confident than ever and subtly rubs her queenship in Cersei\u2019s face. Seeing herself losing, Cersei walks away. In Littlefinger's brothel, the Sparrows attack the High Septon as he engages the services of prostitutes dressed as the Seven. He is forced to walk naked through the streets while the Sparrows proclaim him a sinner. Angered by the humiliation, he wants the Small Council to arrest the Sparrows and execute their leader, the High Sparrow. Although unsympathetic, Cersei decides to meet with the High Sparrow, who turns out to be a humble man serving food to the poor, barefoot. The High Sparrow makes no efforts to hide the actions of the other Sparrows. Cersei tells him that he will not be arrested or executed, and that the High Septon has been imprisoned instead, which surprises the High Sparrow. Returning to the Red Keep, Cersei has Qyburn send a message to Petyr Baelish. As Qyburn writes, behind him, the body of Gregor Clegane begins shaking under the sheet, but Qyburn shushes him calmly.  In the North While being served lunch by Reek, Roose Bolton scolds Ramsay on his recent flaying of Lord Cerwyn and his family on what was supposed to be a routine tax collection. Ramsay points out that he eventually got the taxes, but Roose reminds his son that terror cannot sustain their hold on the North and that they are outnumbered if the other houses rise up in rebellion. With Tywin Lannister's death, the pact between the Lannisters and the Boltons is effectively dead. Roose then declares that the best way to cement Bolton control of the North is through marriage.  Sansa Stark is horrified to see Moat Cailin. There is only one reason Baelish could be taking her there - he means to return her to Winterfell, straight into the arms of the Boltons. Recalling their earlier discussion of a marriage proposal, Sansa realizes that the proposal is not for him, but for her, and furiously declares that she would rather die than marry Roose Bolton. Littlefinger corrects her and clarifies that she will be marrying Ramsay Bolton, then calms her down by convincing her that nobody will look for her there, and suggests that this is her best opportunity for revenge. Sansa reluctantly agrees.  House Bolton Season 5 promo pic The Boltons greet Sansa and Baelish  At Winterfell itself, the Boltons and their households greet Sansa and Littlefinger. After a tense moment, Sansa graciously accepts Roose's welcome, putting on an air of politeness that protected her in King's Landing, while from afar, Ramsay's bedwarmer and secret lover, Myranda, observes with jealousy and anger. Sansa is later shown to her old room, seemingly foreign to her after all this time. To her surprise, the servant attending her welcomes her back and quietly assures her that, \"the North remembers.\" Later, as Sansa explores the castle, Reek hides his face from her, but seems to have difficulty forcing himself not to call out to her. Elsewhere in the castle, Baelish subtly warns Ramsay against inflicting any harm on Sansa, and discusses the situation with Roose, who is suspicious of Littlefinger's motives in betraying the Lannisters. Baelish points out that Tywin is dead, Jaime is one-handed and politically useless, and that Cersei is about to be forced into the background by Margaery, who is quite fond of Sansa. Bolton, nevertheless, demands to read any messages Littlefinger might send off back to the Capital.  At the Wall King Stannis Baratheon tries unsuccessfully to convince the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Jon Snow, to accept his offer of legitimization. Jon declines Stannis's offer and reiterates that his place is with the Night's Watch. Jon also reiterates the Night's Watch's neutrality in the affairs of the Seven Kingdoms and asks Stannis when he plans to leave; Castle Black's stores are insufficient to feed the Night's Watch, Stannis's army, and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Stannis confirms that his army will leave soon enough to confront the Boltons at Winterfell before the winter snows trap them at the Wall. He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in Jon's hands, allowing Jon to decide whether to execute them or to see if Tormund is more willing to negotiate than Mance. When Stannis suggests appointing Alliser Thorne as the new commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Jon retorts that \"it is better to have your enemies close by than far away.\" As Davos Seaworth prepares to leave with his liege, he invites Jon to ponder on the second-to-last stanza on the Night's Watch oath: \"I am the shield that guards the realms of men.\" He also assures Jon that Stannis's leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him.  Later, at the mess hall, Lord Commander Jon Snow asks Sam about Maester Aemon and it is learned his health is waning and entrusts his care in Sam's hands. Jon begins assigning roles to members of the Watch. He assigns one black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit to accommodate the wildling prisoners; he jokes that it 'seems like a good job for a ginger,' which the brother takes with a grin and laughs with the others. Snow also shows respect to Ser Alliser Thorne by appointing him as the new First Ranger, commending his experience. Finally, Lord Commander Snow assigns Janos Slynt with the task of restoring and manning the abandoned castle Greyguard. Slynt refuses Jon not once, but three times. Even after it's clarified to be an order, not an offer, and being warned that he is disobeying a direct order, he flippantly tells Jon that he can take his order and 'shove it up his bastard arse.' Having been publicly disobeyed and insulted by him, the Lord Commander orders Janos taken outside, and calls for Olly to fetch him his sword. Ser Alliser briefly hesitates but then moves out of the way to let Dolorous Edd and others grab Slynt, who angrily protests that he has important friends at court and dismisses the matter as a scare tactic.  Small justice for Ned Small justice for Ned Stark.  Jon has Janos dragged out into the courtyard where, obedient to the laws of his father Eddard Stark - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - he prepares to publicly behead him for treason. Slynt's bluster is lost, and the man who once took a baby girl from her mother's arms and killed her starts crying and begging for mercy, saying he will do whatever Jon asks and that he has always been afraid. Jon hesitates for a moment, but then fixes his nerve and executes the cowardly former Commander of the City Watch with a single swing of Longclaw - incidentally exacting small justice on one of the men who betrayed his own father to his death and murdered Robert Baratheon's children. From across the courtyard, Stannis Baratheon sees Jon behead Janos for refusing his orders, and slightly nods in approval.  In Braavos Arya-attacked Arya is accosted by The Waif  In Braavos, Arya Stark has been put to work cleaning the main sanctuary of the House of Black and White. She watches as Jaqen H'ghar assists a supplicant in drinking from the temple's well. She protests to Jaqen that she wants to learn, but he brushes off her discontent. Later on, Arya is accosted in her room by The Waif, who repeatedly asks her who she is, hitting her when she gives the expected response of \"no one.\" Jaqen eventually arrives and demands to know what is going on, as the Waif has overstepped her bounds. He does, however, point out that Arya cannot be 'no one', as she is wearing Arya Stark's clothes, is in possession of silver stolen by Arya Stark, and was about to attack the Waif using Arya Stark's sword. Realizing his point, Arya binds her old clothing to a rock and tosses it into the lagoon along with the stolen silver. She cannot bring herself to discard Needle so easily, and instead hides it within a seawall nearby. Back at the House, Jaqen allows Arya to progress to an inner chamber where she is to assist the Waif in stripping and washing corpses. The Waif is silent when Arya asks what happens to the bodies after they are cleaned. In Volantis Volantis-Red Priestess The Red Priestess  Meanwhile, further south in the Free Cities, Tyrion Lannister and Varys finally arrive at Volantis. Sick of the carriage they've been riding in, Tyrion again dismisses the dangers and insists they leave to explore. The pair move through the Long Bridge's markets, where Varys explains the meaning of the various tattoos Volantene slaves must sport. Varys nearly loses Tyrion, but finds him observing the sermon of a Red Priestess. Tyrion says he is curious, since Thoros of Myr was the only Red Priest in King's Landing. The Red Priestess evangelizes in High Valyrian, telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself. Like another Red Priestess, she preaches of a prophesied savior, a Dragon Queen. Tyrion's interest in the scene wanes when the Priestess halts in her sermon and stares directly into his eyes.  Tyrion next leads Varys to a brothel. Catching sight of a prostitute dressed as Daenerys, Varys tells Tyrion that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting. Tyrion woos a dark-haired prostitute, but when she finally agrees to service him, he finds that he can't bring himself to patronize her. He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge, with Varys losing sight of him. As Tyrion finishes, he is abducted by Jorah Mormont, who declares that he is taking him to \"the queen.\" "], "review": null}, "44": {"id": "s05e04", "name": "Sons of the Harpy", "script": "Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She was my sister. This is where she belongs. The Boltons have Winterfell. You'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. You loved your family. Avenge them. Does your mother like it here? So wonderful to have her watching over you. But you'll always be her baby boy. I want you to be happy, Mother. But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock? Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet? Everybody knows everything about everyone. Where can I find the High Sparrow? The High Septon's behavior was corrosive. Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a boil is never pleasant. You shall be punished. We must protect one another. Myrcella is in Dorne, surrounded by people who hate our family. Your brother was murdered. Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. The Sand Snakes are with me. They will avenge their father while you sit here, doing nothing. I'm bringing our daughter home. A one-handed man? Alone? Who said I was going alone? Conquerors always meet with resistance. Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on all of our necks. All they understand is blood. Volantis is a large city. The likelihood of you being spotted here increases tenfold. I'm taking you to the Queen. Is that Estermont? Tarth, Ser Jaime. The Sapphire Isle. Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails? This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier not far from Sunspear, row ourselves to the Dornish shore in the night. You ever been to Dorne? - No. - I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck, fuck and fight. You should be happy to go back. There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting, I'm sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess. We're not kidnapping their princess. We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back to her family. Your niece? I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. - I'm good at it. - That's why you're here. I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me? Or an army? Unlike most folks, you've actually got one. Because I don't want to start a war. That still doesn't explain what you're doing here. It has to be me. If I'm putting something like this together, a one-handed man who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not-- It has to be me. You set your brother free, didn't you? I'll bet your sister didn't like that. Varys set him free. Well, if you ever see the wee fucker, give him my regards. He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards. The Iron Bank has called in one-tenth of the crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal fleet-- How much can the crown afford? With winter coming, half what they ask, less? You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them? House Tyrell could front the gold and the crown would pay us back in time or I'd have words with my daughter. You've already given us too much. No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank. - Absolutely. - In person. - Me? - We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance to show these bankers our respect. As the king's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified. I would be honored, Your Grace. The king's expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort. My very own Kingsguard? - Please express my-- - Safe travels, Lord Tyrell. Of course. Of course. I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos. The small council grows smaller and smaller. Not small enough. May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness? No. The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is I don't like the taste. Hmm. How may I serve? All over Westeros we hear of septs being burned, Silent Sisters raped, bodies of holy men piled in the streets. Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the gods. Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own. In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven. Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago. If I explain their holy purpose to my son the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy. An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people? An army in service to the gods themselves. And to you, of course, as the chosen representative of the Seven. An honor I never expected. Or, indeed, ever wished for. Which is why you were chosen. You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most. All sinners are equal before the gods. What would you say if I told you of a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege. May the Father judge him justly. What are you doing? Help me! Help me! Yeah. Yeah. Get off me! Come on. Shut up! Move! This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment. Cocksuckers. Boy fucker. You buggering filth! There's a special place in the seventh hell for your kind. Please. Please, I'll pay. I'll-- I'll pay all of you. Yes, you will. Seize him. Sinner. Get your hands off me. Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of gods and men. Who do you think you are? Justice. Why is my brother in a cell? I-I don't know. I-I didn't order it. We both know who did. You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock. Are you saying my mother's behind this? She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge. Aren't you and Mother getting along? Oh, my sweet, sweet king. Do you have any affection for me at all? Of course I do. You're my queen. I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell. I'll set him free for you. Do you promise? I demand that Ser Loras be freed now. Did I arrest him? Well, no. But y-you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army. I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. We can't allow fanatics to arrest the queen's brother no matter his perversions. Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released? I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras. You're the king. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy. Halt! His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed. Give the order and we'll clear out this rabble. You mean, kill them? Here at the sept? You'd be sending them to meet the gods that they love. Bastard! You're an abomination! Born of sin! Filthy bastard! We'll find another way. Abomination! My queen? There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence. You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm, and you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law. I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow. Are you? When? - I-I don't know. - You don't know? He was praying just now. I have to send word to Grandmother. Will you come back later? I need to be with my family, Your Grace. Of course. You think highly of this boy? Good. Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. And a bastard by some tavern slut. Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way. I should have given you a son. Not your fault. Whose, then? I gave you nothing but weakness. And deformity. Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light. My lady. Her father is the Lord's chosen king, and her father's blood runs through her veins. You march on Winterfell soon? We must to beat the snows. Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again. I won't. I need you. You only need faith, my king. And you, my lady, what do you need? To serve my Lord. Lord Ashford. Lady Caulfield. Oh, Lord Smallwood. I've never even heard of these people. They haven't heard of you, either. But we need men and they have some. How many men does this Lord Mayzen have to send us? More than Lord Wibberley. - Not him. -  I know, I'm sorry. But we need men and supplies and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North. He murdered my brother. We swore to be the watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North. Apologies, my lady. Lord Commander. How can I help you? Come with us when we ride south. None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? Castle Black is my home now. The Night's Watch take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms. There's only one war. Life against death. Come, let me show you what you're fighting for. You're gonna show me some vision in the fire? Forgive me, my lady, I don't trust in visions. No visions. No magic. Just life. Do you feel my heart beating? There's power in you. You resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it. The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. In our joining, there's power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows. I don't think Stannis would like that very much. Then we shouldn't tell him. - I can't. - Why? I swore a vow. I loved another. The dead don't need lovers. Only the living. I know. But I still love her. You know nothing, Jon Snow. Are you lonely? Just bored. My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources. Were you bored a lot, too? I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but-- I like it. I thought I'd be left at home. I know Mother didn't want to bring me. Why do you say that? She told me, \"I don't want to bring you.\" She shouldn't have said that. Are you ashamed of me, Father? When you were an infant, a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He had even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house. No doubt he had heard of your birth and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle. How you pressed it to your cheek. By the time we burned the doll, it was too late. I was told you would die. Or worse, the greyscale would go slow. Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone Men before the sickness spread through the castle. I told them all to go to hell. I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer. Every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. 'Cause you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone Men. You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter. I thought I might find you here. Your Aunt Lyanna. Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful. I saw her once. I was a boy living with your mother's family. Lord Whent held a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon, and Lyanna. She was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for their prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt? Yes, he chose her. And then he kidnapped her and raped her. Come. Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. You're dressed for riding. I am. Where are you going? King's Landing. King's Landing? Cersei sent for me. We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble. You can't leave me here. I know how hard it is to live with people you despise. Believe me. But it won't be for long. How do you know? Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first he has to take Winterfell. - You don't know that. - I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons, he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne. You think he'll defeat the Boltons? He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. As it happens, I am a betting man. And if you're right? Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support of his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North. But I-- I wouldn't-- Wardeness of the North? You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you. And what if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell? Or he does and the Boltons defeat him? Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours. I don't know how to do that. Of course you do. He's already fallen for you. His father frightens me. He should. He's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learned to maneuver from the very best. I'll return before too long. You'll be strong without me. The North will be yours. Do you believe me? I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return. Breakfast. That would have been a shit way to die. As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die. Aye, but your lot have to give the singers a good ending. I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead. No? Two knights off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me. Sounds like all the rest. What about you? What shit way would you choose? In my own keep drinking my own wine watching my sons grovel for my fortune. How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned. I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go? In the arms of the woman I love. She want the same thing? Let's go. The captain of that ship-- what was he, Braavosi? Pentoshi. And he's headed to Oldtown? As I said. Why? What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne? A bag of gold. I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world. It was a heavy bag. And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks 'em. How many you count? Four. How many do you think you can take? One if he's slow. Halt! Over the hill. Fucked in the ass. Hyah! Morning, lads. Glad we found you. Who are you? Cooper. This is Darnell. You're from King's Landing. Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom, whelped and whipped. Why are you here? Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really. Thought the sharks would get us. There are no sharks in Dorne. Could have sworn those were shark fins. Dolphins, maybe. Throw your swords in the sand. Boys, there's no need for this. Just point us in the right direction, we'll find our way home. Swords in the sand now. Hyah! Hyah! That one should be slow enough. Nice move. Luck. You had a wonderful teacher. Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our faces. First we need to bury these bodies. Birds have to eat, too. Corpses raise questions. Questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war. Do you know how long it'll take us to dig all those holes? I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really. Mama. Nym, Obara. Will it be war? Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves. Without Doran, we have no army to march against the Lannisters. We don't need an army to start a war. Queen Cersei loves her children. And we have one of them. You may have a problem. A ship's captain who found me in Planky Town claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne. He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war. I'm with you always. Nym? Obara? When I was a child, Oberyn came to take me to court. I had never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young and a girl. Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, \"Girl or boy, we fight our battles, but the gods let us choose our weapons.\" My father pointed to the spear and then to my mother's tears. I made my choice long ago. Will you untie me? Will you please untie me? Will you please? Thank you. Who are you? Your captor. Do you have wine? No. Can't sleep without wine. Then stay awake. You're going the wrong way. My sister is in Westeros. Westeros is west. We're heading east. I'm not taking you to your sister. You said you were taking me to the queen. I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the queen I serve. What a waste of a good kidnapping. It so happens I was heading there myself. What business would you have with the queen? Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you'd ever met my sister, you'd understand. So, now that it's clear we are on the same side A highborn knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask. How exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away? Is it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait. You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me. I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out and exiled you. Now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. Risky scheme. One might even say desperate. You think Daenerys will execute me and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely. Everyone looks happy enough from up here. What? I was thinking about all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep into the streets of King's Landing. - Why? - He liked to walk among the people. He liked to sing to them. He sang to them? Yes. Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels. And what did you do? I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. What? He liked to see how much he could make. - He was good? - He was very good. Viserys never told you? He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing. And what did you do with the money? Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time, we got horribly drunk. Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in the audience chamber. How many others are there? Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan? I think I can protect you from Hizdahr zo Loraq. I think I can protect me from Hizdahr zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me. Your Grace. All men must die, but not all can die in glory. - Glory? - Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have. Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport? Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season. I do not recognize this tradition. Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start. _", "summary": ["Plot The Faith Militant grow increasingly aggressive. Jaime and Bronn head south.

Summary In King's Landing At a Small Council meeting, Master of Coin Mace Tyrell brings bad news that the Iron Bank of Braavos is starting to call in its debts from Westeros. They have started by calling in a tenth of the Iron Throne's current debts to the bank, which it can only afford half of as rebuilding the Royal Fleet was also a massive expense. Mace offers that House Tyrell could front the money for the time being, but Cersei clearly does not want to give the Tyrells more power over the crown. Instead, she says that they will send Mace himself to Braavos to negotiate for more time, because sending such a high-ranking official will show the bank how seriously they take their large debts. Mace is oblivious that this is also Cersei's way of removing him from the capital, and takes it as a high honor - as well as that Cersei will send Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard along to \"guard\" him. After he leaves, Pycelle bitterly points out that the Small Council is growing even smaller (the only three members left in the capital are Pycelle, Cersei, and her lackey Qyburn), but she says it hasn't quite grown small enough yet.  Cersei high sparrow Sons of the Harpy Cersei meets with the High Sparrow.  Cersei then meets with the High Sparrow, who by her influence, has been elected as the new High Septon of the Faith of the Seven. Cersei is trying to build up a new alliance between the Crown and the Faith, as a counterweight to the large political influence the Tyrells now possess. Cersei points out to the High Sparrow that the War of the Five Kings has devastated much of the countryside, resulting in septs being burned, clergymen attacked, and even Silent Sisters raped. Bodies of holy men are piling up in the streets. The High Sparrow admits that wars make men obey the sword more than the gods. Cersei points out that before the Targaryens, the military order known as the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven. The High Septon is confused, as the Targaryens disbanded the Faith Militant over two centuries ago. Cersei explains that, as part of the new alliance she hopes to build between the Crown and the Faith, she will tell her son to repeal the law and allow the Faith Militant to be reestablished and re-armed: an army whose purpose is to defend the Faith, holy men, and the smallfolk - and which will incidentally be turned against the Crown's enemies. She then advises him that there is a great sinner in their midst who has been shielded by gold and power. The High Sparrow replies with a wish for The Father to judge him justly.  The new Faith Militant storm the streets of King's Landing, attacking taverns, brothels, and street vendors selling idols from other religions. The City Watch look on, helpless, and do not intervene. They ransack Littlefinger's brothel, dragging prostitutes like Marei out into the street by their hair. Olyvar is struck and ignored as they barge in. Olyvar hears screams coming from another room which he approaches to see the Sparrows have singled out a male client having sex with one of the male prostitutes. The Sparrows had assaulted the customer and prostitute with knives and hurled homophobic slurs against them. One Sparrow approaches one of the men with a knife. Olyvar flees as one of the men screams off-screen. As a sign of their zealotry, the Faith Militant have the Seven-Pointed Star symbol of the Faith carved into their foreheads - including Lancel, who leads a squad of the Faith Militant to apprehend Loras Tyrell while he is sparring in the practice yard. Lancel proclaims that Loras' sexual perversions are sins against the laws of gods and men, and Loras is dragged off. Margaery Tyrell is furious at Tommen for her brother's arrest, then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to Loras. Tommen then goes to his mother and, briefly standing up to her, demands that Loras be released at once. Cersei calmly points out that she didn't arrest Loras, the Faith Militant simply dragged him off and imprisoned him, so he should ask the High Sparrow to release him. Tommen naively thinks the High Sparrow will simply do as he requests, so he heads to the Great Sept of Baelor with five Kingsguard and several Lannister guards. The path to the Great Sept is blocked by the Faith Militant, who say that the High Sparrow is praying and does not wish to be disturbed. The Kingsguard request that Tommen let them kill the Faith Militant to pass. Tommen is surprised at this and does not want to risk bloodshed escalating matters - particularly, shedding blood on holy ground. As he hesitates, the mob of commoners behind him starts shouting that he is really a bastard and an abomination of incest. Realizing this is not going to end well, Tommen meekly withdraws back to the Red Keep. Margaery is even more upset at how ineffectual young Tommen was, so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother Olenna back to the capital to deal with this.  In Dorne Jaime Lannister and Ser Bronn are on a Pentoshi merchant ship, which is headed to Oldtown in the Reach. They sail past Tarth, off the coast of the Stormlands, which Jaime mistakenly identifies as Estermont. The captain corrects him, stating that they are sailing through the Sapphire Isle, which reminds him of Brienne. Jaime explains to Bronn that he bribed the captain to let them take a small boat to shore as they pass Dorne, and they will land just outside of Sunspear and the adjacent Water Gardens. Below decks, Bronn remarks on why Jaime must want to go and protect Princess Myrcella for himself: he's the one who let Tyrion escape, and he hopes this will make up for that. Jaime curtly says that Varys did (when in fact, Jaime forced Varys to help him free Tyrion). Bronn says that if Jaime ever sees Tyrion again Jaime should give him his regards; Jaime angrily says that if he sees his brother again, he's going to split him in two for murdering their father Tywin.  Jaime sword fight dorne s5 Jaime uses his metal hand to stop a blade.  Bronn rows the pair ashore at dusk, though Jaime can't help row with his one hand. When they awake the next morning Bronn kills a snake that was near Jaime's head and roasts it up for breakfast. Bronn is worried that the ship's captain will subsequently spread word that a Lannister is in Dorne; Jaime says he bribed him with a large bag of gold, but Bronn still worries. A mounted patrol soon comes by, however, and sees their tracks in the sand. Jaime and Bronn present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the night, but the ruse doesn't work, and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed. Bronn plants his sword in the sand - then quickly throws his dagger in the lead sentry's throat. Jaime and Bronn draw their swords and fight the rest. Jaime can't fight very well left-handed so Bronn kills one sentry's horse in order for Jaime to fight him on foot. Jaime is being overpowered but catches the sentry's sword with his metal hand at the last moment. He then uses the distraction to land a killing blow to the sentry with his left hand. Bronn, having finished off the other sentries, notes that they now have their horses: fine Dornish sand steeds, capable of running a day and a night without tiring. Jaime says the bodies need to be buried so they won't raise more questions. Bronn says it will take a lot of time to dig holes for them all, though Jaime again points out that he can't really do much digging with one hand. Annoyed, Bronn then drags off the bodies to bury.  Sand Snakes torture with scorpions The Sand Snakes torture a merchant ship captain.  Meanwhile, elsewhere outside of Sunspear, Ellaria Sand meets with three of the eight Sand Snakes, her lover Oberyn Martell's bastard daughters. Obara Sand, the eldest, is the daughter of a peasant; Nymeria Sand (commonly called \"Nym\") is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman; the youngest of the three, Tyene Sand, is Ellaria's own daughter. She informs them that Prince Doran Martell will not raise Dorne's armies to avenge his brother's death. They worry that they have no army to march against the Lannisters, but Ellaria tells them that they don't need one: to start a war, all they need to do is kill Cersei's daughter Myrcella, currently in Doran's possession.  Obara then points out that they may have a problem. The Pentoshi ship captain found her in Planky Town, and as Bronn feared, he indeed tried to sell her information about Jaime Lannister's arrival in Dorne. The Sand Snakes, however, were insulted that he wanted to be paid for such vital information instead of offering it freely, so they took him prisoner and tortured it out of him. Nymeria uses her whip to knock a bucket over. The turned-over bucket reveals that they buried the ship's captain neck-deep in the sand and his head had been under bucket full of venomous scorpions. They realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take Myrcella from Doran first: Jaime Lannister or themselves. Ellaria asks if the three girls are with her, knowing this will bring Dorne into war. Nymeria and Tyene say yes. Obara notes that when she first met Oberyn, he was a man whom she had never met who one day appeared, said he was her father, and that he was taking her away from her mother. Her mother wept, but Oberyn said, \"We all must choose our battles and the gods let us choose our weapons.\" He threw his spear at her feet, pointed to her mother's tears, then to his spear, and told her to choose. She chose the spear - and answers Ellaria that she is with her, as she chose the path of the spear and war long ago. She then throws her spear to impale the ship captain's head.  On the Summer Sea Jorah kidnaps Tyrion sons of the harpy Tyrion is held captive by Jorah.  At Volantis, during the night, Jorah Mormont knocks out a fisherman and steals his boat, leaving with his captive Tyrion Lannister. Later when they are at sea, Tyrion urges for Jorah to remove his gag. Jorah will not volunteer any information about himself, but from a few observations (such as the bear sigil on his armor), Tyrion quickly surmises that he must be Jorah Mormont. He admits to Tyrion that the \"Queen\" he is taking him to is not Cersei but Daenerys. Tyrion recalls from Small Council meetings that Jorah was spying on Daenerys for Varys. Given that he is half the world away from Daenerys, he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled - and therefore, he kidnapped Tyrion in the hope that presenting him as a gift to Daenerys will get him back in her favor. Tyrion laughs aloud at his situation, informing Jorah that he was already heading to meet Daenerys, so this is a waste of a kidnapping. Tyrion also points out that there is no guarantee this will assuage Daenerys, and it is just as likely she will remain angry at Jorah, and welcome himself as an ally. Jorah smacks Tyrion across the face, quieting him down.  At the Wall Melisandre and jon sons of the harpy Melisandre seduces Jon.  Jon Snow trains recruits in the practice yard of Castle Black, as Stannis Baratheon and his wife Selyse watch, along with their daughter Shireen. Selyse is worried that Stannis wishes Jon was his son, because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness, but he says that wasn't her fault. Melisandre joins them and appears to quite firmly take Stannis's side, declaring that the Lord of Light doesn't care about Shireen's Greyscale disfigurement, and this doesn't change the fact that she has her father's blood. When Selyse departs, Melisandre discusses the coming battle to take Winterfell from the Boltons. She asks if Stannis intends to leave her behind as he did at the Blackwater, but Stannis assures her he won't this time.  As the new Lord Commander, Jon goes over paperwork with Samwell Tarly, letters they have received from minor Houses offering up a handful of new recruits. Jon balks when Samwell hands him a request letter for Roose Bolton, saying he killed his brother Robb. Sam points out that Roose Bolton is now the Warden of the North, and he has the most recruits to send them - much more than the pittances offered by the other minor Houses Jon has never even heard of. He reminds Jon that the Night's Watch has sworn an oath of political neutrality. With disgust, Jon reluctantly signs the letter to the Boltons.  As Sam departs, Melisandre enters. She entreats him to assist Stannis in retaking Winterfell, pointing out that even if he doesn't become a Stark, his familiarity with the castle could win them the battle. She also acknowledges that there is a greater war at stake, and asks Jon if he is on the side of life or death, undoing her dress and straddling him as she does so. She encourages Snow to take her, as the Lord of Light made humans male and female for a reason; although clearly tempted, Jon refuses, citing his vows, and the fact that Stannis wouldn't approve (to which Melisandre suggests they not tell him). When Melisandre points out that he broke his vows once before, Jon acknowledges that he still loves his now-deceased lover Ygritte. Melisandre adjusts her dress and leaves, but not before uttering the words Ygritte had always told Jon: \"You know nothing, Jon Snow.\"  Later, Stannis is in his chambers at Castle Black working on other letters, and Shireen enters. Stannis begins to apologize for dragging her along on campaign with him, as Castle Black is hardly a place for a child, but Shireen cuts him off. She tells him she is happy to have come and expected to be left at Dragonstone, as Selyse had wanted. Shireen asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity. Stannis gets up from his table and explains that not long after Shireen was born, a Dornish trader arrived on Dragonstone and, having heard of Shireen's birth, gave a wooden doll as a gift for the newborn girl. Unfortunately, the doll was contaminated with greyscale, and by the time that was discovered, Shireen had already contracted the disease. Everyone claimed Shireen would die of it sooner or later, and urged Stannis to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her days with the \"Stone Men\" before the disease infected the rest of the castle. Stannis says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer, apothecary, and Maester he could to save Shireen. Stannis insists that Shireen is his daughter and he would not send her away because she belonged with her family. Shireen, overjoyed at her father's declaration, runs over and gives him a hug which, after an awkward pause, Stannis returns.  At Winterfell Sansa winterfell Sons of the harpy Sansa visits the tombs of her family.  At Winterfell, Sansa Stark takes the opportunity to visit her family's underground crypts. She comes to the tomb and statue of her aunt Lyanna Stark (and finds the feather token that Robert Baratheon left there years ago when he visited the castle). Petyr Baelish arrives and says he thought he'd find her there. Sansa remarks that her father, Eddard Stark, never talked about Lyanna, but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb. Sansa never knew Lyanna because she died before she was born, but she notes that people say she was beautiful.  Littlefinger says that he actually saw Lyanna once years ago, and she was as beautiful as everyone says. Back when he was a boy living with Sansa's mother's family, the old Lord Whent of Harrenhal held a massive tournament: every notable figure of the time came from across Westeros: the Mad King, Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, Robert Baratheon, Lyanna Stark, everyone. Lyanna had already been publicly betrothed to Robert at the time. Baelish remembers how awed he was, a boy from nowhere and with no significant holdings, to see all of these living legends gathered in one place. In the final tilt, Prince Rhaegar rode against Ser Barristan Selmy. Rhaegar won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers - only to suddenly drop dead silent when Rhaegar rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, to lay the victor's crown (made of blue winter roses) in Lyanna's lap. Not long afterward, Rhaegar made off with Lyanna, sparking off Robert's Rebellion which overthrew the Targaryen dynasty. Littlefinger wonders how many thousands died because Rhaegar chose Lyanna - to which Sansa says that he chose her, then kidnapped and raped her. Baelish gives her a wry look and moves on to another part of the crypts.  Sansa notices that Littlefinger is wearing riding clothes, and he explains that he is heading back to King's Landing, because Cersei sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to come. Sansa will be alone with the Boltons but he explains his plan to her: Stannis will have to attack the Boltons soon if he is to beat the winter snows, and he bets that Stannis will probably win, because he is one of the best military commanders in all of Westeros, and the Boltons will be outnumbered by Stannis, as the other northern houses would be quick to betray their liege lord. Stannis will then make Sansa the new ruler of the North, as the last (known) surviving Stark heir and in memory of her father Eddard's support for Stannis. Sansa asks what will happen on the off chance that Stannis gets killed, and Littlefinger explains that marrying Ramsay Bolton now will at least leave Sansa in a position to insinuate herself among the Boltons and help destroy them from within in future plans. Either way, Sansa will be Littlefinger's powerful \"ally\" in the North. Littlefinger kisses Sansa on the lips, and departs.  In Meereen The Sons of the Harpy 06 Dany speaks with Ser Barristan.  In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the Great Pyramid, and Ser Barristan Selmy also brings up Rhaegar Targaryen. He says that the city's inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance, but Rhaegar actually liked to leave the Red Keep and mingle with the common people on the streets. Barristan accompanied him often to guard him, and says that Rhaegar liked to sing to people. He was a great singer, so he would find a place on one of the streets just like any public minstrel and sing. He liked to see how much money he could make, and everyone enjoyed his singing, so he often made quite a lot. Daenerys is surprised, because her brother Viserys only told her that Rhaegar was a great killer.  Grey worm sons of harpy fighting An injured Grey Worm continues to fight the Sons of the Harpy.  Barristan scoffs that Rhaegar was a great warrior but never enjoyed killing, he was a gentle man who enjoyed singing. She asks what they did with all the money, and Barristan says that they did all sorts of things: sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road, once Rhaegar gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of Flea Bottom, and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk. Daario Naharis then comes to say that the day's supplicants are waiting in the throne room, chief among them Hizdahr zo Loraq. Aware of his dislike of politics, Daenerys asks if Barristan wants to attend her in the throne room; after being assured that Daario has her back, she gives him the day off, cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below.  Hizdahr again beseeches Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits of Meereen, because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season. Daenerys again refuses, but Hizdahr rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a great spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the slave-masters and slaves, and is one of the few things that can bring the city together. Bringing back this major tradition will not instantly solve all of her problems, he concedes, but it would be a start at mending together her subjects.  Barristan selmy sons of the harpy Barristan runs towards danger.  As he speaks, the Sons of the Harpy are already mounting a series of large-scale attacks in the streets. A Meereenese prostitute helps them distract and kill some of the Second Sons, and when a patrol of Unsullied arrives, she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the Sons of the Harpy ran into a narrow alleyway. The Unsullied give chase, only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the Sons of the Harpy. Brutal fighting rages throughout the streets of Meereen. Grey Worm is among the ambushed Unsullied; he kills many of the attackers, but loses his helmet, is slashed in the leg, and is stabbed in his side. Grey Worm pulls the dagger out of his own chest, stabs a foe in the throat with it, and keeps fighting, though his wounds slow him considerably. Most of the Sons of the Harpy are dead but they outnumber the Unsullied so much to begin with that only Grey Worm is left. Just then, Ser Barristan arrives and saves Grey Worm from certain death by drawing the attention of the remaining rebels. He takes on eight Sons of the Harpy, killing seven of them; the eighth stabs him in the belly. He falls to his knees, but before the attacker can cut his throat, Grey Worm thrusts his spear into his back, killing him. Grey Worm staggers over to the unconscious Barristan before collapsing from his wounds.

You're Aemon Targaryen. - What happened to your face? - Greyscale. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria, to live out your short life with the Stonemen. Two of my sisters had it. They were covered with it. The acted like animals. Hide! Hide! Put him in chains. You want me alive so you can torture me. Sansa Stark? I saw her riding on the East Road with Littlefinger. We'll follow them. - May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton. - My Lady. Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers. You let a halfwit escape through the crypt. And Rickon too, the little one. I told you what would happen if you serve me loyally. And what would happen if you did not. - Who are you? - Your captor. You said you're taking me to the queen. I meant Daenerys Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons. Show your strength. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know, he's flown half way across the world. The Wise Masters ask for the reopening of the fighting pits. Where slaves fought slaves to the death? Opening them would show the people of Meereen that you respect their traditions. Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city together. I'm so sorry, my queen. He was a good man. \"Barristan the Bold\" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks. We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide. I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me. But I'm the leader of my family. No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps. \"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure.\" She sounds like quite a woman. And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying. Don't say that, Maester Aemon. A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing. Maester Aemon. Lord Commander. Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone. How are you feeling? Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death. I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order. Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it. But you don't know what it is. That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born. Where are the rest of the free folk now? Where have they gone? Who leads them? They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else. What about you? Hard to lead when you're in chains. What if I unchained you? Why would you do that? Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours. You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends. For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you. And now everything is going to change? - It is. - Why now? Because now I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. What would you have me do, Lord Commander? I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall. They won't kneel for you and neither will I. I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes. The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them. And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick-- what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward. Easy thing to say to a man in chains. Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people. Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is? Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week. We'll need ships. I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet. All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding wot be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me or I don't go. You'd bring wildlings here through our gates? Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing. Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us. Fewer. - What? - Nothing. Look, well, there is good farmland in the Gift. Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages. And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people. Aye! We've been fighting them for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers. And we've slaughtered theirs. I will follow you anywhere, you know that. - But they killed Grenn. - Yes. - And they killed Pyp. - Aye. They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it. You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that. Thank you. Olly. If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right. You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them. It's not a trick. They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew. I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone. Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander? No. She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here. Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it. Thank you. You've lived here a long time? Aye. Did you know Lord Eddard? I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now. Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle. Everyone knows. The Boltons. I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark. Who are you? Someone who swore to keep her safe. Swore to who? Her mother. Her mother's dead. That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve? Come back here. Myranda. I saw you staring at her. I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time. You said you'd marry me. And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty. Do you think she's pretty? Of course I do. I'm not blind. You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you. Perhaps I'll marry, too. You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda? Never. Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin. Oh, I don't need-- You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower. - But who-- - You're not alone. I like your dress. Who made it for you? I made it myself. Really? Who-- who are you? I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? Oh, wonderful. The stitching. - Who taught you? - My mother. I'm sorry for what happened to her. Thank you. It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her. I'd rather have a mother. I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember. Down there at the end. What is it? That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it. Theon? You shouldn't be here. You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine. Do you have something to tell me? No, my lord. Reek. She saw me. Who? Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels. She saw you? Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think-- Come here. You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees. Give me your hand. I forgive you. I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady. Yes, thank you, my lord. Allow me. Mother. Thank you, Ramsay. My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth. To your wedding. To your wedding. It must be difficult for you being in a strange place. This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange. You're right. Very strange. More wine, please. I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek? Yes, master. That's his new name-- Reek. Why are you doing this? Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murding her two brothers. I'm sorry. Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye. - I'm sorry. - Sorry about what? For killing your brothers. There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good? Yes, yes, very good. Wonderful. Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together. We're going to have a baby. I'm very happy for you. From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy. How can you be sure? Sure of what? That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell? Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt. So how did you manage it? Manage what? Getting her pregnant. I imagine you're familiar with the procedure. Of course, but how did you find it? You disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the Stark girl. And if it's a boy? You're worried about your position. My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along. You've never asked me about your mother. Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are. She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him? Yes. Is this every book there is? Every book there is? - In the world. - Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually. Where you grew up, were there more books? My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world. Where's that? The Citadel? In Oldtown. I'm sorry I don't know things. Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound. I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor. - Well - Why does the Citadel have the biggest library? It's where they train the maesters. Like Maester Aemon? I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you. Ah, Your Grace. You're Samwell Tarly? I am, Your Grace. Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker. I did, Your Grace. How? With a dagger made of dragonglass. Dragonglass? What the maesters call obsidian. I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker? I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass. The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall. I've seen it, Your Grace. Seen what? The army of the dead. - And when they come-- - We have to know how to fight them. Keep reading, Samwell Tarly. It's time. Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men. If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage-- more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise. I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess. No need. They're coming with us. It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. - Won't they be safer-- - Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us. As you wish, Your Grace. Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt? Beg your pardon? At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-- First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle. Is there going to be a battle? Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near-- That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child. Yes, my queen. - I'm not scared. - Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me. I promise. I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships. You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you. Mount up! Colors! No. You're still too weak. _ _ Ser Barristan? _ _ _ _ _ _ Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known. This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid. All men fear death. No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath. Now you have given the Masters what they deserve. If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think? Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters. You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think? I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors because there was a better choice. One that only you could see. My-- my queen, please do not do this. What about \"valar morghulis\"? I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live. Yes, my queen. And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen. We are. What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine. No wine. I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria. I am. Have you sailed this route before? No. You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough? I think you'll be plenty. You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom? No. But pirates are. Oh. The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then And then they weren't. And then they weren't. \"They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned--\" \"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.\" I would clap. I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains. What was that? Stone Men! Don't let them touch you! Get behind! Mormont, cut me free! Mormont! Mormont! Mormont! Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right. You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you? You? I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that. I suppose that's why they send them there. It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. So what now? We walk up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat. Without luck? We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh? That's the best idea you've had all day.", "summary": ["Plot Dany makes a difficult decision in Meereen. Jon recruits the help of an unexpected ally. Brienne searches for Sansa. Theon remains under Ramsay's control.  Summary In Meereen Missandei  Dany-Kill the Boy Daenerys watches on as her dragons set a head of great family on fire and proceed to eat him.  watches over the wounded Grey Worm, who is still unconscious from his wounds sustained fighting the Sons of the Harpy. Daenerys and Daario Naharis watch over the deceased Ser Barristan Selmy. Hizdahr zo Loraq enters to extend his condolences. Daario suggests pulling back around the pyramid to use it as a base from which to eradicate the Sons of the Harpy. Daenerys instead opts for rounding up the leaders of each great family in Meereen, including Hizdahr. The leaders are brought to the catacombs where Rhaegal and Viserion are chained up. Daenerys's Unsullied push the leaders slowly towards the two dragons, who can be heard growling from the darkness. Daenerys states that good mothers do not give up on their children, they discipline them if needed, but never give up on them. She nods to Daario to push one of the leaders further forward. A stream of fire coming from Rhaegal sets the man aflame before he is torn apart and eaten by both dragons. Daenerys suggests that the dragons may determine the innocence of the captives and touches Hizdahr's back as if she wanted to push him but then she pretends she wants not to overfeed the dragons and lets the rest of the men be led away. Grey Worm wakes up later with Missandei sitting beside him. He asks if Barristan Selmy survived the attack by the Sons of the Harpy but Missandei shakes her head. Grey Worm thinks he has failed Ser Barristan, his men and Daenerys -- a claim Missandei denies. Missandei tells him he shouldn't be ashamed for being wounded given that he was ambushed and outnumbered, but Grey Worm says he is ashamed that he was afraid when he was stabbed. Missandei says that everyone fears death. However, Grey Worm says it isn't death he fears, it is the thought of never getting to see Missandei again that terrified him. Missandei is noticeably touched and kisses Grey Worm.  Daenerys asks Missandei whether she should reopen the fighting pits. Missandei only says that she has seen Daenerys listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong. Daenerys visits the imprisoned Hizdahr, who begs for his life. Daenerys tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits, but only for free men. She also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of Meereen to forge a bond with the people of the city, and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already. She leaves a very confused Hizdahr to ponder that he will live, and that he will soon be Meereen's prince consort.  At the Wall Aemon Samwell Kill the Boy Maester Aemon  Sam reads a note from Slaver's Bay to Maester Aemon updating him on Daenerys's situation. Sam praises Daenerys's courage but Maester Aemon worries about his great-niece's safety because she is all alone, under siege, and with hardly anyone to guide her, while her \"last relation\" is useless and dying thousands of miles away. Jon Snow enters to speak with Aemon in private. He needs the maester's advice on a controversial order that half of the Night's Watch will hate him for. Aemon tells Jon that half the men at Castle Black already hate him, but that he should trust in his command. He says that Jon will not enjoy being Lord Commander, but with luck, he may find the strength to do what needs to be done. Jon is told to \"kill the boy, and let the man be born.\" Jon then meets with Tormund Giantsbane and offers to forge an alliance with the wildlings, bidding Tormund to go north of the wall and rally them all. He will open the gates for them and give them land south of the wall in which to settle. In return, the wildlings will fight alongside the Night\u2019s Watch when White Walkers arrive. Tormund is initially reluctant and to convince him, Jon unlocks his chains, freeing him. Tormund relents, and reveals that most of the wildlings are up at Hardhome. Jon offers him horses and men to bring the wildlings back. Tormund tells him that they\u2019ll need ships to bring his people back, which Jon says he\u2019ll borrow from Stannis. Tormund's final condition is that Jon accompany him as a guarantee that the wildlings will not fall prey to any traps set by the Night's Watch.  The men of the Night\u2019s Watch do not take news of the alliance well, citing the countless innocent lives lost due to the wildlings. Even Jon\u2019s friend Edd rejects this decision, stating that the wildlings killed their friends Grenn and Pyp. Nevertheless, Jon decides to go ahead with his plan, insisting that if they abandon the wildlings at Hardhome, the White Walkers will exterminate them all and then raise their corpses as more wights to swell their ranks . In the library, Sam tells Gilly about his wish to go to Citadel and become a maester before he was sent to the Night\u2019s Watch, when Stannis Baratheon walks in. Stannis reminisces about how Sam\u2019s father, Randyll Tarly, defeated Robert Baratheon in the Battle of Ashford. Stannis wants to know how Sam killed the White Walker and Sam tells him how he did it with a dagger made of dragonglass. Stannis muses that it is abundantly available in Dragonstone. Sam has been researching dragonglass and how it can kill White Walkers, but has yet to come up with anything. Stannis tells him to continue his research and leaves.  Later, Stannis tells Ser Davos that they will march toward Winterfell the next morning. Davos suggests waiting until Jon returns with the wildlings, but Stannis decides against it, as any delay improves the Boltons' chances. He also wants to take Selyse and Shireen with them, as he does not think they will be safe at the Wall, surrounded by criminals. The next morning, Stannis\u2019s army, with Stannis and Melisandre at its head, starts its journey to Winterfell.  In the North Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne, still pursuing Sansa Stark, arrive at an inn near Winterfell. Podrick suggests that Sansa may be better off at Winterfell now that she is far away from the Lannisters, but Brienne believes that Sansa will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the Boltons. Their conversation is interrupted by a servant. Correctly suspecting that he is still loyal to the Starks, Brienne tells of her allegiance to Catelyn Stark and convinces the servant to get a message through to Sansa \u2013 her presence still being something of a secret, the old servant seems to gain strength from the idea of a surviving Stark.  In Winterfell, Ramsay Bolton and his bedwarmer Myranda discuss Ramsay\u2019s upcoming marriage to Sansa. Myranda admits her jealousy of Sansa, especially since he had promised to marry Myranda back when he was a bastard. Ramsay disregards Myranda\u2019s insecurities, causing Myranda to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too. Ramsay is angered and violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere. Further, she is starting to bore him with her jealously, and she knows what he does to people who bore him. Hearing this Myranda swears never to bore him again.  Meanwhile, Sansa\u2019s maid carries the message from Brienne to her. Consoling Sansa that she still has allies in the North, she tells Sansa to light a candle in the highest window of the Broken Tower if she ever needs help. As Sansa wanders around the castle, coming to the tower where Jaime Lannister pushed her brother Brandon out of the window, she runs into Myranda. Myranda puts on a friendly fa\u00e7ade, talking to Sansa about her mother\u2019s demise. To help Sansa \u201cremember\u201d how things used to be, Myranda leads Sansa down to the kennels, where she finds Reek, formerly Theon Greyjoy, asleep in one of the cages. Awoken by Sansa\u2019s arrival, he just shakes his head, when Sansa calls him \"Theon.\" He warns her that she shouldn't be down there. Seeing Reek in such a pitiful condition, Sansa angrily storms away.  Sansa Ramsay Kill the Boy Sansa at the \"family\" dinner.  As Reek helps Ramsay get ready for dinner, he confesses to Ramsay that earlier that day, Sansa saw him in his cage. Ramsay, for his own amusement, makes it seem as though he\u2019s going to punish Reek severely, before simply forgiving him. At dinner, Ramsay is initially well-behaved, toasting his wedding to Sansa, but is soon back to his old ways as he forces Reek to apologize to Sansa for murdering Bran and Rickon. With much difficulty, Reek finally mutters an apology. Ramsay then suggests that Reek be the one to give Sansa away at the wedding, since he is the closest thing Sansa has to kin and Roose Bolton distractedly accepts the suggestion. Seeing that Ramsay is getting complacent, however, Roose has Walda announce that she is pregnant with a boy. Ramsay is clearly distressed by the news, which in turn delights Sansa. Roose and Ramsay Roose tells Ramsay about his conception.  After dinner, Ramsay expresses his distress at the possibility of the unborn child jeopardizing his claim on the North. Roose reprimands his son for disgracing himself at dinner but seemingly dismisses his concern. He then shares the story of Ramsay\u2019s birth; Roose raped a miller\u2019s wife, who had married without his consent, after hanging her husband. A year later, she showed up with Ramsay, claiming that the baby was his. Roose nearly had her whipped and the baby drowned, but when Roose laid eyes upon Ramsay, he was convinced that he was his son and decided to keep him. He then reveals to Ramsay that Stannis has an army at Castle Black. Stannis plans to take the Iron Throne and the road to King\u2019s Landing passes through Winterfell, which means that Stannis also intends to take the North. He wants Ramsay\u2019s help in defeating Stannis, and Ramsay agrees.  Old Valyria Stonemen attack Tyrion and Jorah are attacked by the Stonemen  As Jorah and Tyrion continue their journey to Meereen, and following Jorah's violent reaction to a previous conversation, Tyrion tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are. As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon, Tyrion deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of Old Valyria, a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria's reputation. Tyrion is apprehensive, but still excited to see the ruins of what was once the greatest civilization in the world.  As they catch glimpses of domes, towers and aqueducts, Tyrion recites a poem about the Doom of Valyria, with Jorah joining in at the end. Suddenly, through the fog, they see Drogon fly into view. Although he had been hearing about the dragons for some time, Tyrion is still utterly gobsmacked to see one in person. Jorah is struck silent too, as Drogon is even bigger and more majestic than when he left. So distracted are they that they don't notice when the statues on a nearby aqueduct stand up and leap at the boat: they are Stone Men - victims of greyscale so far gone that they have been sent to live out the rest of their lives in quarantine in the ruins. Jorah tells Tyrion not to let them touch him and fights them off.  However, as Tyrion is tied up, he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while Jorah battles more at the other end.  Just before the stone man is able to grab him, Tyrion rolls off of the boat and into the water to escape, where he is then pulled down by more stone men under the water.  An undetermined amount of time later, Tyrion wakes up and finds himself on a shore, dragged out of the water by Jorah. After confirming to each other that they had not been touched by the stone men, Jorah tells Tyrion that he hopes to find a fishing village and get a boat soon, otherwise they'll have to walk all the way around Slaver's Bay to eventually reach Meereen. Tyrion seems up for it and Jorah goes to look for firewood so they can make camp. However, once out of Tyrion's view, he pulls back his sleeve to inspect the cracked skin on his wrist, confirming that he had been infected with greyscale during the fight with the stone men. He looks at Tyrion and then glances in the direction of Meereen, knowing that even if he dies, he needs to get Tyrion to Daenerys."], "review": null}, "46": {"id": "s05e06", "name": "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken", "script": "My son Jorah, fled Westeros. He brought dishonor to our House. I need to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of The Night's Watch. And how's that going, commander Mormont? I shall have your head for this! You're taking us through Valyria. The Doom still rules Valyria. - Stone Men! Don't let them touch you! You? The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. Cersei sent for me. I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return. I hope I can make her happy. She's suffered enough. I'll never hurt her. All sinners are equal before the gods. What would you say if I told you of a great sinner in our very midst? May the Father judge him justly. Who do you think you are? Justice. Your brother was murdered while you sit here and doing nothing. The Sand Snakes are with me. Without Doran, we have no army to march against the Lannisters. Queen Cersei loves her children. And we have one of them. We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back to her family. You ever been to Dorne? The Dornish are crazy. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. Here we serve the Many-Faced God. To serve well, a girl must become no one. What do we do with them after we wash them?    What are they doing with the bodies? Get back to work. No. I've been here for weeks. I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it. You will know why. - When? - When it's time, not before. Get back to work. When do I get to play the game? Game? The game. The Game of Faces. You tried already. You failed. I didn't even know I was playing. Who are you? No one. Get back to work. Who are you? What are you doing here? How did you get here? I'm from Westeros just like you. Daughter of a lord just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter, so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out. Sought help from the Faceless Men. And my father was widowed again. I've been serving them ever since. Was that true or a lie? What? Did you believe every word I said? Get back to work. Who are you? Who are you? Arya. And where did you come from? Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord, Eddard Stark. He died in battle. A lie. After he was executed, I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back. A lie. I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother, but I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me, a man called Polliver. A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me, but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer. I hated him. I hated him. That's not a lie! A girl lies to me, to the Many-Faced God, to herself. Does she truly want to be no one? Yes. I'm not playing this stupid game anymore! We never stop playing. So, those villages we were supposed to find? We can't live on berries and roots. I can. You're not hungry? Of course I'm hungry. You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I've ever met. I'm not your travelling companion. We are travelling together in each other's company, therefore-- Do you ever shut up? I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate without ever saying a word. Why? It never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis? I'm sure you visited many brothels in many cities. I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved. As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man. What do you know about my father? I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men, he knew all their stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people under his command. How do they put it in the Watch? \"We shall never see his like again.\" Oh, you didn't know. I'm sorry. I am. How? I only know what I heard. How? He was leading an expedition beyond the Wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men. We better keep moving. Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris. I have nowhere else to go. I've taken her to every healer in Braavos. I've spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end. It hurts. I know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me more than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the Many-Faced God. And I drank the water from his fountain. It healed me. I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore? Drink. Is a girl ready? To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue? Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates? All that makes a girl who she is? Forever? No. A girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else. Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion. Do you believe in anything? I believe in lots of things. In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The gods, destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world? No. Neither did I. I was a cynic just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing? No. It's hard to be a cynic after that. Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen. No, it doesn't. The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? and prosperity? First we have to conquer the world. We? All right, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the Iron Throne. Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what? Then she rules. So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice? - She's the rightful heir. - Why? Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king? - That's a slave ship. - Why are they anchored? They probably came ashore for-- Got a lot of fight in you, huh? Salt mines? Yeah, that or a galley slave. He looks strong enough. What about the dwarf? Worthless. Cut his throat. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this. And then chop off his cock. We'll sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers. Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf? It will be a dwarf-sized cock. Guess again. The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant. Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery. We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I've never heard of free men fighting in the pits. in Meereen? You're in luck, then. You're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms. Him. Him? He's got to be 60 years old. Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him. That true? He won the tournament at Lannisport. Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself. - The Kingslayer. Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight in the pits of Meereen will swallow him whole. I killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat. Liar. It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth. For my children. Money. Lord Baelish. Yes? Lancel Lannister. Brother Lancel. We abandon our family names. Quite a family to abandon. The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and set the godless on the run. Well done. I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed? Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing. We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining. Do you think it's wise, Your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden? The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden. Of course, and the Faith were armed on your orders. The king's orders. Is the king to blame for Ser Loras's perversion? House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult. House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me. Instead he chose the company of boys. One's choice of companion is a curious thing. Most curious. Lysa Arryn, for instance. Thoroughly repellant woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning. Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman. She was neither of those things. We both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him. I know how hard it can be to lose both your parents at such a young age. If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights of the Vale  fight for their king? Young Lord Robin heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne. Good. If there's nothing else. There is another matter, Your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame, I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive and well and home again living at Winterfell. That's not possible. My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen. Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father. Indeed, his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart. We were fools to trust a turncloak. Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house. I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on their bloody Sigil. I would counsel patience, Your Grace. Patience? Sansa helped murder my son. Roose Bolton is a traitor. Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle. Let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other. And when they're done, seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives. Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from her The weather has already begun to turn. That is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force. My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse. Ser Jaime, then. Jaime's away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I have no idea when he'll be back. Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow. Forgive me, Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a moneylender and a brothel keeper, not a military man. You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the royal treasury. What do you have to lose? A brothel keeper? And if you succeed? Name me Warden of the North. I'll speak to the king this evening, have him issue a royal decree. I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell. And I'll know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike. As I said I live to serve. I'm going to ask him tomorrow. - What if he says no? - He won't. We've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife. Now. What is it? Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it? Or do you-- We can't. Not yet. Why not? You know why not. Someone will see. You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We're allowed to walk through the gardens together. How many other girls have you walked through these gardens? I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous. They do not go squinty and you didn't answer the question. a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them. Yes, my prince. You haven't had to use that axe of yours in a long time. I hope you remember how. I remember how. was as fair as the sun   And her kisses were warmer than spring   The Dornishman's blade   It was made of black steel   And its kiss was a terrible thing   The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed  -  In a voice that was sweet as a peach--  - All right, that's enough. I'm coming to the best part. We're trying to blend in. Don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent. This song really is all about the ending. It can wait. There. That's the Water Gardens. the princess, then what? I like to improvise. That explains the golden hand. Unbroken. For Oberyn. For Oberyn. Well, she's made herself at home. Myrcella. Uncle Jaime? I-- I don't understand. What are you doing here? Let's speak in private. - I am Trystane Martell. - Trystane is my intended. Excellent. Good to meet you. We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime. Why don't you let them have some time alone, son? Let's not do something stupid. - That was something stupid. We have to go, Myrcella, now. - You hurt him! - He'll be fine, I promise. But we have to-- Oh, for fuck's sake. Take her! - You're coming with me. - I don't want to. I wasn't asking, princess. - Ah! - Drop your weapons! I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for? Drop your weapons. When you were whole, it would have been a good fight. You fight pretty good for a little girl. Halt! Oh, you can smell the shit from five miles away. Well, why have we stopped? Go on. Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing, there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else. Everyone knew about him and Renly. Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew, no one cared. But he was the king's brother. And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable. - Cersei's behind it. - Yeah, of course she is. She wants to drag our name through the dirt, put us in our place. Get some rest, dear. You look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister. Your Grace, I have travelled a long way. You must be exhausted. Put the pen down, dear. We both know you're not writing anything. Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued Queen of Thorns. And the famous tart Queen Cersei. I beg your pardon? I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson. If you apologize for that comment, perhaps I'll-- You'll get your apology when I get Loras. I was as shocked as anyone when the Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics, but what can a Queen Mother do? Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies? I can assure you, our alliance with House Tyrell remains-- Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison? As I said, I didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats-- What veil? The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare? I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them. House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna. You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly? I don't pay attention to rumors. You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside even as Stannis's army closed in. He was my friend. He was my king. Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly. I was wrong to support Renly's claim, I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater. Yes, wearing Renly's armor. Why does it matter what I wore? Do you deny all the charges against you? Fornication. Buggery. Blasphemy. Of course I deny them. You never lay with Renly Baratheon? Never. Nor any other man? Never. That will be all, Ser Loras. Well, I think that's quite enough of that. The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward. You call me forward? Yes, we have some questions for you. - I am the queen. - You are. And according to the law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest. How do you respond to these charges against your brother? They are lies. - All of them? - All of them. Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge? Yes, I swear it. Thank you, Your Grace. Do you know this man? Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden. How did you come to meet? I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met. And what occurred in his chamber? We engaged in intimate relations. You lay with him? That night and many others. Liar. He's a liar. Is there anyone else who can support your claim? Yes. Yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised. This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should the Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden? Your Grace. Quite high on his thigh. Wine-colored and roughly the shape of Dorne. No! Liar! What are you doing? Let us pass. The Faith is satisfied there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery. What? Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any, my lady. Take her. No. Tommen. Tommen! You can't do this. I am the queen. Tommen! Tommen! I am your queen. How dare you? Take your hands off me! Tommen! What do you want? Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you a bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband, don't you? You're so beautiful, but you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You don't want to end up like-- well, like the others. What others? I shouldn't gossip. Oh, it's good to see the red again. No point hiding anymore. What others? Let's see, there was Kyra the blacksmith's daughter. She was tall like you, lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and Ramsay grew tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blonde hair. But she got pregnant. And, well, that was boring. Then Tansy. Such a sweet girl. Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt. Hunt? Mmm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But, well, it's your wedding day. Why am I talking about such things? What was your name again? Myranda. And how long have you loved him, Myranda? Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? And I came along and ruined it. I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me. Are you done with your bath, my lady? Go. I can finish on my own. - Yes? I've come to escort you to the godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm? No. Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm. I'm not touching you. Please. He'll punish me. You think I care what he does to you? Who comes before the old gods this night? Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her? Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her? Theon of House Greyjoy, who was-- who was her father's ward. Lady Sansa, will you take this man? I take this man. Are you pleased, my lady? Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you're still a virgin. - Uh, yes. - Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves? Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind. He was gentle. He never touched me. You're not lying to me? No, my lord. Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a bad way to start a marriage. We're man and wife now. We should be honest with each other. Don't you think? Yes. Good. Take off your clothes. Oh, no, no, no. You stay here, Reek. You watch. Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time. Reek I told you to watch. You've known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.", "summary": ["Plot Arya trains. Jorah and Tyrion run into slavers. Trystane and Myrcella make plans. Jaime and Bronn reach their destination. The Sand Snakes attack.  Summary In Braavos Arya continues her training with the Faceless Men. She cleans a corpse methodically, which is then taken away by two men. Arya is obviously curious about what is on the other side of the door through which the corpse was taken. Arya is about to walk through the door when the Waif obstructs her path and latches the door. Arya wants to know what happens to the bodies she scrubs clean, but the Waif tells her that she will know when the time is right. Frustrated at the lack of answers, Arya demands to play the game of faces. The Waif tells her that Arya has already tried playing the game but failed. She again asks Arya who she is, to which Arya replies that she is no one. The Waif simply tells Arya to get back to work and is about to walk away when Arya asks her who she is. The Waif tells Arya a story about how she was the only daughter of a widowed Lord, who remarried, producing another daughter. Her stepmother, in order to secure her own daughter\u2019s future, tried to poison her. The Waif found out about this and sought out the help of the Faceless Men to exact her revenge. The Waif then asks Arya whether she believed the story, surprising Arya. When Arya doesn\u2019t respond, embarrassed that she bought the Waif\u2019s story, the Waif tells her to get back to work, hinting to Arya that to pass the game of faces, Arya must be able to lie convincingly. Later, when Arya is asleep, Jaqen H'ghar comes to test Arya again. This time, when he asks Arya who she is, Arya tells him how she came to join the Faceless Men, trying to slip in a few lies into the story. However, Jaqen is able to tell when Arya is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does. He strikes her repeatedly when she insists she hated the Hound. Before he leaves, he tells her that she is lying not only to him, but to herself as well.  Arya chamber of faces s5 Arya in the Hall of Faces.  A grieving father brings his sickly daughter to the House of Black and White. He explains to Arya that he has been to every healer in Braavos and spent every penny he had. He tells her that his daughter is suffering and needs to find peace. Arya sits besides the girl and tells her a short false story, about how she was sick too, but her father brought her here and when she drank from the temple's well, she was healed. This persuades the sickly girl to drink the poisoned water from the well. The water gives the peace of death to the sickly girl, and Arya, having successfully proven that she can lie, is brought to the Hall of Faces with Jaqen H'ghar, a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces. All the faces had been taken from the corpses that the acolytes wash in the temple. The Faceless Man then asks Arya if she is ready to give up who she is to become \"no one\". After a moment of silence, he then states that she is not ready to become \"no one\" (she is too attached to her past as a Stark), but that she is ready to become \"someone else\".  In Slaver's Bay Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken 04 Jorah and Tyrion in Slaver's Bay  On the western side of Slaver's Bay, Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont are still making their way to Meereen (on the far opposite eastern side of the region) on foot, after losing their boat passing through the Smoking Sea and the ruins of Old Valyria. Tyrion is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as Jorah had hoped, so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat. The topic of just why Tyrion was even in Volantis comes up, and Tyrion is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier: he explains that he actually fled from Westeros because he killed his own father Tywin. He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit, and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved - Jorah nods, as this seems as likely a motivation for Kinslaying as any. Tyrion then says that despite how miserable Jorah is now, at least he can say that he had a good father. Jorah asks how he could have known his father Jeor Mormont, but Tyrion explains he visited the Wall once and met him: he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men, a rare thing in the world, but now as the eulogy for Night's Watch members goes, \"the world will not see his like again.\" Jorah is shocked to realize he means that his father is dead. Tyrion becomes apologetic and says he thought that Jorah knew already. Jorah asks how he died: Tyrion says he only knows the report he heard, which said that his father led an expedition beyond the Wall, but there was a mutiny, and Jeor was murdered by his own men. Jorah processes this in silent grief, then changes the subject by saying that they have to keep moving.  As they walk, Tyrion asks why Jorah would support Daenerys Targaryen and how she would be better than any other rulers , or why Westeros would even support her, given that her father was the Mad King. Jorah explains that he never used to believe in things like destiny and was very cynical, but after seeing Daenerys emerge from the flames unharmed with baby dragons, he believes in her now, and the Iron Throne is hers by right. Tyrion remains skeptical that this doesn't automatically mean she will be a good queen, given that the Targaryens were famous for going insane, just like Daenerys's own father.  Spotting a slaver ship in the distance, Jorah pulls Tyrion to the ground. However, the pair has already been spotted before they start hiding, and the slavers emerge from the trees behind them and take them captive. The lead slaver, Malko, intends to return them back to their destination in Volantis. Tyrion, however, manages to successfully persuade him that Jorah is one of the most skilled knights in Westeros, and would fetch a better price being sold to the fighting pits in Meereen, which have just reopened. Though not in the circumstances they hoped, Tyrion and Jorah are once again quickly heading towards Meereen and Queen Daenerys.  In Dorne Bronn and Jaime approach the Water Gardens, wearing Martell disguises from the soldiers they killed. Bronn wonders what Jaime will do once they get inside and find Myrcella, to which Jaime replies that he likes to improvise; Bronn sarcastically remarks \"That explains the golden hand.\" Meanwhile, Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes are already inside the Gardens. Ellaria sends them out to abduct Myrcella, telling them to do it \"for Oberyn.\"  Myrcella herself is enjoying another stroll with her betrothed, Trystane Martell, Trystane's father Prince Doran Martell and his bodyguard Areo Hotah watch from above. Doran comments that they look lovely together, but that they don't realize how dangerous their betrothal is, and that he and Areo must protect them. Doran asks if Areo remembers how to uses his longaxe, and Areo assures him that he does.  Myrcella-and-Trystane Myrcella and her intended Trystane Martell  Jaime and Bronn infiltrate the Water Gardens and soon come upon Myrcella kissing Trystane. Jaime tries to convince Myrcella to come with him, but Trystane interferes, suspicious of the bloodstains on Bronn and Jaime's Dornish robes. When Trystane tries to draw his sword, Bronn quickly knocks him down, to Myrcella's horror. Jaime tries to lead her away, but they are suddenly attacked by the Sand Snakes. Bronn fights against Tyene and Nymeria, while Obara attacks Jaime with her spear, driving him away from Myrcella. Obara orders Nym to break away from Bronn and take Myrcella prisoner, but as Nym tries to pull her away, they are cut off by Areo and Prince Doran's guards, who surround them and force them all to drop their weapons. Jaime, Bronn, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes are all taken into custody. In King's Landing Petyr Baelish arrives in King\u2019s Landing and is on his way to meet Cersei when he is confronted by Brother Lancel and some other Sparrows. Lancel warns Baelish that they have purged King's Landing of its corrupt ways, and the new King\u2019s Landing will not tolerate his prostitution business. Baelish dismisses these threats.  Cersei, meeting with Baelish, continues to deny her involvement in Loras Tyrell\u2019s arrest by the Faith Militant. Baelish is not fooled and warns that House Tyrell will not tolerate this insult. Cersei claims that she is the insulted one since Ser Loras, who was promised to her, prefers the company of men. Cersei then explains why she summoned Baelish; she is suspicious where his loyalties truly lie and asks him whether she can rely on the the Vale to fight for the Throne if the time comes. Baelish assures her that young Robin heeds his advice and he will always counsel loyalty to the Throne. Baelish then reveals that Sansa is back in Winterfell, where Roose Bolton has arranged for her to marry Ramsay. Cersei is infuriated by the Boltons\u2019 betrayal. To add fuel to the fire, Baelish adds that marrying the last remaining Stark gives the Boltons a stronger hold over the North than an alliance with a hated southern house. Baelish counsels patience and suggests letting the Boltons and Stannis fight each other, and when the victor is still recovering from the battle, step in and defeat him. He suggests that Cersei\u2019s uncle Kevan Lannister muster a force or have Jaime Lannister lead an army to the North. Cersei contemptuously claims that her uncle doesn\u2019t have the courage to lead an army, while Jaime is away on a \u201csensitive diplomatic mission.\u201d Baelish proposes that the soldiers of the Vale could fight instead but Cersei is unsure of Baelish\u2019s ability to lead an army. Baelish convinces her, stating that he \"lives to serve\". All Baelish wants in return is to be named Warden of the North. Cersei agrees to talk to the King about this.  Olenna Tyrell returns to King\u2019s Landing after learning of her grandson\u2019s arrest. Olenna tries to talk Cersei into releasing Loras. Cersei sticks to her claim that it was the Faith Militant who arrested Loras and she had nothing to do with it. Olenna warns Cersei that her actions have endangered the Lannister-Tyrell alliance \u2013 the very alliance that is supplying the capital with food. Cersei informs Olenna that the High Septon has called for a preliminary hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit and expresses confidence that Loras will be acquitted.  Margaery dragged away Margaery is arrested.  The High Sparrow interrogates Loras first, who denies the accusations against him. He then questions Margaery, who also denies any knowledge of it. The High Sparrow then calls in Olyvar, in character as Loras\u2019s \"squire\", who claims that the accusations against Loras are in fact true. Olyvar also testifies that Margaery walked in on them once, but didn\u2019t seem surprised. To support his testimony, Olyvar tells the High Sparrow of a birthmark Loras has that is shaped like Dorne, much to Loras' shock and fury. Deciding that this is more than enough evidence for a holy inquest, the High Sparrow has Loras arrested. Since Margaery bore false witness before the Gods, she is arrested too. As Margaery is forcefully dragged away, she calls out for Tommen, who is paralyzed with indecision, while Olenna contemptuous regards Cersei's barely contained smug expression.  In Winterfell At Winterfell, Sansa is joined by Myranda in her room. She offers to help Sansa take a bath, so she is presentable to Ramsay during the wedding. While she is washing Sansa's back, Myranda mentions three other girls whom Ramsay had been with, and how he ultimately victimized them after a while because they bored him. Seeing through her motives, Sansa startles Myranda by asking how long she has loved Ramsay. She coolly informs Myranda that she is a Stark of Winterfell and will not be intimidated by the likes of her, and dismisses her to finish her bath herself, though she is visibly shaken by Myranda's story.  Sansa-wedding Sansa is wed.  Later, when Reek comes to fetch Sansa for the wedding, she refuses to hold his arm, even after he pleads with her to do so, saying that Ramsay will punish him if she doesn\u2019t. Sansa coldly asks if he thinks she cares what Ramsay does to him, and strides past him. Then, in front of the Godswood, Reek gives Sansa away to Ramsay (who actually allows Reek to call himself Theon Greyjoy) during the wedding ceremony, which is officiated by Roose Bolton and attended by many Northern Lords. Later when they retreat to the bedroom, Ramsay first interrogates Sansa about her virginity, then orders her to take her clothes off. Reek turns to leave but Ramsay tells him he must stay, taunting him \u201cyou grew up with her as a girl, now watch her become a woman.\" Annoyed by Sansa's hesitancy, Ramsay angrily rips open the back of her dress and pushes her face-down over the side of the bed. As he unbuckles his clothes, Sansa obediently remains still but begins crying softly. Reek is visibly distraught and begins silently crying himself, as Ramsay proceeds to rape her, and forcibly consummate their marriage."], "review": null}, "47": {"id": "s05e07", "name": "The Gift", "script": "Did you kill Joffrey?

To forge a lasting bond with the people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family and reopen the fighting pits. It's a slave ship. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I will prove my worth. I want you to be my wife. We have to go, Myrcella. Now. Drop your weapons. We're going to have a baby. From the way she's carrying, it looks like a boy. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here. Sansa is in danger, even if she doesn't realize it.

First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black. Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all the brothers who have died fighting the wildlings. As always, thank you for your honesty. Safe travels, Lord Commander. Thank you, Sam. Oh, um It's dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the white walker. I hope you don't need them. Me, too. Yah. There he is. That laugh. Egg. Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember. His little brother Aegon. He became king. And before that, he was a jolly fellow, like this one. Get him south, Gillyflower. Before it's too late. Theon, wait. Not Theon, my lady. Reek. Help me. You're his wife now. Theon. Do what he says. Do what he says or he'll hurt you. He already hurts me every night. All day I'm locked in this room and every night he comes It can't be any worse. It can. It can always be worse. - What did he do to you? - Please. - You betrayed my family! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You have to help me. Theon, help me. He'll see us. You don't know him. My family still has friends in the North. All I need to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me. Climb to the top of the broken tower. Light this candle and put it in the window. - Promise me, Theon. - Reek! My name is Reek. Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands. Do you hear me? Theon promise me. Yes, Reek? Egg. Egg. Mother's looking for you. Egg. Get some sleep, Sam. You'll have to speak for him tomorrow. You don't know that. Get some sleep. I'll watch over him. I'm staying, too. He's always been good to me. I can't leave him now. Egg! Egg. I dreamed that I was old. His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King's Landing. A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn, and sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall, a dozen lord commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch is ended. And now his watch is ended. You're losing all your friends, Tarly. My beautiful wife. When my father told me we were marrying, I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You've made me very happy. Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He's a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle-tested. He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords to bolster his army. But this storm is a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in the frost. His army is out there now suffering in the snow. One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. You'll be my lady and Wardeness. But isn't your stepmother pregnant? What of it? What happens if she has a boy? Then I'll have a baby brother. But he'll be the heir. I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son. But you're a bastard. A trueborn will always have the stronger claim. I've been naturalized by a royal decree from-- Tommen Baratheon? Another bastard. Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born the bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. You didn't know? Yes, he's done very well for himself. Oh. I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady. Your northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave. Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband. Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start peeling them. But this one, her heart gave out before I even got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It's far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now. 40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears. What else? The Stormcrows rode off last night. Sellswords. Loyal to nothing but gold. We still have a hard march to Winterfell and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather. And? This isn't our time. We should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears. I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I'll become the King Who Ran. - Your Grace-- - Winter is coming. Those aren't just the Stark words. It's a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last? It's better to wait for the right time than risk everything. This is the right time and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat. But we go forward. Only forward. Your Grace. I've trusted in your visions and your prophecies for years. You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow. - I don't know what I saw. - You do know. Trust yourself. And you? Do you trust yourself? I trust in the Lord. Are you sure? I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Winterfell. I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground. But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. We don't have Robert's bastard here. No, we have someone better. And your blood runs through her veins. Have you lost your mind? Do you doubt me? Still? After all that you've seen. There must be another way. - Leeches or-- - There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. - To this decision. - She's my daughter. Get out. There's always some sort of grub on. A bit of mutton would be nice. A beauty from beyond the Wall. Where you going, love? Aren't we better-looking than the fat man? No, the question is is she pretty down south in the real world or is she pretty 'cause she's the only girl here? Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss. Come on, love, give us a kiss. - Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl, I wouldn't leave you alone. - One little kiss. - Come on, give him a kiss. A man gets lonely guarding the Wall. There's no need to be rude. We just want a little affection. Ooh. Get your hands off her. Brother Derek, Brother Brant, I believe you both have guard duty tonight. Sam the Slayer. You gonna slay me with that sword? Look at his hand shake. Gilly, go on. Get back to your room, lock the door. - I'm warning you. - Come on. Come on. Sam! You lying sack of shit. Killed a white walker, eh? You fat-ass fuck. Come on, get up. - No! - This your hero? This hog? Leave him alone! Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you? - Come on! - No! - Sam! Sam! Sam! - Come on! - Sam! Sam! - Come on. Right. I'll deal with this. - Turn her over. - All right. I said get your hands off her. You're gonna get yourself killed. Your lover Jon Snow's not here to save you. I killed a white walker, I killed a Thenn. I'll take my chances with you. Sam! - I'm all right. - You're not. Just a bit woozy. The next time you see something like that, you leave it alone. I will not. They would have-- I don't know what they would have done. I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come. No. No, no. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand. Don't be stupid, Sam. You're not a fighter. What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you? Just promise me whatever happens, you'll take care of Little Sam. But of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too. I need more water. Stay. Please? Am I hurting you? Are you sure? Oh, my! A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough or drunken pirate. This one's a Westerosi knight from an ancient house trained in sword and lance. He fought beside the stag king Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors. Do I have 14? Do I hear 16? Sold. Wait! You have to buy me as well. Why? We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too. He's funny. You have to give him that. You're right, he's funny. Thank you, my lord. Thank you. Yes. My lord, if I may. I've heard Meereen has become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now, if you were to fight freed men who'd be paid a wage-- There's your wages, funny man. Should last the rest of your life. These are warrior hands, not a serving girl's. How long before the King of Meereen comes to claim my pillow? Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that. I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king. Are you jealous? You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition? I do. You're right. My motivations are entirely impure. Doesn't make me wrong. You told me yourself I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies without come knocking, I need the city of Meereen behind me. I have no choice. Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice-- death or slavery. So what else can I do, hmm? Marry me instead. Even if I wanted to do such an inadvisable thing, I couldn't. Why not? You are queen. You can do what you like. No, I can't. Then you are the only person in Meereen who's not free. And I know I'm here to serve my queen and not give advice, but can I make one more suggestion? Of course. On the day of the great games, gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters and Worthy Masters you can find and slaughter them all. I am a queen, not a butcher. All rulers are either butchers or meat. You there. Where would I find the High Septon or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he's got? It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit. You should have the decency to stand when you speak to a lady. You should have the decency to kneel before the gods. Don't spar with me, little fellow. For me, it's the knees. - You? - Hips. Ah. A man of the people. Is that your game? It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her. The people always do the dirty work. Spare me the homilies. I can smell a fraud from a mile away. Useful talent. I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter. Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws, you will be punished. Don't you walk away from me. You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna. What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived. What, then? I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on sniffing it out. But I'm telling you a simple truth. I serve the gods. The gods demand justice. How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse? By the holy text, \"The Seven-Pointed Star.\" If you don't have one in your library, I'll give you my own. I've read \"The Seven-Pointed Star.\" Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws. Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists, and yet you punish Loras for shagging some perfumed ponce and Margaery for defending her brother? Yes. The gods' laws must be applied to all equally. If it's equality you want, so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who's to blame. Have you ever sowed the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few, we are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few Lady Olenna. Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love. She's in a prison cell and there is nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there is nothing I can do! No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control. Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had. You cannot blame yourself for fate. Your father, your brother, your grandfather-- I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world. Kissed their heads after they'd gone. I'll call in the army. I'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I'll start a war if I have to. You know as well as I do who the first casualty of that war would be. I love her. I love her and I can't help her. We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair. I will speak with the High Sparrow. There must be something he-- Let me talk to him on your behalf. The king cannot sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic. You will try to help her? I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's. Your happiness is all I want in this world. - I know. - No, you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. You are all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world. My boy. My only boy. Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's well-being. You looked different when I left. You had more hair. And more hands. - How's Trystane? - He'll be all right. I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way. Why is it happening at all? Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne's too dangerous for you. - I've come to take you home. - This is my home. This has been my home for years. I didn't want to come here, but she told me to. I did what she said. I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back? It's for your own good. These are complicated matters. No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple. I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here. - I don't understand. - Of course you don't. You don't know me.  Brothers, O brothers, my days here are done   The Dornishman's taken my life   But what does it matter   For all men must die  And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife   I have, I've tasted the Dornishman's wife.  He's got a good voice. We're lucky he's a singer. If he were a fighter, we might have been in trouble. It's against my code to hurt a woman. It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code. I wouldn't say you beat me. How's your arm? Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar. You think you're leaving Dorne? No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world. Thank you. I said Dornish women. I didn't say you. I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen? I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms. Name one more beautiful than I am. Well, now, in King's Landing, there was an absolutely gorgeous There was a what? In King's Landing, you were saying? Was I? There was a woman more beautiful than I am. Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier. How's your arm now? You seem concerned with it. You must really like me. And how about your head? My head? My head? You don't even want to know what's going on in-- Your nose is bleeding. It's nothing. It's the dry air. My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshai. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death. The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world? You. Sorry? Who? You. Don't drop it. I think you're very handsome as well. - I'm sorry about the locale. - No, you're not. It felt like the safest place. Not for your clientele, clearly. It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to. Desires that didn't even exist until we invented them. You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you? The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell. Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital as soon as things started to go wrong. - I promise you-- - I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. If my house should fall, I will have nothing to hide. And if I should meet with some accident here at your broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all this? Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her. And what did she want? A piece of information she knew that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you. What kind of gift? The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man. Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the great games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon, it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you do happen to triumph here, you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. This is the day your lives actually start to mean something. You and you. You. You two. You, you, and you. Up. - Valar morghulis. - Valar dohaeris. Prepare yourselves. Sitting through the great games will be bad enough. For generations in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds of the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence. Move yourselves. Your Grace. Your future Grace. You honor us all. Stand there. Stand straight. That's the fucking queen. We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen. We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen. Fight! I think I've seen enough. Your Grace, it is a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged. I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions. What are you doing? Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth. Get him out of my sight. Khaleesi, please. I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift. It's true. He has. Who are you? I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister. This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the High Sparrow. But I fear the Faith has left reason behind. I know you did this. We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods. Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern, you're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me. You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down. I don't want to see you again. I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep. Though I suppose your isolation will end when your trial begins. Leave. Yes. I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever. Get out, you hateful bitch! Sleep well, sister. Thank you, Boake. - You saw her? - Yes. - And? - Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now? Well, she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they're guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith. Who will stand judge? Seven septons as it was in all trials before the Targaryens. Will you be one of them? I will. If one or both of them were to confess before the trial Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy. And what does the Mother's mercy entail? It depends upon the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition. Thank you, High Septon, for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven. Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing? I think I may have heard at one point. Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him. Who carved this altar? - Do you know? - I'm afraid I don't. No one does. There's no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel. No, the people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on those who came after them the way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there. Hmm. Their faith was clean. Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains. Something simple and solid and true. The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away. Their lies knocked down. Their true hearts laid bare for all to see. And so it will be for all of us. High and low alike. What will we find when we strip away your finery? A young man came to us not long ago. Broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away. So much weighing him down. But piece by piece, he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin. Now his soul is so light, he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird. Hmm. And he has much to say about you. Move. Let me go immediately. You will order her to let me go. I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! Get your filthy hands off me! Have you lost your mind? I am the queen! Let me go! Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.", "summary": ["Plot Jon prepares for conflict. Sansa tries to talk to Theon. Brienne waits for a sign. Stannis remains stubborn. Jaime attempts to reconnect with family.  Summary At the Wall Jon departs for Hardhome with Tormund and a group of rangers, after speaking with Ser Alliser Thorne and Sam. Before they leave, Sam gives Jon some of his dragonglass weapons, reminding him of their use against the White Walkers. Afterward, Sam and Gilly visit Maester Aemon, who is bedridden and dying from old age. Gilly brings her baby Little Sam for him to hold and cheer him up a little. Aemon happily notes that her son has a laugh just like his little brother Egg (King Aegon V) had when he was a baby. In a moment of clarity, Aemon gravely warns Gilly that she and her son must leave the Wall while they still can, before winter comes (and the White Walkers with it). The couple stay as Aemon's condition steadily deteriorates during the night, and he fades in and out of consciousness. Gilly urges Sam to get some sleep while she watches over Aemon, as she predicts that he'll have to conduct the funeral in the daytime, but Sam insists on being there for the old maester who's always been good to him. Near the end Aemon wakes up delirious from a dream, still lost in memory from his youth: he calls out to his brother Egg, and says that he had a strange dream that he was an old man. Aemon passes away soon afterwards.  507 Samwell Gilly sex scene Samwell loses his virginity with Gilly.  In the courtyard of Castle Black, Sam eulogizes Aemon before lighting his funeral pyre, declaring for all to hear that he was the blood of the dragon - \"but now his watch is ended.\" Ser Alliser quietly warns him that one by one, Sam is losing all his friends. Afterward, Gilly is attacked in the dining hall by two brothers, but Sam and Jon's direwolf, Ghost, come to her rescue. Sam is badly beaten, and Gilly tends to his injuries. Still in grief at Aemon's death and impressed by Sam defending her, Gilly climbs on top of him and they have sex.  In the North At Winterfell, Reek brings food to Sansa. She begs him for help, telling him how she has been locked in her bedchamber since her wedding and is visited by Ramsay every night and he forces himself on her. Reek simply tells her to obey Ramsay or else he would do worse things to her. Sansa asks what Ramsay did to Reek to break him to such an extent, but he can't bring himself to tell her. He tries to leave but Sansa grabs and reminds him that he betrayed her family, making Reek apologize profusely. Sansa informs him that her family still has allies in the North and tells him to light a candle at the top of the Broken Tower which will signal them that she is in danger. When Reek refuses to do it, Sansa reminds him of his true name, Theon Greyjoy, and makes him promise that he'll help her. Reek hesitantly agrees. He trudges through the snow with the candle, up a flight of stairs and into Ramsay\u2019s room.  Later, Sansa is taken to see Ramsay on the ramparts, which are still under construction. While he is distracted, Sansa grabs a workman's tool lying on a nearby barrel and pockets it. Ramsay speaks of his thoughts on how they will easily defeat Stannis's army since their soldiers, unlike Stannis's, are trained to fight in the snow, and how he'll one day be the Lord of Winterfell and the Warden of the North.  Sansa reminds him of the unborn baby, who, if a boy, will have a stronger claim on the North since he'll be a true-born. Ramsay tells her that he is Roose Bolton's eldest son, legitimized by the king, who Sansa reminds him is another bastard. Ramsay is obviously angered by Sansa's remarks, but doesn't act on it, simply stating that bastards can rise in the world too, informing her of Jon's appointment as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Ramsay then brings up the reason why he summoned her, and shows her the crucified and partly flayed corpse of the old woman who promised to help Sansa if she lit a candle in the Broken Tower. Ramsay then reveals to Sansa that Reek, who seems miserable to have squashed Sansa's only hope of an escape, came to him and told him everything. Sansa chokes back tears as a gleeful Ramsay orders his men to take her back to her chamber. Meanwhile, Brienne stares intently at Winterfell castle from her room in the inn, waiting for the sign to rescue Sansa.  Stannis inside his command tent Stannis inside his command tent with Davos and Melisandre, en route to Winterfell.  Stannis's troops make camp during a violent snowstorm. Davos Seaworth meets with Stannis and informs him that forty horses died the previous night and more will die come sunset. The Stormcrows, a sellsword company, have fled in the night. Davos thinks that they should go back to Castle Black and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food, but Stannis stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to Castle Black because he will not risk being known as \"the King who Ran\". As winter will soon arrive, they also run the risk of being stuck at Castle Black for years, during which the Boltons will regain their strength. Seeing no other way to convince Stannis otherwise, Davos leaves.  Stannis asks Melisandre if she is sure of their victory at Winterfell. Melisandre assures him, reminding him that he also saw the vision of his victory in the flames, but Stannis is not so sure what he saw anymore. Melisandre reassures him that her visions will come true, but also states that a sacrifice, one with King's blood, must be made in order to ensure their victory, implying that they sacrifice Shireen. Stannis is infuriated by the suggestion and orders her to leave.  In Dorne The Gift 07 Myrcella and Jaime talk about Trystane.  Prince Doran has Areo Hotah bring Myrcella to Jaime in the quarters where he is confined, as Jaime is concerned for her safety. Displaying a somewhat more critical mind than her brothers, Myrcella is suspicious about Jaime's \"diplomatic mission\" to bring her back to King's Landing, to which Jaime only replies that there are \"complicated matters\" involved. Myrcella flatly refuses to return with him, stating her intent to marry Trystane.  Bronn is singing The Dornishman's Wife in his jail cell, while in the adjoining cell, the Sand Snakes listen with a mix of annoyance from Obara and Nymeria and amusement from Tyene. After he finishes, the two parties trade barbs, and Tyene inquires about Bronn's arm, which she cut with her daggers during their earlier fight, with Bronn brushing it off as \"a new scar\". The two begin to talk about Tyene's beauty, which Bronn dismisses until she begins to disrobe. Bronn stares intently, and begins to change his mind about her. Tyene once again inquires about his arm, and then his head, at which point Bronn's nose starts bleeding and his vision blurs.  Bronn poisoned Bronn is poisoned by Tyene Sand.  Bronn collapses and tries to play off his sudden illness, but Tyene reveals that her daggers were coated with a slow-acting poison called The Long Farewell, and her attempts to seduce Bronn were to get his heart pumping faster, thereby allowing the poison to act quicker. She points to an ampoule on her necklace, which contains the antidote, but only offers to give it to Bronn on the condition that he agrees that she is the most beautiful woman in the world. Growing weaker, Bronn barely manages to reply affirmatively, and she tosses the ampoule to a relieved Bronn. Tyene smiles smugly at him and remarks that she finds him handsome as well, before re-robing and sitting down next to her mildly amused half-sisters.  In King's Landing In the Great Sept of Baelor, Lady Olenna meets with the High Sparrow to discuss the imprisonment of her grandchildren, Ser Loras and Queen Margaery. Although they briefly bond over the infirmities of age, she demands that he release them and he declines, stating they will be punished for their crimes. The High Sparrow tells her that the Gods' Laws must be applied to everyone equally. Olenna first tries to bribe him, but learning that he cannot be bought, threatens to end the Tyrell support for the capital by ending shipments of food. Again the High Sparrow is unfazed, remarking that the nobility of Westeros have forgotten they are outnumbered by the common folk and tells Olenna to ponder what happens when the many stop fearing the few. Returning to her palanquin, Olenna receives a letter bearing Petyr Baelish's seal.  Meanwhile, in the Red Keep, King Tommen rails over his inability to help Margaery. He wants to start a war for Margaery, declaring his love for her to a dumbstruck Cersei. To maintain control of the situation, she offers to speak with the High Sparrow for him and advocate for Margaery and Loras's release. Although clearly suspicious, the still-overwhelmed Tommen agrees.  Littlefinger meets with Olenna in his ransacked brothel, where they share a tense conversation. Olenna reminds him of the role they both played in Joffrey's murder, and that, should her House fall, she will have no reason to keep his involvement a secret. Littlefinger explains why he returned to King's Landing - he dared not refuse Cersei's summons, and was obliged to give her information. He tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave Cersei: a handsome young man \u2014 implied, in this instance, to be Lancel.  In the Sept's cells, Cersei meets with Margaery and brings her food but Margaery refuses, revealing that she knows her mother-in-law is responsible for having her and Loras imprisoned. Cersei, fearful of being overheard, denies this. Margaery mocks Cersei for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her, going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme, she doesn't understand innocence and decency well enough to fake them, which Margaery suspects is why Tommen loves her, Margaery, and was willing to send Cersei back to Casterly Rock. Cersei, concealing her fury, tells Margaery her trial will soon begin and that her son needs his mother more than ever. Margaery throws the stew at Cersei, and yells at her to get out. Cersei leaves the cell, smiling smugly at Margaery.  On her way out, a still gleeful Cersei meets with the High Sparrow in a chapel that predates the Great Sept. The pair briefly discuss the legal process that Margaery and Loras will face. As the conversation goes on, however, it's clear that the High Sparrow is about to turn the tables on Cersei. When Brother Lancel appears, Cersei realizes what is about to happen, and her triumphant smile begins to crack. The High Sparrow has an irate Cersei taken into custody by a group of Septas who ignore Cersei's threats and lock her in a cell.  In Meereen Jorah is sold by Malko to Yezzan zo Qaggaz. Before Yezzan leaves, Tyrion convinces him that Jorah and he are a team, and is also bought. In Meereen, Daenerys and Daario discuss her impending marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq. After rejecting his suggestion that she marry him instead, Daario advises her that, on the day the fighting pits are reopened, she should gather all the Great, Wise and Good Masters and kill them. Dany is reluctant to do so, as she believes it will give her the reputation of a butcher, to which Daario replies that \"all rulers are either butchers or meat\".  The Gift 09 Dany views the fighters training for Daznak's Pit.  Yezzan takes his fighters to Meereen, to test them in the lower pits and seek out those who are worthy to fight in the Great Pit of Daznak. They fight in front of a reluctant Daenerys, as Hizdahr has convinced her that Meereen's ruler occasionally makes the rounds to the lower pits ahead of the main tournament. Jorah enters the Pits early, upon realizing that she is watching and will be repulsed by what she's seeing, and elbows down Yezzan who tried to berate him. Jorah easily defeats the other fighters without killing them, impressing Dany enough to prevent her from leaving. When he reveals his identity, however, her face swiftly twists into a scowl and she orders him taken away. Before the Unsullied can comply, Jorah declares that he brought her a gift, and Tyrion enters the arena and reveals his identity to the astonished Queen.

If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine? You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister on the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time. So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family? Into your service? Your Grace, we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service. If you'd rather return to the fighting pits, just say the word. When I was a young man, I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who'd been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later, the most well-informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least. And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you? Because you cannot build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule. The strengths and weaknesses of the houses that will either join or oppose you. I will have a very large army and very large dragons. Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King, I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name. If that is indeed what you are. So you want to advise me? Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned. I know. Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises? Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember ever seeing a sane man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you. Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal? Yes. Many opportunities. And did he? No, not until forced to do so. He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth. An unpleasant truth to be sure, but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him. So I should kill him? A ruler who kills those devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do. Remove Ser Jorah from the city. Confess. My son. Let me speak to-- Confess. I meant it. My face will be the last thing you see-- My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan. When I was eight, I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters. I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more. It took a while, but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning, I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on her way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane-- Turn left onto Ragman Lane where I do most of my trade. Lanna is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many-Faced God. How will she serve him? She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor. What will she do there? She will see. See what? How can a man tell a girl this? If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her. Oysters, clams, and cockles! Oysters, clams, and cockles! Oysters, clams, and cockles! Your oysters fresh? Best in the city. You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you? Mm. Very nice. Give me four with vinegar. It's my 18th voyage. Returned from all of them without a scratch on me. Can't do it. Please, I've three children. Without me Here, take it. You have to. I've three children. - What will they do? - Come on. They've nothing without me. Please, you have to! Please, you don't understand! Please! The man is a gambler. He wages that a sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life. So why would a captain make the wager in the first place? A girl tells a man that she has seen. If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money. But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides he does not have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse? The Many-Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks. A man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not. A girl named Lanna will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself. And then what? A gift for the thin man. She's not ready. Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not. And if she's not? It is all the same to the Many-Faced God. The trial will take place soon. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you. The charges? Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert. All lies. Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that the Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason. I wish you had said it sooner. Is there any word from Jaime? No, I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council. Tell him I need to speak to him. I implored him to visit you, but he would not. What about my son, the king? If you can visit me, then surely the king Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken them well. He remains in his chambers. His servants often find his food in the hall left untouched. You need to talk to him. You need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me, come and see his mother. He-- I tried, Your Grace. He wouldn't see me. He won't see anyone. I can't stay here. There is a way, Your Grace. A way out. Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing. I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness. Good-bye, my queen. The work continues. Why? Why, Theon? I'm not Theon. There is no Theon. - Reek. - Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek? I was helping you. You wanted to escape. There is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him and caught him and strapped him to a cross and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left. Good. If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family. If I could do what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would. I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. - Killed those boys. - They weren't \"those boys.\" They were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers. You've known them since they were born. They weren't. They were only-- Only what? - I can't. - Tell me. I can't, not unless the master says. - Tell me. They weren't what? - They weren't-- Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face, Theon. Tell me that they weren't your brothers! They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know. You didn't? Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon? I can't talk to you anymore. Theon, you have to tell me. Do you have any idea where-- Not Theon! Reek! Our scouts tell us he's got no more than 6,000 men. More than half of those are mounted, however. And how high do Stannis's horses jump? Our walls have been fully repaired. The gates have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny. You disagree? Stannis isn't from the North. You are, Father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders. And what do you recommend? That we not sit and wait for Stannis to decide what sort of fight this is going to be. That we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows. A smart commander does not abandon a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls, they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep, we couldn't get an army through to engage them even if we wanted to. I don't need an army. I need 20 good men. So, have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service? Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed? It's probably my safest option. I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done. And what would your father have done? My father, who publically sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear. Is that why you killed him? Someday, if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this. I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name. So, here we sit. Two terrible children of two terrible fathers. I'm terrible? I've heard stories. Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible? - To see if you were the right kind of terrible. - Which kind is that? The kind that prevents your people from being even more so. Well, I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment. Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, gods forbid. She ended up having him killed. Perhaps it won't come to that. It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all. Varys? King Robert's spymaster? Yes, he's the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself. Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the Spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me. He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things as well, things he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib. But you trust him? Yes, oddly. He may be the only person in the world I trust. Except my brother. The brother who killed my father? That's the one. Perhaps I will have you killed after all. Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. If you chop off my head, well, my final days were interesting. I'm not going to kill you. No? Banish me? No. So if I'm not going to be murdered and I'm not going to be banished-- You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences. Advise you on what? How to get what I want. The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else. If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool. I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong, where you can do the most good. I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home. When you get back to your home, who supports you? The common people. Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like? Ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone. Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well. Our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining members of House Lannister will never back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either. His entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, not enough. Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that one's on top. And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground. It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel. You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it. I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel. You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won. - You struck me. - Have me flogged if it makes you happy. But I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit, how much can you sell me for? You're a free man. You could have gone anywhere. Why did you come back? Let me fight for her and I belong to you. Thirsty? Confess. I'll get out of here, you realize, before long. Confess. I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court. Confess. Or I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable. And all I do is sit here imagining hideous ways for you to die. Does it hurt? No. Good. How are you? I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face. You know what I mean. I'm good. - Are you scared? - A little. Me, too. - Who's there? -  Olly. Oh. Come in. I heard what happened. Oh, not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural. Figured you were hungry. Oh, you're a good lad. Wanted to ask you something if you've got the time. I need to check on baby Sam. Now then, how can I help? - It's about the Lord Commander. - Yes? He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village. We've been fighting them for years. This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why is he saving them? Wildlings are people. Just like us, there are good ones and bad ones. The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village. -  Oh, Olly. - How can he trust him? I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers. And they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time, we'll need every last man we can find. But what if we let the wildlings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep? Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run. You believe that? With all my heart. Try not to worry, Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back. Turn us about! You trust me, Jon Snow? Does that make me a fool? We're fools together now. Lord of Bones. Been a long time. Last time I saw you, the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened? War. War? You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by some southern king. We should gather the elders, find somewhere quiet to talk. You don't give the orders here. I'm not giving an order. Why aren't you in chains? He's not my prisoner. No? What is he? We're allies. You fucking traitor. You fight for the crows now? I don't fight for the crows. We're not here to fight. We're here to talk. Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund? And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock? Gather the elders and let's talk. My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700-foot wall between you and what's out there. You built that wall to keep us out. Since when do the crows give two shits if we live? In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's free folk or crow. We're all the same to them, meat for their army. But together we can beat them. Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe. It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us. Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker. - You saw this? - No. But I trust the man. There are old stories about dragonglass. There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds. And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them? Come with me and I'll share these weapons. Come with you where? There are good lands south of the Wall. The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands. I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch. He wanted a new life for his people, for you. We're prepared to give you that new life. If? If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins. Where is Mance? - He died. - How? I put an arrow through his heart. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes. Hey, none of you saw Mance die. I did. The southern king who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send us a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What he did took courage. And that's what we need today, the courage to make peace with men we've been killing for generations. I lost my father, my uncle, and two brothers fighting the damn crows. I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us. And even then it may not be enough, but at least we'll give the fuckers a fight. You vouch for this man, Tormund? He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us and we need him. My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow. So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead. I'll never trust a man in black. But I trust you, Tormund. If you say this is the way, we're with you. This is the way. I'm with Tormund. We stay here, we're dead men. At least with King Crow, there's a chance. Tormund. Keep that new life you want to give us. And keep your glass, King Crow. As soon as you get on his ships, they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy. I fucking hate Thenns. - Move it. - Be careful. - Move 'em along, now. - Cast-off time. That's it, come on. How many are with us? I'm not good at counting. We're leaving too many behind. The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together? And he knew them better than I ever will. They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around. - Get yourselves ready. - Aye! Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge. You listen to her. Take her. There you are. I want to go with you. I need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you. I promise. Go on. Another one. Keep moving. We'll meet you out there. Won't be able to take that on the boat. It's too big. -  That's the last one! -  Three more! Move on! There's more dragonglass everywhere. I've got some more daggers over here. Put that dagger in his bag. Uh Steady! Shut the gates. Close the gates! Shut the gates! Wait! - Open the gate! - Let us in! Help us! Please open it! Open the gate! Ready your arrows! - Wait! Wait! - Keep in line! Keep in line! Get in line! Get to the front! Go on, shoot it! - Wait, wait! - Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line! Lord Commander! Get them to the ship and come back for me! - But you'll never make-- - Now! - Let me on! - Let me on! - Bloody fucking move! - Let go! You should be on one of those boats. So should you. My little girls got on. They're gonna let them pass the Wall even if you're not there? You have my word. I've given orders. Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders. If they get through, everyone dies. Night's Watch, with me! Move! Move! Move! No, no! - Tormund, the sleigh! - Okay, okay! The dragonglass. You and me, then! Go! Get the glass. Come on! The dragonglass. Fuck the glass! We are gonna die here! Oh, fuck! Tormund, run! Wun Wun, to the sea. Quickly! -  Faster, faster! -  Run, run! Quickly! - Quickly, row! Row! - Go, go, come on! Let's go! Now, now! Come on, row!", "summary": ["Plot Arya makes progress in her training. Sansa confronts an old friend. Cersei struggles. Jon travels.  Summary In Meereen Tyrion-jorah-s5e8 Ser Jorah and Tyrion are brought before Daenerys in the Great Pyramid.  In the Throne Room, Daenerys ponders on what to do with Tyrion and Jorah. She asks Tyrion why she shouldn't kill him, since the Lannisters are enemies to her House. He claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the Lannisters as well. Daenerys isn't convinced that killing one's own family is a good reputation for someone in her service. Tyrion counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service. Ordered to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world, he explains how he learned about her own story from rumors and from Varys. He says that she \u2013 a lost girl born in a storm, who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde, an effective army, conquer three cities, break the slave trade and hatch three dragons \u2013 might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then. He adds that Daenerys needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons, as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of Westeros.  She eventually agrees to spare his life, but asks what to do about Ser Jorah. She seems poised to fulfill her promise of killing him if she saw him again, as it would not do at all for a queen not to keep her word. Tyrion defends Jorah, commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her, but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for King Robert and that therefore he cannot be trusted to stand by her side. But, he argues, just as a queen should keep true to her oaths, she should also not kill those devoted to her.  Daenerys exiles Jorah from the city. Contemplating his greyscale, Jorah returns to Yezzan zo Qaggaz and offers to fight for him. He promises to lead Yezzan's team to the Great Pit and win the tournament for the Queen \u2013 after that Yezzan can make a fortune selling Jorah on the black market.  TyrionandDaenerys I'm going to break the wheel.  Later, Tyrion and Daenerys sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions. When Tyrion mentions what a horrible father Tywin was, Daenerys admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father. Daenerys is curious about the circumstances of Tyrion's murder of Tywin. He wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her, but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from.  They discuss the role of Varys in their stories and Tyrion assures Daenerys he trusts him, and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago. Tyrion was convinced by Varys that she could be a ruler who deserves his support.  Daenerys decides Tyrion will remain as her adviser, but confiscates the wine, as a drunk is of no use to her. When Tyrion asks Daenerys what she wants to be advised on, Tyrion nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the Iron Throne. He suggests that she might want to stay in Slaver's Bay and build a new kingdom for herself in Meereen, complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage. She assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things, and make sure the slave trade stays broken, but Essos is not her \"home.\" Tyrion asks who will support her in Westeros to which Daenerys somewhat idealistically answers that the common people will support her. Tyrion generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't); Tyrion then asks Daenerys what ruling Meereen, with the support of only the common folk while not having the support of the rich, was like (Meereen has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the Great Masters and the smallfolk), and extends this to Westeros and its Great Houses. He notes that Houses Targaryen and Stark are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their \"two terrible fathers\". Neither House Lannister nor House Baratheon of Dragonstone will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the Targaryens. Tyrion says that this leaves House Tyrell who might be willing to switch sides due to Cersei's recent schemes against them but that is still not enough. Daenerys stubbornly likens the Great Houses, including her own House Targaryen, to the spokes on a wheel, one on top and then others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. Tyrion sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel, but Daenerys clarifies that she plans to break it.  In Braavos Arya dance of dragons Arya, posing as \"Lanna\", sells oysters, clams, and cockles on the canal streets.  Arya assumes the identity of Lanna, a clam-seller, and shows Jaqen H'ghar she can convincingly become a different person, developing an elaborate and very believable backstory. The Faceless Man sends her, as Lanna, to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as \"the thin man\" refuse a contract to insure a man's boat, leaving the man in desperate circumstances. Jaqen explains the thin man's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements; when a ship captain dies at sea, he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family, but he often doesn't. Jaqen instructs her to kill him, and hands her a \"gift\" for the thin man \u2014 a vial of poison. The waif is skeptical of Arya/Lanna's success.  In King's Landing Septa Unella continues to demand Cersei to \"confess\" in return for her freedom. She remains defiant, despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst. Qyburn visits her in her cell, and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication, treason, incest, and Robert's murder, all of which Cersei furiously dismisses as \"lies.\" Qyburn tells her that Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned Kevan Lannister to serve as Hand of the King. Kevan has, at this point in time, already arrived, and he has refused to visit her in prison. Qyburn also tells her that Tommen has become reclusive, refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state. Before leaving, he tells her \"the work continues\" on their secret project.  In Winterfell Sansa 3328436b Theon tells Sansa about Bran and Rickon.  A bitter and determined Sansa confronts Reek about his latest betrayal. Reek apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping Ramsay. He tells her that Theon Greyjoy tried to escape but Ramsay caught him and tortured him until there was no Theon left. Sansa coldly expresses approval and reminds Reek of the role he played in her family's downfall, and that if she could do to him what Ramsay did, she would. Reek shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things, specifically killing \"those boys.\" Enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as \"those boys\" rather than Bran and Rickon, Sansa vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air, forcing Reek to finally admit that they were not in fact Bran and Rickon, only two farm boys. Stunned by this admission, Sansa's anger towards Reek cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone, calling him Theon again, he breaks down and runs out the room, crying, \"Not Theon! Reek!\"  Roose Bolton maintains that his army must wait inside Winterfell, thus starving out Stannis' forces, as Winterfell had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege. Such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the Baratheon force and break them down. Ramsay, on the other hand, has a plan to defeat Stannis decisively and asks his father to lend him just \"20 good men.\"  At the Wall Gilly continues to tend Sam's wounds. Olly enters with some food, having heard what happened. Once Gilly leaves, Olly expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings, particularly Tormund, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures Olly that Jon knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the Night's Watch nor Westeros stands a chance against the White Walkers. Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make, however unpopular, and then tells him not to worry, as Jon always comes back. Olly appears unconvinced.  At Hardhome Hardhome-boat Jon, Tormund and Edd arrive at Hardhome.  Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane, along with other members of the Night's Watch and the Free Folk, arrive at the wildling town Hardhome to convince the rest of the wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the White Walkers and their armies of Wights.  Lord of Bones Dead (Hardhome) The Lord of Bones beaten to death by Tormund.  Insisting on never being an ally with a Crow, The Lord of Bones insults Tormund for being at the side of an enemy like Jon Snow. Tormund seizes the Lord's staff and beats his former ally to death with it. The wildling elders decide to gather in the Townshall to hear out Jon's proposal; an alliance between the Free Folk and the Night's Watch in the face of their common enemy, the undead.  Having not seen Mance Rayder since he was taken prisoner at The Wall, the Wildlings question his whereabouts. Snow reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow. The group is infuriated, but as they move in to kill him, Tormund vouches for him, describing how Rayder was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from Stannis Baratheon, and how Snow defied Stannis by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames. Some leaders are convinced, such as Karsi and the giant Wun Wun, but others like the Thenn warrior Loboda begin to leave. Jon offers them the dragonglass daggers, telling them that his friend had killed a White Walker with one. The Wildlings still seem unconvinced.  Wun Weg (Hardhome) Wun Weg examining the dragon glass.  While approximately five thousand Free Folk gather to set sail to the Wall, the Night's Watch starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent. Edd approaches Wun Wun who holds one of the daggers, examining it curiously. The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks Edd \"The fuck you looking at?\" in the giants' rudimentary form of the Old Tongue. Edd walks away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead. Suddenly, dogs begin barking and the sounds of a storm are heard. Recognizing the sign of approaching White Walkers, Loboda orders the gates of Hardhome to be shut, abandoning many of the Free Folk on the other side to their fate. As the storm reaches the village, the screams of the people shut outside the walls of Hardhome quickly fall silent. A moment later, a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls. Jon, Tormund, Loboda and Karsi fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships. Eddison Tollett, Wun Wun, and others are trapped inside the townhall, which is set upon by wights and catches fire \u2013 in the confusion, the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost.  Loboda Stabbed (Hardhome) Loboda impaled through the gut by a White Walker.  On top of a hill overlooking Hardhome, several White Walkers mounted on undead horses observe the battle, including the Night King. Noticing them, and realizing the need for dragonglass, Jon and Loboda go to the burning townhall, only to be confronted by a White Walker warrior. While Loboda faces the threat, Jon Snow goes for the dragonglass. Loboda is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the White Walker's ice blade. Jon just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the White Walker. Jon retrieves Longclaw and defends himself against the White Walker and both combatants are astonished to see the Valyrian steel remain intact after colliding with the White Walker's blade.  WW-fight Jon kills a White Walker.  Seizing the opportunity, Jon strikes the White Walker, shattering his body into fragments of ice, confirming that Valyrian steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass. The Night King, watching the entire battle from a distance, seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events. Meanwhile, Karsi fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children. Frozen by the horror, she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death. The White Walkers deploy another large host of wights, letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above Hardhome. Jon, Edd, Tormund and the remaining defenders flee for their lives.  White walker hardhome The Night King raises the dead wildlings into wights.  Shielded by Wun Wun, who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them, they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance. As Jon and the others look on in horror, the Night King raises his arms triumphantly; all around it, the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights, including Karsi. The Night King and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat. "], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605It was phenomenal. Game of Thrones remains to be the most compelling show I've seen in quite some time. Tyrion and DanaerysTyrion has finally done what no man has dared to do before: Call out Jorah on being obviously and desperately in love with Dany. I think Tyrion was also correct in saying that Dany ought to allow him to live, because punishing subjects who love her doesn't exactly garner affection. However, Jorah is a liability, and his love for her has caused him to make some absolutely absurd choices and he's blinded by it. He's reached a point of being pathetic in his desperation to remain in her life, and I'm just waiting for her to have no choice but to kill him, since she's now spared him twice. Tyrion and Dany are well-matched, and their banter is fun to watch. I haven't found Dany to be a compelling leader for a few seasons now, and I'm hoping that Tyrion can show her the ropes and make her someone worth following. She's got a long way to go. Jorah later goes and sells himself back into slavery for no real reason, but he's also got nothing to lose since he was touched by the Stone Men.King's LandingKarma is in town, and is giving Cersei exactly what she deserves. Maybe it's just me, but her current fate was so predictable that I'm amazed she couldn't have seen it coming. The rumor that Cersei and Jamie are lovers seems to be spreading like wildfire and Cersei unleashed the religious zealots to punish people having \"unnatural\" sex. Considering the fact that she's been having sex with her brother for practically her entire life, you would think she'd want to keep more control over the Sparrows. I'll be interested to see where this goes. As Tyrion advised her last season, Cersei is not nearly as smart as she thinks she is. AryaI love seeing her character evolve. Maisie has become quite a strong actress since the first season. The idea is that Arya must lose/reject her identity, but I'm not sure I think she'll ever be able to commit fully to it. It's interesting to see the interactions between Jaquen and the other woman there who obviously has reservations about how quickly Arya is moving forward in the Game of Faces. I think it suits her, though. Her natural personality drives her to seek retribution for injustices. Jaquen having her learn about the thin man at the docks in order to ultimately kill him to restore the balance absolutely seems in line with what she seems to want to offer the world. There are still some people left on her Valar morghoulis list, and I want to know if she'll ever be able to complete the list since it becomes irrelevant if she's no longer Arya Stark. WinterfellDark Sansa is back and she's doing her best to regain control of her circumstances. The girl is nothing if not resilient. She only has a very brief scene, but she does discover that her brothers Bran and Rickorn are still alive...or at a minimum, they weren't killed by Theon. I'm hoping that Sansa sticks with Petyr's plan to claim the North and asks Brienne to track down the boys. Brienne needs a purpose, and I don't think she'll be useful to Sansa at all and her dramatic loyalty is only going to get Sansa and/or herself killed.The Boltons discuss war strategies with Stannis moving closer to trying to seize Winterfell. Right now, I think it's anyone's game. Ramsay is certifiably insane and I think he's rather arrogant about his abilities. He can torture people like a pro, but I'm not sure I'd expect his war tactics to be exceptional. Ramsay wants to take 20 good men and attack Stannis, and he expects to win. Roose would prefer to remain in Winterfell behind the safety of the walls. The scenes were short and didn't seem to matter much. Night's WatchSam and Gilly:Super cute...Super awkward. I don't trust Olly at ALL. He is asking all sorts of questions that make me seriously suspect that one day he's going to up and decide to try to kill Jon. Maybe it's just me, but that kid give me the creeps. Jon & Co.\u00a0I can't even begin to describe how eerie Hardhome was. Every single moment was tense. The woman from Pitch Perfect 2 in Das Sound Machine showed up and played the Wildling woman with the kids she put in the boat and told Jon he needed to keep his word. It was a sweet moment, but I knew as soon as she put her kids in that boat that she wasn't making it out of there alive. When the Walkers suddenly show up, it was absolutely fascinating, and I can't help but feel that every single time they show up, the magic explaining them changes. The first time Sam runs into them on the glacier, they seem to be a hoard of zombies similar to the Walking Dead. Then in the woods with Gilly, all the crows show up just before the walker does. This time around, it seemed to be this ominous snow storm that preceded their arrival and they moved with ridiculous speed and ruthlessness, and once this ominous snow storm blew through and the Wildlings closed the gates, the hundreds of people on the wrong side of the gate seemed to disappear without a sound. I'd love some consistency and some explanation. Right now, I don't buy into their mythology and their portrayal because it changes so constantly. The net result of this venture to save the Wildlings is that they save a good number (though probably only about 25%) of the Wildlings there, the army of the (un)dead gained a TON of new members, Jon lost the dragonglass leaving them relatively defenseless, and Jon's sword (Valeryean steel) is evidently able to kill a Walker. You could feel the weight of this development during the episode, and I'm suspicious that it is another breadcrumb about Jon's parentage.Overall, a thrilling episode.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I love this episode, I love it, I love it! It has everything that makes Game of Thrones so exciting. It has Tyrion doing what he's best at, it has Arya becoming active again, it has heroic moments, terrifying images and important plot revelations. And it's not even episode 9 yet! So let's break it down again.Jorah and Tyrion have a meeting with the queen, where Tyrion has to convince Daenerys to let him stay as an advisor. She immediately asks him for advice on what's to be done with Ser Traitor. So on the one hand you have a dwarf from a family who murdered your own family, stole your throne, spied on you while you were in Essos and stands for everything you think is wrong with the world. On the other hand, you have a knight who made one little mistake, but who's devoted to you, saved your life multiple times and wants to truly help you with your cause. Who do you kick out? Do you even have to ask? :)Arya has finally proven herself worthy of getting her own mission. She has to gather intelligence on some guy who gambles with the lives of sea captains. This segment is told very well, with great narration from Arya and a lot of build-up. And it looks like Arya is starting to enjoy becoming an assassin.Cersei finds herself in a hard home of her own, as she's left to rot in the dungeons below Baelor's Sept. The Septa tries to make her confess by depriving her of food and water, and she finds out through Qyburn that help is hard to come by nowadays. Her uncle Kevan won't see her, her son Tommen doesn't want to see anyone, and Jaime is still far away. Seeing Cersei humiliated and helpless is kind of... gratifying, I must say.In the North, an angry Sansa confronts Theon over all his betrayals and asks him how he could do all those things, including murdering her brothers Bran and Rickon. Then Theon finally admits that it wasn't Bran and Rickon whom he killed. It's great to see Sansa finally getting some good news. Maybe that's why she's here in the North... to be reunited with her little brothers at one point.Meanwhile, the Boltons discuss tactics. Roose wants to dig themselves in in Winterfell, but Ramsay has a plan of his own. He wants 20 men to wreak havoc in Stannis's camp. You've gotta hand it to the guy: he really is like the Joker of Westeros. He's completely insane, and he's willing... to do... anything.While Jorah is selling himself back into slavery, Dany and Tyrion talk politics. It looks like they're getting along quite well, and Dany quickly appreciates his pragmatism and understanding of human nature. But she also makes it clear that she has no intention to suck up to this Lord or that Lord. She doesn't only want to stop the political wheel, she wants to break it.Gilly is attending to Sam's wounds from the previous episode, as Olly wants to have a word with him. He obviously has his doubts about the whole \"let's bring the Wildlings to our side of the Wall\" thing, and even starts to question his Lord Commander's judgement. Sam tries to convince him, but Olly is brooding a bit too much to my taste. I'm starting to get a bit worried that he might do something... drastic soon.Jon and Tormund get to Hardhome to meet with the Wildling leaders. They are greeted by the Lord of Bones, who immediately makes it clear that he has no intention of even listening to them. But Tormund is very good at driving the point home, and reduces the Lord of Bones to nothing but bones.Jon has a hard time convincing the Wildlings. Generations of distrust aren't easy to shrug off. But Tormund tells them how he stood up against Stannis and saved Mance from a painful death. That convinces at least a couple of leaders to trust Jon.But the other leaders soon find out what happens if they stay beyond the Wall, as the village is attacked by wights and White Walkers. A spectacular fight breaks out that's both creepy and epic. It shows bravery from both the Night's Watch and the Wildlings, and it introduces us to an awesome new character: the giant Wun Wun.Jon finds himself pitted against a White Walker, as he scrambles to find the dragonglass weapons. Failing to do so, he's forced to fend the attack off with nothing but his own sword. We expect the sword to shatter, as we have seen many other weapons shatter under the White Walker's blows. But amazingly enough, the sword holds, and Jon is able to kill the Walker with a single blow. But wait... I thought only dragonglass was able to harm White Walkers! Is Valyrian steel more powerful than we thought, or is there more to Jon than meets the eye? Does anyone hear the thundering sound of a plot point dropping?After losing hundreds of men, the Night's Watch and Wildlings make a hasty retreat to the ships and to the safety behind the Wall. We end the episode with a truly terrifying image of the Night's King himself, raising the fallen warriors to join his Army of the Death. Their previous fallen comrades are now wights, who will stop at nothing, cannot be negotiated with and only have one purpose: to destroy everything that's still alive.And so ends episode 8 on a very, very high note. This could have easily been an episode 9, but it seems we still have even more to top this. Still, I give this episode 5 stars, because this is exactly the episode I've been waiting for the whole season. I can't wait to see the epic conclusion in episode 9!", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[This review contains spoilers]Easily the best episode of the season so far, it is once again the tale of two halves. The first half of the episode merely serves to move forward the storyline in several arcs:I was rather pleased to see Tyrion's negotiation strategy in action. He sizes up Daenerys, and demonstrates his knack for handling delicate issues, serving up several witty one-liners in the process. Dany, on her part, lets Tyrion know that she intends to rule as an autocrat and not through a coalition, before deigning to let him serve as her Hand.Banished yet again and with a painful death looming large, Jorah makes a desperate bid to reclaim lost honor and glory by enrolling himself in the fighting pits. While the show might serve us some more Gladiator-style visuals of Jorah fighting in the pits only to have him die a hero's death, I really hope they don't. There are far more interesting things happening on the show to let Jorah take up too much screentime in the last two episodes.It was a real relief to see Sophie Turner looking a lot less battered in this episode. Sansa also learns that her younger brothers are still alive, and with Ramsay all set to take some time off from his daily routine of domestic abuse to lead a daring raid on Stannis' camp, this episode gives Sansa more good news than the last few seasons combined.Arya's assassin arc isn't half as interesting as I thought it would be. Nevertheless, she seems to have gained enough of Jaqen's trust to be handed her first target -- an unscrupulous Insurance salesmen. Here too, I hope things pick up pace a bit and that Arya quickly moves back to her primary targets, or whichever few of them are left anyway.Prison doesn't agree with Cersei, and it's sort of sad seeing her in such a pitiable state. I think Qyburn's goodbye \"the work continues\" was some sort of silver lining intended to tell her that Mountain 2.0, on whom Qyburn has been experimenting in secret, is reaching the state that Cersei had in mind. I'm sure this plays some role in the next couple of episodes, but can't yet figure out what.Sam and Gilly have a more-sweet-than-awkward morning after up until they're interrupted by young Olly. It makes sense that Olly hates the wildlings and dislikes Jon for wanting to shelter them, but as Sam seems to have finally convinced him of, they have no other choice. They need every single person they can gather on their side, and even that might not be enough.HardhomeThe Magheramorne Quarry* that was turned into the set for Hardhome looks spectacular, and gives you the chills right from the moment Jon reaches ashore.After making an example out of the Lord of Bones and showing the other Wildling lords that he means business, Tormund leads Jon into a meeting with the elders. There, Jon quickly gives them the speech he's practiced enough by now, and manages to rally most of them to his side. Things seem to be going well. The Wildling lord, played by Danish actor Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen, makes quite an impression but you know something's about to go wrong when she promises her doe-eyed children that she's right behind them. But even the most prescient amongst us non-book-readers couldn't have predicted the source of her ill-fate.The cold winds descend upon Hardhome and the reaction of its inhabitants tells us that they're about to be hit by something more ominous than an avalanche. And boy, do they get hit! Hungry wights charge down upon every human, as Jon, Tormund and the others desperately try to reduce the damage. In a visual illustration of Jon's earlier point about the need for the living to be united, a Thenn who was earlier obstinate in his opposition of the Crows fights by their side to try and disrupt the march of the undead. Just as they seem to holding their own against the wights, the camera pans to a grim shot of some mounted White Walkers overseeing the chaos. After a frenetic fight with one of these Walkers, Jon realizes that he's armed with a weapon far more powerful than he'd imagined. The small victory Jon gains here however offers him little respite as the waves of Wights force all the battle commanders to flee the scene of battle before any more lives are lost. Even the knowledge that his sword kills White Walkers loses its significance when we see the ease with which the Lead(?) White Walker resurrects the newly-dead to further strengthen his army of Wights.The direction of the Hardhome scenes was immaculate. The brilliant soundtrack helps build up the tension and keeps you on edge throughout the battle, and the eerie lack of it amplifies the sense of doom at the end. The last few minutes literally gave me goosebumps.How are we supposed to care about the petty machinations of King's Landing and elsewhere after we just witnessed that? How will anyone stop these White Walkers and their army of Wights? I guess at least for the latter question, we'll have to wait till next season to find out.*This entire glorious set was probably built for just this episode. Viewers who want to get some more details about what went into its conceptualization and creation can watch this documentary released before the start of this season.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u26055 stars is not enough! Give this episode an Oscar, if possible! At least a Golden Globe?What a breath-taking and scintillating episode - the scariest few minutes of GoT ever. Winter has come, truly.The 59:58 long show was music to ears, feast to the eyes and a treat to the yearning mind after a few passive build-ups muddled with errors. Ever heard of a verbattle or button poetry? This one is constructed over dialogues that felt like words ringing through my head as though it was everything, the final move. No more moves and counter-moves. This is it!The Tyrion-Dany and Arya-Jaqen dialogues were beautifully written especially the first. It felt like a reunion of two similar people, one an alter ego of other as they sit and have a discourse on why they should join hands.Arya is ready as well, whether House of Black and White ready ? we don't know. But she is going for her kill and Jaqen seems to carve her future storyline. I cannot refrain from saying this - How pretty she looked in the harbor! It's been a while since I've seen Arya so dressed up. Come to think of it, never! Cersei's misery continues, though she still has hopes in Qyburn. The Septas are doing their bit in making it worse. Big question is when will Cersei break and confess.Reek (Theon)'s inadvertent slip leaves Sansa with the truth that he did not kill Bran and Rickon. This may open a few doors and compel Sansa to take decisions far beyond\u00a0 those of just being a pretty woman in the house. Will Sansa take back Winterfell - another big question with so many ifs and buts!The rest is drowned by fear and nail-biting events that take place when Jon tries to save the Wildlings. This was the second time since reading the first chapter of A Game of Thrones (Benjen Stark and the rangers) did I feel the chill of the Others.\u00a0It was accompanied by the sheer trepidation of the other Others. I wasn't wrong.The power, the number, the strength witnessed first time in scale by the Night's Watch - stunning! I can't wait to see what Jon's next move would be!Can't wait, but the Winter has come!", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I've got to agree with every other review here. This episode was spectacular! I'll get to the best part last.Cersei's comuppance is superbly made. It's not over, obviously. As viewers, we can tell that she's going to be driven to madness soon and her only chance of escape is to confess. She knows it too, but it remains to be seen if she will confess or if Qyburn or Jaime find some way to rescue her. The scene where she licks water off the floor is savagely triumphant. Sansa is not miserable and weak, yay! She's holding her head proud and instead of begging Theon to help her, tells him that she would have done exactly what Ramsay did to him. Good for you, Sansa. Reek -- no, Theon -- no, Reek -- lets slip that Bran and Rickon could still be alive. While this offers a great deal of hope for Sansa and a reason for her to escape, it raises two big questions: 1. If the Boltons find out, will Sansa be affected because there is now a male heir to Winterfell, and most importantly, 2. Reek let slip a little bit of Theon outside when he talked about the two boys. Does this mean Theon could slowly escape out of Reek and maybe even help Sansa escape out of Winterfell?\u00a0 Ramsay, meanwhile, seems to think he can bring Stannis's army down with just twenty men. He has a point when he says that the cold is the Bolton's home but not Stannis's. However, with barely twenty men... I'm curious to see what savagery he is going to be up to. Arya's scenes were perfect! The color, the marketplace, Jaqen, and Arya's first assignment. Faceless Men are contract killers. This man cheats families out of insurance money, and now Arya has been hired to kill him. Her arc is going to get super awesome. Tyrion establishes and reestablishes that he can talk his way out of and into anything. Jorah Mormont seems to be getting desperate to the point of being repulsive, but Dany has now found in Tyrion a well equipped advisor. Their conversations about their respective fathers and families were extremely well written. The best lines always go to Tyrion. Clarke and Dinklage share a pleasant chemistry on screen and look almost natural. I was very surprised at how comfortable Tyrion and Dany seemed. I would have expected Dany to be a little wary of Tyrion in terms of her body language, but the guy has some wits and an equally powerful tongue. I am praying that they never end up in bed, though. Eww. At the Wall, Olly talks to Sam about the wisdom behind Jon's rationale. This scene serves as a stark reminder that though Jon is proved right at Hardhome, back in Castle Black, not everyone agrees with him. Jon now has all of the 5000 odd wildlings on his side, but probably not all of the Brothers. And that's not going to be easy for him at all. At Hardhome... it feels unjust to even describe it. These twenty minutes have to be seen. Jon has a hard time convincing the Magnar of Thenn to come over on his side, but the White Walkers arrive with their wights just in time to prove him right. An interesting and useful reveal is that Valyrian Steel (which is different from dragonglass / obsidian) is also effective against White Walkers. And now the Watch knows it, and that's something the enemy knows.Valyrian Steel comes from the same place as dragonglass, of course: the dragonfires of Valyria. Old Valyria is where Mormont and Tyrion were attacked by the Stone Men. There was one other Valyrian Steel sword we knew of: Ice, belonging to Ned Stark. Obviously, there's a reason why Northeners end up with Valyrian Steel. It was reforged into two blades that were given to Joffrey and Jaime each. Joffrey's is in his coffin and Jaime's is with Brienne now, and that's something to be remembered. Tyrion also has a dagger made of Valyrian Steel. Or he does in the books. My brain is trying to make connections left, right, and center.Will Jon reach out to the rest of the mainland for all the Valyrian Steel they can provide? No one would want to part with it, of course. The metal is legendary. Will Jon be welcomed back a hero at Castle Black? Word of the White Walkers should have reached before he does. Are the Brothers and the Wildlings going to be slitting each others' throats when the wights advance on the Wall? The next couple of episodes are sure to be even more interesting.One more important thing to note is that the Night's King looked at Jon destroying the White Walker. This guy was the one who converted Craster's baby into a ... whatever, from last season. We know that the Night's King was a Lord Commander himself. Book readers should be making some connection here regarding how ADwD ended.\u00a0 Also, this is my new favorite GIF after the one showing Drogon rising. Ice and Fire, y'all.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605(4.5/5)Brilliant episode. I love how the White Walkers and the wights were portrayed.The wights appeared to be more like pawns of the chessboard, while the White Walkers were the more important pieces. While the mindless wights showed all the grace and charm of an octopus on roller skates, the White Walkers were in contrast, quite elegant and impressive. But both, equally terrifying. That's what caught my interest.The background score used in the last scene was absolutely perfect. I loved how the music ended with one of the newly made wights opened their eyes. Really sent a chill down my spine. A perfect way to establish that the long nights are coming. And the dead, with it; as said by Jon Snow.Removing half star for Dany's cheesy dialogue \"I'm going to break the wheel\". Forget the dialogue, Emilia Clarke didn't do it right either.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Summary thoughts:One of the best episodes of TV I've ever watched, alongside the Red Wedding.The fight with the Others was crazy good -- as well-done / scary / awesome as a solid action movie.The action was nicely counterbalanced with the Danerys / Tyrion dialogue, which felt like years in the making and was really fun. Great to see Tyrion conversational and smart again -- as opposed to drunk and helpless.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605In my opinion, it's the best GOT episode so far:1. Cersei finally gets what she deserves.2. The \"terrible children\"s exchanges (this relationship may finally bring some sanity into the show).3. One of the most badass battle ever in a tv show. (from unexpected start to epic stare-down at the end)Also, if you care about metrics, this episode is the highest rated GOT episode on imdb with an insane 9.9/10 (\"Game of Thrones\" Hardhome (TV Episode 2015)) and 100% on rotten tomatoes ( Page on rottentomatoes.com ).", "Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 5 is all set to air on Sunday, the 12th of May at 9 PM ET and 6 PM PT. This will be the penultimate episode in the final season of GoT and is expected to set the stage for a grand finale. The events of the fourth episode of the show have already hyped things up and we await the fifth episode eagerly!Let us take a closer look at the show and all that we expect from it.Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 5 ReviewThe upcoming episode of Game of Thrones will feature all-out action. This will be the episode where Daenerys and Greyworm will avenge the murder of Missandei. We see in the teaser for the episode that Euron is looking at something and his eyes are wide open. We can only assume he is looking at Daenerys riding Drogon attacking his fleet.In this episode, Bran\u2019s vision of a dragon flying over King\u2019s Landing will also come true as it would be Dany storming through the city.What else to Expect from the episode?This episode of the show will also feature Cleganebowl where Sandor Clegane (the hound) will face off with his brother Gregor Clegane (the mountain). This is also likely to be the episode where Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy will meet their end.The real dynamic here would be between Dany and Jon Snow and who would finally rule on the iron throne.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I really enjoyed this episode. Especially the battle at Hardhome. Everything was so well done. You can definitely tell where the budget went for this season. I don't know how the next 2 episodes can compare, especially since they almost always save battle scenes that are this good for the penultimate episodes. This has made up for the previous episodes having little or no action."]}, "49": {"id": "s05e09", "name": "The Dance of Dragons", "script": "A girl will return to the docks.

He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror. And he crouched behind it and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection. But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield. And burnt him to a crisp. Thus ending the dragon-slaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess. Do you like it? He's beautiful. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company? Of course I will. But why am I getting a present? Because you deserve it. My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading. Seemed to me I could make it to the grave. Wish I'd listened to him. This is my own poor way of saying thank you. For teaching me to be a grown-up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I want to hear all about \"The Dance of Dragons\" when I'm back. You'll read it yourself. Prince Doran. Forgive us. We started without you. Please, sit. Princess Myrcella. Uncle. What a lovely dress. - You don't like it? - You must be cold. Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me. Prince Trystane. How's your jaw? A fleabite. What are you doing in Dorne? Looking after the safety of my niece, the Princess Myrcella. And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly, you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force? We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper. That necklace was stolen from my room. Oh, excellent. A last meal before the beheading? Oh, I can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell. No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters. And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital? I'm afraid he does. I cannot disobey my king's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both. If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue, their engagement must stand. I accept. One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the fold. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council. You have my word. The word of a kingslayer. No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine. You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life. Speak to me that way again, and you won't. May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn? Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince? He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished, it's me. Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day. I'll let him decide. I have learned the value of mercy from my father. - I'll set your man free. - You're a good man. On one condition. Why do we play? I'm better than you. I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think I have. I can't recall. You must love humiliation. Or pain. Which do you love most, humiliation or pain? That one hurt, didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister. - You're going to miss. - Oh, I never miss. You will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. What if she's right? - Luck. - Now it's my turn. You're too slow. You've always been too slow. Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk? You'll find out very soon. Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I? The most beautiful woman in the world. And that's the truth. - Slut. Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I didn't realize there were knights of the Blackwater. Only the one. I believe you've already met Prince Trystane. Prince. Sorry about the other day. Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom. I'm glad to hear it. Pie looks good. There was one condition. Perhaps some soup instead. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cock-- How much for your little clam? Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Come on. Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you. Is, uh - Girl! -  Tie her up! Are you deaf? Girl! Girl! My lord. My lord. Lord Tyrell. On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the Free City of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble-free. A bit of chop the last few days. Nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap still guarding the harbor. And how goes the harvest in the Reach? Ah, the vintners say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send a cask of the Arbor's finest your way. I'm afraid I don't partake. Oh. Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course. I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter. Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands. Most unfortunate for the glovers. If a man charges no interest on a loan, then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why chance it? Whereas the promise of reward makes a man willing to gamble. We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell. You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this. We should celebrate. I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do. Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing? - I don't have that gift. - Oh, it's not a gift. It's a skill. Anyone can learn it.  So give me a kiss by the Long Canal   And give me two kisses in Salty Town   For we're going to die tomorrow   The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown  Thought that old shit would never stop singing. Wasn't bad, though. The Tyrells can all rot in hell. Treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king. This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos. - You buying? - Oh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing. Sell your fish somewhere else. Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry. Come here, sweetness. They say oysters get the juices flowing. We'll take half a dozen. Three coppers. Here's a silver because the lady likes you. Too old. Brea. Too old. I have just the one. Anara. Our most expensive girl. But well worth it, I assure you. Too old. Do you have what I want or not? Of course. Of course. These fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry. Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters. - Here. Thank you. - I'll have one. Any vinegar? Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo! Good. I'll tell you when we're done. You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow? Of course. I'll have you whipped, girl. Go, go on. Out, out, go. Valar morghulis. Valar morghulis. And? The thin man wasn't hungry today. Perhaps that is why a man is thin. Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. A girl has work to do. Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die. I believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances. You write like a seven-year-old. Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me. He didn't try to make you pay? Mm-mmm. Maybe he's changed. The queen will be thrilled to know you're bringing her daughter home. She will. You love her very much, don't you? Of course, she's my niece. I wasn't talking about her. You think I disapprove? Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here no one blinked an eye. no one would have blinked an eye at you if you'd been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not. The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want. I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I love. Perhaps even you are innocent of that. Father. Aren't you cold? No. What are you reading? - \"The Dance of Dragons.\" - What's it about? It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered. \"The Dance of Dragons.\" Why is that a dance? It's just what they call it. Hmm, doesn't make much sense. I think it's poetic. If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon who would you have chosen? I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible. Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is no choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it. It's all right, Father. You don't even know what I'm talking about. It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help? Yes, there is. Good. I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And I'm your daughter. Forgive me. Where's my father? I want to see my father. It will all be over soon, Princess. No. Where's my father? No, you can't do this. Father, where are you? Please, let me see my father. Father, where are you? Don't let her do this. Please let go! Let me see my father! Where are you? Please! - It's what the Lord wants. - No. - Please! Let go! No! - It's a good thing. - A great thing. -  Stop. Stop! - Please! - Hear us now, my Lord.  You can't do this!  For you, we offer up this girl Please!  that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.  Please! No, please let me see my father. If we don't act, we'll all starve here. -  All of us. But if we make this sacrifice Accept this token of our faith, my Lord, and lead us from the darkness. - Lord of Light, show us the way. - Mother! Mother, please! Mother, please! Mother! - Mother! - We can't. There's no other way. - She has king's blood. -  Please don't do this! Lord of Light, protect us. Please! Father, please! For the night is dark and full of terrors. Father! Father, don't do this! Please! Mother, no! Please! Please, help! Don't do this! Please, Father! Mother, help! No.  No, please! Don't do this! Don't do this, please, Mother! Please, Mother! Mother, help! Mother, help! Help! Please don't do this, Mother! Please! Please, Mother! Please! Please! No! Please! No! No! Where have you been? Just making sure everything is in order. They're waiting for you. Clap your hands. That one, the smaller man. No question, that's where you should put your money. The smaller man it is. I'm not putting my money anywhere. Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does. People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake. I've spent much of my life in this arena. And in my experience, large men do triumph over smaller men far more often than not. Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You yourself? Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you? Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here. And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy. You don't approve? There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time. Fair enough. Yet it's an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty? It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor. I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness. That is greatness? That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt. My father would have liked you. One day your great city will return to the dirt as well. - At your command? - If need be. And how many people will die to make this happen? If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason. Those men think they're dying for a good reason. Someone else's reason. So your reasons are true and theirs are false? They don't know their own minds, but you do? Well said. You're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles. - Your Grace-- - Shut your mouth. - You can end this. - She cannot. You can. Protect your queen! Go! Your Grace! Your Grace! Come with me. I know a way out. I know a way-- Stay close. This way. The other side. - Follow me. Protect your queen! Drogon! Valahd.", "summary": ["Plot Stannis confronts a troubling decision. Jon returns to The Wall. Mace visits the Iron Bank. Arya encounters someone from her past. Daenerys reluctantly oversees a traditional celebration of athleticism.  Summary At the Wall Jon snow dance of dragons Jon watches wildlings enter inside Castle Black.  Jon Snow, Tormund, and the surviving few thousand wildlings from Hardhome arrive at the Wall, before the gates of Castle Black. For a tense moment Ser Alliser Thorne hesitates to let all of their old enemies through, but finally he gives the order to open the gate. Thousands of wildlings come through the Wall to Castle Black itself, including many women and children, and even the giant Wun Wun. Many men of the Night's Watch glare at them. Alliser coolly tells Jon that he has a good heart (to save so many people), but that it may end up getting them all killed .  Jon reunites with Samwell Tarly, but is despondent, saying that the mission was a disaster and they only managed to save a small fraction of the wildlings at Hardhome. Sam points to different wildlings passing by and notes that each of them would have died if he had done nothing at all, so it wasn't a complete failure.  In the North During the night at Stannis Baratheon's army camp, Melisandre gazes intently into the flames of her tent's brazier hoping to receive visions from the Lord of Light. In the distance, several tents burst into flames, sending confused men shouting, and one horse screams as he runs away on fire. During the night, Ramsay Bolton and twenty men raided the camp, burning much of their food supplies and heavy siege weapons. Hundreds of horses also died in the fire. Davos notes that their situation is now dire: they don't have enough food to make the march back to Castle Black or to advance to Winterfell, and without their siege weapons they have little chance of storming the castle to take its food supplies anyway. Stannis asks how this could happen and Davos insists that the Boltons know the North's terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp. Stannis suggests that the watchmen were either collaborating with the enemy or simply not attentive enough at their posts to allow such a disaster - either way he orders them to be executed. Stannis says to slaughter the dead horses for their meat, which should at least buy them a little time.  Stannis's demeanor becomes grave and half-stunned, as he believes there is only one course of action to take. He starts by ordering Davos to return to Castle Black to ask for more supplies from Jon Snow. Davos is confused given that even if Jon did decide to resupply them the provisions probably wouldn't reach them in time, and wonders why Stannis would send him instead of just a messenger. Stannis insists that it is because he needs his Hand of the King to engage in diplomacy to win Jon over - but in reality, Stannis sends Davos away so he wouldn't be around to stop what Stannis was planning on doing next.  Davos visits the tent of Stannis's daughter Shireen Baratheon to say goodbye. She is enjoying reading a book by Grand Maester Munkun about the Dance of the Dragons, a major civil war in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. They share a laugh about how a knight tried to kill the dragon Vhagar by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield, but it didn't fool the dragon, who promptly roasted the knight. Davos gives her a wooden stag figurine he has been carving as a present. She asks why he has been so nice to her, and he explains that he felt bad that his son Matthos always insisted that his father learn to read and he never did. Matthos died in the war, and by teaching Davos to read Shireen helped him fulfill his son's wish.  Some time after Davos leaves, Stannis himself visits Shireen, visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly. He asks about her reading, and she explains that \"The Dance of the Dragons\" was a great civil war between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon, each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the Iron Throne. The great lords of the Seven Kingdoms each declared for one or the other, dividing the realm in half, and tearing Westeros apart. Brother fought brother and dragon fought dragon in the devastating war. It was a disaster for House Targaryen as well, who never truly recovered. Stannis asks who she would have chosen, Rhaenyra or Aegon, and she says she wouldn't have chosen either - it was all of the choosing sides that plunged Westeros into civil war. Stannis gravely responds that sometimes the world forces a man to choose even if he doesn't want to, but if he stays true to himself he knows what he must do, and then it isn't really a choice at all - even if he hates doing it. Shireen says it's all right and she wants to help him, though he responds that she doesn't even know what he wants. She doesn't care and asks if there is any way she can help, and he says that there is. Shireen insists that she wants to, because she is Princess Shireen of House Baratheon, his daughter. They hug and he embraces her tightly and Stannis whispers \"forgive me\".  Later, Shireen exits her tent as well and sees all of the soldiers gathered around, and asks where her father is. Coming to the front of the assembly, she sees Melisandre in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle. She starts shouting to see her father, but is grabbed by soldiers who drag her to the pyre and tie her to the stake. Melisandre soothingly tries to calm her by saying that it will all be over soon. Shireen's cries ring out through the camp, but no one intervenes. Stannis and Shireen's mother Selyse then appear in the crowd. Shireen sees them and begs her mother and father to help, but they do nothing. Selyse insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the Lord of Light wants.  Stannis dance of dragons Stannis watches as Shireen is sacrificed.  Melisandre begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the Lord of Light, and sets the pyre on fire. As she explained to Stannis before, she believes that sacrificing Shireen's life - which contains the power of a king's blood - will gain the Lord of Light's favor, who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard. Stannis believes that if they do nothing, they will remain snowbound and all starve to death here. Shireen continues to repeatedly cry \"Mother, please!\" and \"Father, please!\" - eventually even Selyse, who only had a cold and non-existent relationship with her daughter, suddenly breaks and rushes forward, begging that they can't go through with it. Soldiers restrain her, however, and she sinks to the ground crying in despair. Shireen's cries become even more frightened, but Stannis continues to watch even as Selyse sobs on the ground. As the flames begin to consume Shireen she wordlessly screams in pain and fear, and eventually even Stannis cannot bear to look anymore as she burns to death.  In Dorne Meeting in dorn jaime myrcella Jaime sits and speaks with Doran.  Jaime Lannister is escorted into the main apartments of the Water Gardens by Areo Hotah, to be received by Prince Doran Martell in a luxurious solar, along with Ellaria Sand, Doran's son Trystane Martell, and Jaime's \"niece\" Myrcella Baratheon. They lounge on a circle of couches, Myrcella cuddling with Trystane. Jaime notes that Myrcella is wearing a revealing Dornish-style dress now, and she says that the warm climate of Dorne agrees with her.  Coming to the point, Doran asks Jaime why he has snuck in to Dorne to abduct Myrcella back to King's Landing. He says he feared for her safety, but when Doran insists why he didn't just send a letter by messenger-raven, he explains that they received a threatening message: Myrcella's Lannister lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper. Doran glares at Ellaria, while a confused Myrcella explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room.  Jaime asks if Doran intends to behead him, but (acting more sympathetic now that Jaime revealed he was threatened first) he says that he will not, because he wishes to avoid war. Doran has seen what war can do, bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in cities at home, and he will not lead his people into that. Ellaria bluntly asks what he will do, break bread with the Lannisters? However he says that is precisely what he will do, as wine is poured for Jaime, and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to King Tommen, First of His Name, long may he reign. Jaime returns the toast but Ellaria deliberately pours out her wine onto the floor in disgust.  Doran asks if Tommen indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital, and Jaime politely says he does, to which Doran says he cannot disobey his king - Myrcella will return to King's Landing. She is upset for a moment, but then Doran explains his solution: his son Trystane will go along with them, to take over the seat on the Small Council which Tywin granted to Oberyn, but which was vacated by his death. Doran insists that for the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne to continue, the engagement of Trystane and Myrcella must stand, and Trystane will simply take his uncle Oberyn's place on the Small Council. Jaime finds Doran's request entirely reasonable, and Myrcella is ecstatic that she will not be separated from Trystane, so Jaime agrees. Ellaria gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that Doran cannot stand, because he has no spine. As she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice, saying that she is the mother of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a long and happy life but if she talks to him that way again, she will not.  Jaime then asks what fate will befall Bronn, who is still imprisoned. Bronn punched out Trystane when they tried to take Myrcella, and Jaime is asked what the normal punishment is for striking a prince where he is from. Jaime politely insists that Bronn was only following orders and they can't punish him for simply following Jaime's commands. Trystane agrees, saying he has learned the value of mercy from his father, but that he has one \"condition\".  In the prison cells, Nymeria and Tyene Sand spar out of boredom, as Obara tries to ignore them and get some sleep. The guards arrive and release Bronn, and Tyene mocks him as he leaves. Areo leads Bronn back to the solar where Doran, Jaime, and the rest remain. Bronn apologizes to Trystane when he sees him and says he didn't mean anything by hitting him before. Jaime then gladly informs Bronn that the Martells agreed to let Bronn go with Jaime, but on one condition: wordlessly, Areo then delivers it by striking Bronn in the face with his elbow, so hard that Bronn is knocked to the floor, as a payback for hitting Trystane.  Later, in the courtyard, Areo brings Ellaria and the Sand Snakes before Prince Doran in his wheelchair. Doran gives Ellaria an ultimatum: she can either choose to swear allegiance to him (and that she will not try something like this again), or she can choose death. Restraining tears, she kneels and kisses his hand. Doran says that he believes in second chances and she is forgiven - but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances.  Ellaria then finds Jaime in a study writing a letter back to King's Landing informing of his return. He writes very poorly, given that he is using his non-dominant left hand, and Ellaria remarks that he writes like a seven year old. Ellaria notes how odd it is that she and Oberyn were looked down on for their sexuality in King's Landing, and Jaime is scorned for his incestuous love for Cersei - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago, if his name were Targaryen, no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship. Cryptically (perhaps spurred by Doran), she then says that she knows \"your daughter\" Myrcella had no part in what befell Oberyn, and maybe even Jaime is innocent of that (and indeed he is, as Oberyn volunteered for the trial by combat). She exits, and Jaime is left to ponder what seems to be her apology.  In Braavos Arya dance of dragons Arya, or \"Lanna\", sells oysters, clams, and cockles on the canal streets.  Arya, in her \"Lanna\" persona, is once again pushing her cart through the canal streets of Braavos selling various types of shellfish. She passes the \"Thin man\" who sells insurance to sailors, having been given a mission by the Faceless Men to assassinate him with poisoned oysters. Just as she reaches him, however, she stops in her tracks and stares fixedly on a boat at the dock which has caught her full attention. Stepping out of the boat is Master of Coin Mace Tyrell - and the commander of his guards is none other than Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard, one of the names on Arya's kill list which she recites as a daily prayer. Meryn helped betray her father and killed her Water Dancing trainer Syrio Forel. Mace was sent by Cersei Lannister to treat with the Iron Bank of Braavos, which has started calling in the crown's massive debts, and at least try to gain a little more time to deal with the problem from the bankers. Mace is greeted at the dock by the bank's representative, Tycho Nestoris. Mace addresses Tycho politely and amiably, though he doesn't realize that his jokes aren't really funny. All the while Arya remains frozen and staring at Ser Meryn, ignoring the Thin Man's requests for some of her oysters.  Arya abandons her mission to assassinate the Thin Man, and instead follows Ser Meryn as he accompanies Mace. After visiting the Iron Bank building, Meryn and a few other Lannister guards depart from Mace at night and go to visit a local brothel. Arya sneaks into the brothel under the guise of simply selling her oysters and clams from a hand basket. The bouncer Brusco doesn't want her in at first but the prostitute Lhara, who is one of Arya's regular customers, tells him to let her stay, as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac. Arya sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on Meryn from behind some shutters. Meryn catches a brief look at her at one point, and she seems vaguely familiar, but he just shrugs it off (it has been years since he last saw her, she is older and thus looks different, she has different Braavosi-style hair and clothes, and he doesn't think that Arya would logically be in Braavos).  The brothel's madam presents several girls in succession to Meryn, but he passes on each as too old. She brings out her best and most expensive prostitute, a beautiful young woman named Anara, but Meryn again dismisses her as too old. The madam slowly realizes that Meryn is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers - around Arya's age - so she brings out a very young girl who Meryn accepts gruffly, bluntly saying he expects another \"fresh\" one tomorrow. After he leaves the madam runs into Arya and shoos her out.  Later, Arya returns to the House of Black and White empty-handed, having abandoned her first mission for the Faceless Men. When Jaqen H'ghar asks what happened, she lies to him and says that the Thin Man simply wasn't hungry today and didn't order any of her oysters. Jaqen quips that perhaps this is why he is a \"thin man\", and Arya promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow. She departs, and while Jaqen seems to suspect that she was lying, he makes no outward reaction to it.  In Meereen Dany in the pits Dany claps to start the fights.  Attended by Tyrion Lannister, Missandei, and Daario Naharis, Daenerys sits in the royal box at the Daznak's Pit. Hizdahr zo Loraq arrives late, claiming to have been putting the final touches on the arrangements for the event. When the first two combatants take the field, Hizdahr indicates that Daenerys is to start the fight with a clap of her hands. Daario verbally spars with Hizdahr for much of the first match, drawing Daenerys's attention from the spectacle in front of her. Her attention returns to the arena when Jorah Mormont gives the traditional dedication to her. In spite of Jorah's previous successes, he has decidedly mixed results in the grand melee he finds himself in. The grand melee begins with six fighters, with Jorah pairing up against a Norvosi long-axe fighter. The Norvosi is able to land several blows against Jorah, eventually knocking him to the ground, however Jorah is able to bring out his dagger and eventually bury it in the Norvosi's chest after a brief melee.  5x09 Missandei Dany Dany and Missandei during the riots.  Meanwhile, a Braavosi Water Dancer easily dispatches his Dothraki opponent, and then focuses his attention on Jorah. Jorah finds himself hopelessly outmatched by the Water Dancer and suffers many cuts from his opponent's rapier. During the fight, a Meerenese Pit Fighter is able to lance his opponent in the chest. The Water Dancer eventually knocks Jorah to the ground, and is about to deliver a killing blow, but fails to notice the pit fighter who kills him from behind. Jorah then battles the pit fighter and kills him and is the last fighter standing.  Jorah stares for a few moments at Daenerys, then suddenly grabs and hurls a spear at the royal box \u2013 embedding itself in a Son of the Harpy sneaking up behind Daario. The Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering collaborating Masters and freedmen alike \u2013 Hizdahr included. Jorah and Daario evacuate Daenerys from the royal box, while Tyrion rescues Missandei. Finding the exits blocked, the group makes a stand in the center of the Pit with remainder of the Unsullied defenders. Seeing they are hopelessly outnumbered, Daenerys takes Missandei's hand and closes her eyes, ready to face her death.  Dany climbs on drogon Dany climbs on, and rides Drogon.  At that moment, a draconic screech pierces the air, and Drogon descends upon the arena, flying out of a giant flame burst.  Many of the Sons scatter in terror as Drogon bites, crushes and mercilessly burns the nearest ones to death. The Sons rally enough to attack Drogon with spears, embedding them in the dragon's tough hide. Daenerys hastily makes an effort to remove the spears, prompting Drogon to turn on her with a huge roar. He stops short of attacking her and becomes calm. Trying to get Drogon out of the Sons' range, Daenerys climbs atop his back and bids him to fly (\"Valahd\"), becoming the first Targaryen dragonrider in over a century. The Sons of the Harpy routed for now, Daario, Jorah, Missandei and Tyrion look on in astonishment as Drogon soars away."], "review": null}, "50": {"id": "s05e10", "name": "Mother's Mercy", "script": "Brace the wind. The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear. We ride for Winterfell. And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right. Your Grace. Prepare to form up. Your Grace. Tell me. The men, many deserted before dawn. How many? Nearly half. All the sellswords with all the horses. Your Grace. Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny. Cut her down. Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp. Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell. He raised his hands and they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall. But the dragonglass No one's ever getting that back now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway. Not unless we had a mountain of it. But you killed a white walker. With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. - But Longclaw - Is Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms? Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? You were friends with me when I first came here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then. Here's to us, then. Long may they sneer. What? I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a maester. That's what I'm meant to be. Not this. I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust? Well, there's Edd. I'd be more use to you as a maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone. The Citadel has the world's greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things, things that will help when-- when they come. If Gilly stays here, then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that. Thank you. You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too. Oh, they'll bloody try. - Sam. - What? Sam. You had just been beaten half to death. How did you-- Oh, very carefully. I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone. I'll come back. To your return. To my return. Aye, this way. My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army. How do you know it's Stannis? They're carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it. Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. - Right, Curlew. - Yes, sir. Dig between those two rises. - Spread out. - I'm with you. - Archers! - Spread out! And send out a foraging party immediately. Siege begins at sunrise. There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace. We've got no chance! No, please, please. Bolton has women fighting for him? I don't fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him with blood magic? I did. In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of His Name, rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words? Go on, do your duty. Looks like we're done here. I surrender! I surrender! And I accept your surrender. Let's head back. My wife must be lonely. My lady. I've come to escort you back to your chamber. Go with her, please. I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's still some of me left. Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die. Your father was Warden of the North. Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir, until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. Then he's got incredible plans for those parts. So, shall we wait for him to come back or should we begin now? You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin. Reek-- stop! Stop! Open the gate! He's coming back. I can see I have my work cut out for me. You two, out. You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many-Faced God stole a few more from me. But I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am? I can't hear you. You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark. Do you know who you are? You're no one. You're nothing. A girl has taken a life. The wrong life. I was right about her. You were. You're not ready. Not at all. That man's life was not yours to take. A girl stole from the Many-Faced God. Now a debt is owed. Only death can pay for life. No! No! No, you-- don't die! Don't die! Why are you crying? He was my friend. No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him? He was no one. But if you're-- who's this? No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall. The faces are for no one. You are still someone. And to someone, the faces are as good as poison. I can't see. What's happening? What's happening?! - I wish you a safe journey home. - Thank you. Forgive me, child. I wish you all the happiness in the world. Maybe I'll come visit you sometime. Maybe I'll come visit you. Don't wait too long. Got a noblewoman to marry back home. You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy. Whenever you're ready, my lord. Try not to lose it this time. I'll never take it off again. I know you didn't want to leave Dorne, but I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. I'm glad Trystane is coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so-- so well arranged. Do you think Mother will like him? If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will. You really believe that? Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children? She likes you. I'm not so sure about that. Listen there's something I wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be, people can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is we don't choose whom we love. It just, well-- it's beyond our control. - I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't. What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying and failing to say-- I know what you're trying to say. No, I'm afraid you don't. I do. I know. About you and Mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I'm glad. I'm glad that you're my father. Myrcella? Myrcella? Myrcella? Myrcella? You love her, don't you? How could you not? Of course it's hopeless for the both of you. A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But we always want the wrong woman. Does he always talk so much? Jorah the Andal. Torgo Nudho. He should not be here. No, but he is. Our queen ordered him exiled from city. Our queen would be dead if not for him. _ _ _ _ _ _ Pu\u00f1ila. Thank you. I am sorry. Sorry I not there to fight for our queen. You missed a good scrap. None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering, the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness. He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go. We? You're a Lannister. The queen intends to remove your family from power. And I intend to help her do it. You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child. - You betrayed her. - Careful now. And she exiled you. Twice, I believe. The second time thanks to you. Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont. He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah. And he's right. Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her. Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep. If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open. Forgive me, but why would we bring you? Pardon me? Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness? Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful. Can you fight? I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior. Are you good on a horse? Middling. So mainly you talk. And drink. I've survived so far. Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have experience governing a city except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen. He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him? They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm. I'll come with you. I'll find our queen. - You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am. He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen. It's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half this city will consume the other half. And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidante, the commander of the Unsullied, and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face. Good fortune, my friends. Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about. Hello, old friend. I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me. I suppose there's no point asking how you found me. The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east, if one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons. Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her and I'm stuck here trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade? Information is the key. You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends. If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies. If only. A grand old city choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast? I did miss you. Oh, I know. We have to go home. Oh, my poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon. Can you take me back to Meereen? How far did you carry me? Drogon, we need to return. My people need me. Well, there's no food. At the very least, you could hunt us some supper. Confess. Confess. I have sinned. I see that now. How can I have been so blind for so long? I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high. And by its holy light-- You wish to make a confession? Once I've confessed, will I be free? Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins. The Mother have mercy, then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess. Name him. Lancel Lannister. Your cousin and the king's squire. - I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband. A husband off whoring every chance he-- His sins do not pardon your own. May the gods forgive me. Other men? No. No others? No. Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime. You understand this? I do. There are those that say your children were not fathered by King Robert, that they are bastards born of incest and adultery. A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the throne, but his brother's children stand in his way. So he claims they are not his brother's. That filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it. Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence. Trial? I have confessed. To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods. I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son-- I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him, please. You have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep. Thank you. Thank you. The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank. I will. I will. I swear it, day and night. Good. Am I free to go? After your atonement. My atonement? A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister. Mother to His Grace King Tommen. Widow of His Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her to you, the good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart, shorn of secrets, naked before the eyes of gods and men to make her walk of atonement. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame.

He has sworn that he will not speak until all His Grace's enemies are dead and evil has been driven from the realm. Who came to your aid? Stannis. Now he needs you. We don't have enough men to make any difference. The wildlings will make a difference. The wildlings will never fight for Stannis. - I told him before. - You saved their bloody lives. If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our Wall, they ought to fight for the damn place. - It's not their fight. - Open the gates! Stannis? Shireen? The princess? Lord Commander. It's one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he's still alive. Are you sure he's talking about Benjen? Said he was First Ranger. Said he knows where to find him. Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome at the last full moon. - Could be lying. - Could be. There are ways to find out. - Where is he? - Over there. For the Watch. For the Watch. For the Watch. For the Watch. For the Watch. Olly For the Watch.", "summary": ["Plot Stannis marches. Daenerys is surrounded by strangers. Cersei seeks forgiveness. Jon is challenged.  Summary In the North As the snow begins to melt, Melisandre is elated. Still grieving, Stannis prepares to march on Winterfell. However, one of his generals informs him that nearly half of his men have deserted - mainly the sellswords, who have also run away with all their horses. Another soldier comes with more bad news: Selyse has hanged herself out of grief for her daughter. As he views her body, his general reports that Melisandre has fled.  5x10 Battle of Winterfell Battle of Winterfell.  Marching across the fields with less than half the men he once had, Stannis has his men start preparing for the siege but is instead met in combat early by the Bolton army. The mounted Bolton army easily defeats Stannis's tired and mountless army. Wounded and exhausted, Stannis fights off two remaining soldiers in the aftermath of the carnage and collapses against a tree.  Brienne of Tarth was warned by Podrick Payne of Stannis's arrival and leaves her watch for Sansa's signal. After the battle, she waits and finds a wounded Stannis. She declares who she is and that her king was killed by his brother's shadow that bore his face, before drawing her sword to slay him. Stannis, having lost everything, simply accepts his fate to die: he tells Brienne to do her \"duty\". After a moment's hesitation, Brienne swings her sword at him. Elsewhere, Ramsay finishes off the few remaining Baratheon soldiers and heads back to Winterfell.  Theon-and-Sansa-S05E10 Theon and Sansa prepare to jump.  In Winterfell itself, Sansa uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room, and seeks out the tower to light her signal. After the candle is lit, she sees the Boltons clash with Stannis's army and sees this as a time to slip out of Winterfell. Desperately running across the ramparts, she is stopped by Myranda and Reek. Myranda threatens Sansa with a bow but Sansa, weary and realizing she can't escape a shot from a bow, tells her to kill her while there is still a part of the real her left. Myranda tells Sansa that Ramsay needs her to have an heir and for nothing more afterward - but says Ramsay does not need all of Sansa in one piece to accomplish that. Sansa braces herself for the worst as Myranda tenses her bow. However, Theon finally breaks the Boltons' hold on him and causes Myranda to misfire. He grabs and hurls Myranda over the ramparts and Myranda screams as she hurtles to her death, being killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below. Sansa and Theon run, but with Ramsay just returning from the battle, they find themselves with nowhere to go. Hoping to land in deep snow and survive the long fall, the two of them grasp their hands together and jump off the rampart.  In Braavos Arya-kills-Trant-S05E10 Arya kills Meryn Trant  Ser Meryn Trant is looking upon three young girls in the Braavosi brothel. Of the three girls, two begin to cry and scream when they are whipped by Meryn, however the last girl has no reaction when whipped. Meryn sends the two weak girls away, and punches the last in the stomach. However, the last girl is revealed to be Arya Stark, after removing her fake face. She pulls out a knife and stabs Meryn in both eyes and chest repeatedly, and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries. She then reveals her identity and reminds Meryn of how he killed her dance master, Syrio Forel, before calling him 'no one' and slitting his throat.  Arya then returns to the House of Black and White and returns the face that she used to hide her identity. However, Jaqen H'ghar and the Waif appear and say that Meryn's life was not hers to take, and that a debt must be paid. The Waif grabs Arya as Jaqen pulls out a vial, presumably containing some kind of poison. However, he drinks the poison himself and collapses, with Arya screaming for him to stay alive. Arya states that he was her friend, and hears Jaqen's voice behind her say 'he was no one'. She turns around to see that the Waif now has Jaqen's face. Arya asks who the person on the floor with Jaqen's face is. Jaqen, in the Waif's body, says that he is no one. Arya begins to remove multiple faces from the person on the floor, until she sees her own face. She then begins to lose her sight as her eyes turn white and screams for help.  In Meereen With Daenerys gone, her council is unsure of how they should continue. Tyrion addresses both Jorah and Daario's feelings for her, understanding all too well how one could love the wrong woman. The three argue about Jorah's betrayal, but they will not make any judgments without Daenerys first. Drogon was seen taking her north and that is where they need to search for their queen. Grey Worm, still recovering from his injuries, offers to go with Jorah and Daario, as does Tyrion. Daario firmly nixes both ideas. Grey Worm is needed to command the Unsullied in keeping the city under control, while Tyrion is the only one of them to have any actual political experience. Daario expresses confidence that with Missandei's help, the pair of them should be able to keep Meereen under control until they return with Daenerys.  As Tyrion watches Daario and Jorah depart the city, Varys calmly walks up to Tyrion. Teasing Tyrion about abandoning him in Volantis, he is pleased to see Tyrion already settling into a role that suits him. He reminds Tyrion that he has experience running a city full of people trying to kill each other, and implies that he and his little birds are there to help.  In the Dothraki Sea Daenerys-capture-dothraki A khalasar surrounds Daenerys.  Meanwhile, Daenerys finds herself far away from Meereen, atop an impressive hill in a sea of green grass. Drogon is still recovering from the wounds he received from the arena in Meereen and is uninterested in flying back. Unfortunately, he's also not interested in finding them any food. Daenerys wanders away to find something for them, but is startled to see a trio of Dothraki bloodriders emerge. Within minutes, an entire khalasar has her surrounded. Understanding what might happen to her, she quickly removes a ring and drops it in the grass, determined to leave a trail. In Dorne Myrcella-ellaria-kiss Ellaria kisses Myrcella goodbye  Jaime, Bronn, Myrcella, and Trystane say their farewells to the Martells to return to King's Landing. Upon saying goodbye, Ellaria Sand kisses Myrcella on the lips, while Tyene Sand flirts with Bronn. Aboard the ship, Myrcella and Jaime talk about Cersei. Jaime begins to come clean to Myrcella, awkwardly telling her that we cannot choose who we love. Myrcella then reveals that she knows that Jaime is her real father, and that she is glad that he is, and the two embrace. However, Myrcella's expression changes, the smile fades on her face and her nose starts to bleed. She collapses in Jaime's arms. Back in Dorne, Ellaria wipes the blood from her nose and takes the antidote for the poison coated on her lips.  In King's Landing Cersei&#039;s-WalkofShame-S05E10 Cersei prepares for her penance.  Septa Unella enters Cersei's cell and orders her to confess. Finally giving in, Cersei is brought before the High Sparrow to confess her sins. She confesses her adultery with Ser Lancel, but denies her incestuous relationship with her brother Jaime. Cersei begs to be allowed to go to the Red Keep to see her son Tommen. The High Sparrow grants her request but says that there will still be a trial to ascertain the truth behind the other charges that she still denies: incest and regicide. Cersei is brought to a cell where she is stripped naked and roughly washed before her hair is quickly cut short. She is brought outside where she is required to walk naked through the streets of King's Landing from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep as punishment. She is accompanied by Septa Unella, who repeats the word \"shame\" three times and rings a bell every few steps, and six members of the Faith Militant. Cersei performs her walk of atonement amidst the leering crowds who immediately begin pelting her with filth and vicious insults, such as \"cunt\" and \"brother-fucker\". With bloody feet, Cersei eventually makes it to the Red Keep and bursts into tears. Upon entering the gates, Cersei finds her uncle Kevan Lannister, Grand Maester Pycelle and Qyburn waiting for her. Qyburn attempts to comfort her by covering her body with a cloak. Heavy footsteps are heard, and Qyburn introduces Cersei to the newest member of the Kingsguard: an 8 foot tall man in golden armor, who he says has sworn a vow of silence until all their foes are defeated. Qyburn suggests Cersei go inside where he can attend to her feet, which are badly injured, and the huge knight lifts her up and carries her away, as her expression already begins to harden. At The Wall Jon Snow tells Sam what he witnessed at Hardhome. He hopes the White Walkers can't climb the Wall as there is not enough dragonglass or Valyrian steel in Westeros to combat them. Sam asks Jon if he can travel to Oldtown to study and replace Aemon as the new Maester of the Watch. He feels there is no other way he can help them as he cannot fight. He is also afraid for Gilly and her child's safety, and wishes to take them along. Jon reminds him that the the Citadel will also not allow Sam to be with women, but is humored to hear that it is already too late for that. Sam promises he will return, they toast to that and Jon sees his only friend off.  Davos, having returned to Castle Black at Stannis's orders, urges Jon to convince the Wildlings for aid. Jon refuses him, saying that they wouldn't side with Stannis and this is not their fight. Both of them are shocked to see a speechless and despondent Melisandre return to the Wall. Ser Davos pressures Melisandre for news, specifically asking after Shireen, but Melisandre remains silent. After seeing the empty look in her eyes, Davos lets her leave.  Olly-stabbing-jon Olly deals the final blow to the Lord Commander.  That night, Jon is reading messages when his steward Olly tells him that a wildling knows of the whereabouts of his long-missing uncle. Jon Snow quickly rushes with Thorne to a gathered group of Watchmen, only to see a placard with the word \"traitor\" written on it. He turns around to find his Brothers staring him down. Thorne makes the first move and stabs the Lord Commander. \"For the Watch\" Thorne says, as well as the others as they close in and continue stabbing him. One after another, Jon Snow is betrayed, \"For the Watch.\" Finally, a tearful Olly approaches last. After a moment of pause, Jon gasps, \"Olly,\" before Olly delivers the final blow, repeating the pledge. The brothers leave Jon to die alone in the snow."], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605It was underwhelming with at least ten plot holes, but it wasn't bad at all! I watched the whole thing at 2x speed, and managed to understand exactly what the show creators are going for. I do have a lot of complaints that I will weave into this post. On the positive side, this episode has left us with the most\u00a0 cliffhangers ever. Is Myrcella dead? Is Stannis dead? Are Sansa and\u00a0 Theon dead? IS JON SNOW DEAD? I thought for a moment that it was\u00a0 probably over done, but I surprisingly liked all the suspense. It was an\u00a0 apt way to close the season: suspense for both the readers and the\u00a0 viewers. First and foremost, hats off to Lena Headey! The walk of atonement was beautifully made. Although they filmed with a body double and barely five people on set, the entire walk was believable, real, and traumatic. Headey's expressions were superb. But I felt, that both Stephen Dillane (Stannis) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) had dropped some points with their acting. All of the scenes involving the two of them felt forced and over rehearsed (or under rehearsed, I don't know). But back to KL, how is Cersei not being charged with the murder of Robert? That was the main reason why she was arrested, wasn't it? Lancel talks of their relationship AND the wine he was made to feed Robert. I guess she's going to have a trial where that comes up. And considering her new aide, we can be sure there's another demand for trial by combat in the next season. Although I have no idea how such a large cavalry could be accomodated inside of Winterfell, Stannis made a huge stupid move to lay seige. Of course he wasn't going to win. What was he thinking? But I have a big BIG complaint about the Battle at Winterfell. WHERE WAS THE BATTLE? They had been building up to this the whole season! And they didn't as much show as a clash of swords! There was a lot of noise while Boltons pounce on Stannis, and suddenly Stannis is barely able to walk. It's outrageous. Even stranger was Stannis subjecting himself to Brienne like that. It was very out of character for him. It was a triumphant moment for Brienne, but it was hardly believable because it came and went so quick before it could even register. And Melisandre just rode back to Castle Black? That's akin to deserting her king and very out of character for her, even if she suddenly did stop believing in Stannis. I'm very glad to see Theon finally break free of Reek. Sure, in their desperation, they jumped down a fifty feet wall, but I'm hoping Sansa and Theon are alive next season. Also, did anyone notice that Sansa is now a nearly spitting image of Catelyn Stark? The other Stark girl was awesome, as usual. The gory, bloody butchering was a treat to the mind. However, I have two very specific problems with the Arya story. One, why was Meryn Trant made out to be such a disgusting child abuser/rapist/whatever? I hate the fact that D&D take the villians to such caricatures when they want us to side with the \"good ones\": be it Arya or Tyrion or Dany, the bad guys are so evil and bad in such a larger than life way, you can't help but think these three are heroes and saviors. I hate that. They aren't. All three of them are cold hearted and Arya is a cold hearted killer, and it should be shown that way. This is not a good triumphs over evil story. Arya hated him for killing Syrio Forel and that should be enough. Two, how did she learn how to use the faces? More importantly, how did she see her own face and Jaqen's? Ok, granted maybe Jaqen's face belonged to someone who is dead and is simply used by this guy, how can Arya's face be on the body? The faces are physically cut off dead people. That's why Arya spent so much time cleaning bodies. Was it magic? If yes, was it magic that caused her to go blind? In the books, she drinks a potion that causes blindness, but it wasn't so here. They can do magic now and cast illusions at the House of Black and White? Gah. Dany is found by a khalasar. She is flown all the way to the Dothraki sea and found by people who probably already know her. But man, was that scene long! Even at 2x speed, the men whirring around Dany kept going on and on and on. I suppose that was for the viewers' benefit -- to remember the Dothraki and how violent they are and how Dany could be in trouble now. So.. Tyrion and Grey Worm and Missandei are going to be taking care of Mereen's administration now. That made me snort. We've heard over and over again how Westeros is NOT like Essos, so I don't see how Tyrion can help. We know that Dany, being a woman, is powerful only because of her dragons. So I don't know how Missandei is going to help. We also know that the Unsullied are subservient fighters who are taught to fight or die. They are not trained in administration or ruling whatsoever. Plus, Grey Worm is castrated and the common folk aren't going to respect that. So I don't know GW is going to help. Worst of all, none of these three can even dream of going near the dragons and the common folk know that very well. Bad decision. Desperate decision, maybe, but bad decision nevertheless. Oh and the Missandei/Grey Worm subplot really irks me too. There's no point to it. It looks like the two will end up dying together some time in the future. Dorne. I've hated Dorne since the season began. A Sand Snake -- a terrifying deadly killer of a woman -- is whispering dirty words into Bronn's ears. Dafuq. As if last week's slapping game wasn't enough. Oh, and what was the point of killing Myrcella after Trystane got a seat on the Small Council?? Jaime then talks about how you can't choose who you fall in love with. Ugh. Really? Nothing that happened in Dorne made any sense. Absolutely nothing. Sure, Ellaria Sand wanted revenge, but surely she isn't so foolish that she doesn't realize that Jaime can just turn the ship around and accuse her? And then she would get thrown into jail with her daughters and there will be a full blown war. It makes no sense. However, it gave us yet another cliff hanger. Is Myrcella dead? Finally, Jon Snow. I liked this scene. I know there was no buildup to it, and there wasn't even a valid enough reason (umm hello, White Walkers are coming and everyone knows that!), but it was made well. It was unexpected and painful. But where is Ghost?Lastly, what's with the title of the episode? Was that a deliberate way to troll readers about LSH? Is there even going to be LSH? This season felt like a forced list of shocking moments that D&D checked off their list, and forcefully built the story around. Half the plots in this season made no sense, but I still liked this episode because each of those mini cliff hangers were evocative of the Red Wedding. And this season has ended on the same note for both the book readers and the viewers.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605The season 5 finale of Game of Thrones is unlike anything we've seen before, riding on the coattails of two previously top-notch episodes and creating a suspenseful, emotional roller coaster throughout all 60 minutes. Although I wouldn't say it was the most coherent episode and left many questions unanswered, the condensation of world-changing events in this single episode infest viewers with sheer bewilderment--a novel element long lost to genre-conforming television.SPOILERS AHEAD: PROCEED WITH CAUTION.WinterfellThe futility of Stannis' mission to conquer the North finally hits home with Queen Selyse's death, placing the viewer right alongside Stannis' torn psyche. Brienne's direct conflict with Stannis at his last breath interestingly parallels the two most persistently stubborn characters of the show. It not only offers the values they fight for but cuts at the vital moment--begging the question: Is Stannis really dead?Theon is back baby! I was in tears watching Theon peel away the disgusting skin of Reek away to rescue Sansa in her most desperate time. I was reminded of Theon's camaraderie to the Starks, even if he was at heart a Greyjoy. Again, the creators cut at the vital moment (damn you, stop teasing me) to offer the possibility that Sansa and Theon make it out alive.BraavosThere is nothing more satisfying (and disgusting to know that you are satisfied by it) than to revel at the death of someone you hate on screen. Yet I did. Arya Stark so coldly killed the sadist pedophile Meryn Trant that I almost cried tears of joy.However, her punishment reminds us that the God of Death has rules that need to be followed, alluding to Arya's inevitable extended training period to prove herself as.... no one.DorneAlthough Cersei may be repulsive to viewers, Jaime Lannister has redeemed himself past his sister-fucking reputation to be known as a noble hero in his own right. That's why his candid discussion with his daughter Myrcella about their connection felt as heartwarming as it was strange. In any character's arc, it is these small moments that make us understand and sympathize with characters even further. I have to applaud the consistency of the show for this.And yet... Vipers don't die quietly. As sad as I felt for the death of an innocent girl, I felt happy that revenge was done right on account of my dear favorite Oberyn Martell (RIP). Damn you, Game of Thrones, for making me take sides!MeereenI am ecstatic to see how Tyrion roars at the politics of a city in Essos, as he so brilliantly did in Westeros at King's Landing (Season 2). I am made even more excited with the return of Varys, the clever \"Master of Whisperers\". It is a crucial, politically-driven season in the making and I cannot wait.Somewhere in the middle of nowhereReally? You're going to end on a cliffhanger for Daenerys too? Oh well, on we ride.King's LandingCersei's walk of shame was perhaps the most uncomfortable scene I've ever witnessed on television... in this season. Director David Nutter (who directed Season 3 Episode 9 by the way) does a phenomenal job of making us feel sorry for the most hated character in Game of Thrones.Not to fear though, it ends with the much anticipated ZOMBIE MOUNTAIN, who carries her out, into redemption? Or another scheme? If the burning questions in my body all consolidated, I fear I may spontaneously combust faster than Lady Melisandre's victims! Too soon? Sorry.Castle BlackNo words. The use of Olly's character to add flame to the fire with that final stab was such an unexpected yet well placed turn that leaves me pining for the return of my sanity.And now his watch is ended?We'll have to wait 10 months to find out.", "\u2605\u2605An okay-ish end to a terrible season.Tread carefully, there be spoilers ahead (from the books too)!Despite all the hype surrounding the episode that it was supposed to \"break the internet\", what we saw tonight hardly even made a dent. While the finale does manage to neatly tie-off all the story arcs that were explored this season, it was nonetheless not even close to being as impactful as the others.1. (I've ranted enough in last episode's review about how D&D have never understood Stannis and/or his motivations and that they've presented their own biased views of him to show-only audiences, so I'm not going to harp on that again.)As a continuation of the last episode we see that the Shireen-bonfire party did have the intended effect - the snows-are-a-thawing; but now half of Stannis' men have deserted him. Who would have thought that might happen? It's not like Stannis was the best military commander in the Seven Kingdoms. Oh, wait.Expanding on that,Random Soldier: Your Grace, we're nearing Winterfell, wouldn't it be wise to send scouts ahead? Are you sure? Well, okay then.And to top it off, we have an infuriatingly nonexistent take on what happens next. The last we see of Stannis, he is exposed right at the front of his vanguard with the Bolton Army about five times his numbers charging against him (on horseback, mind you - while Stannis has none), flanking both sides while a third of his army is deserting from the rear. And he not only survives R'hllor knows how many charges, but lives long enough to kill two more of Ramsay's leftover men while being severely injured just so that Brienne could finish him off? That's a paddlin'.Meanwhile elsewhere Ramsay's killing off stragglers just for shits and giggles. And speaking of Ramsay, I'm getting tired of the \"untouchable bad guy\" thing they've got going on for him. And now that he's lost Myranda, Reek/Theon and Sansa in one sweep, his reaction would have been something to look forward to if only there had been someone (Stannis) to take advantage of his rashness in a military strategy.2. In Braavos, we finally see what Meryn-too-old-Trant does with his little pre-teen tea party guests. Despite hating the show-only extra incentive to wanting him dead, I actually loved t(his) execution. The killing was reminiscent of the Tickler's multiple stabbing (AFfC), Oberyn's gouged eyes and Catelyn's throat swipe, and it achieved the intended effect of vengeance served on a cold platter. And while Arya's arc has deviated the least from the books, the merging of Raff the Sweetling and Dareon into Trant helped segueing the story back to where it was supposed to be and that's a plus for the show.3. Cersei's Walk of Atonement was hard to watch. I never thought I'd feel pity for her but I have to admit - I did. And what with the entry of Ser Robert Strong and the casting news looking for a character matching the description of a certain Septon next season, I'm all aboard the hype train for Cleganebowl 2016!5. At Dorne, apart from the awfully cringeworthy \"bad pussy\" line from Tyene, we have a truly heart-warming father-daughter moment between Jaime and Myrcella. But of course such trifles do not last long, doubly so in Game of Thrones. On the bright side Ellaria does stay true to what Oberyn said back in the last Season:We do not harm little girls in Dorne.and to what Doran warned her about back in the second episodeWe do not mutilate little girls, not here.Technically, the poison took effect on International Waters, so Ellaria and the Sand Snakes have got that going for them; although by doing so, not only have they enraged the Crown (when word of this reaches King's Landing) but they've also handed over a hostage in the form of Trystane who is also Doran's heir, so I don't exactly know what Ellaria was thinking, if at all.6. The Meereen arc would have been next to useless with all the petty squabbling if not for the reentry of Varys back into the picture. It will be interesting to see how Tyrion and his old comrade handle the upcoming civil war now that Daenerys isn't there any longer to add wildfire to the dragonflame.7. At the Wall, I'm glad they're following Sam's journey to Oldtown. Although in this case, I don't exactly know how I feel about Sam himself suggesting the idea - does it show a better, less-craven Sam? Doesn't this go against what little we heard of Randyll Tarly earlier this season? I'm conflicted about this, but glad they're not skipping that whole arc.8. For the Watch!: This was it - the reason why book readers were eager to watch the episode - if not just to put some theories to rest. I'll admit - using the Benjen bait and switch for roping us book-readers in was a clever (read cheap) piece of advertising. I immediately felt stupid when I realized what was going to happen when Olly came up to Jon with news about his uncle. And as far as the actual \"For the Watch\" is concerned, while it was perfectly in line with what happens in the books, I think they went overboard turning it into some kind of a ceremony what with making a sign-board marked \"Traitor\" and all that just for this one occasion while they should be worrying about getting hold of Valyrian swords to fight an army of the undead at their doorstep.Overall, this season has been the weakest link in the series so far. All this, when D&D had the source material ready at hand to refer to. I can only imagine what they're going to do from here on. The way things are going, I'm no longer worried about the show spoiling the books for me.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605A Weak Season Finale.The most important highlight of this season to me was deviation from the books and plot conveniences - this episode succinctly describes this point. Another highlight has been degradation of the elements that made us feel how real this world of fantasy was.Quickly going over the plots that have ended on a cliffhanger/left us wondering:Dany is surrounded by a Khalasaar - although we don't know if they know who she is. Also, boy does the Dothraki sea look different from what we saw in the first season! For once, I thought Dany landed in Westeros - probably the place where they filmed Brienne and Hound's fight.Theon and Sansa are literally left halfway on their jump - what was their motivation apart from breaking all the bones? It looks Sansa had a plan to escape but was Theon an accomplice all along? Not much is revealed here.Arya is blinded. To be honest, Meryn Trant's assassination was seriously some PG stuff, reminded me of Oberyn's death scene. That girl is way too vengeful.Cersei's walk of shame was pretty much satisfying. However now, the gold cloak have Ser Robert Strong on their side (since he's risen from dead you can't kill it, unless in this case, you chop its head off). When will the trial take place we can only anticipate. Also, we see\u00a0 the gradual fulfilment of Magi the witch's prophecy - Myrcella dies from a kiss of death.Jon is stabbed, but did he warg? Did he or did he not?\u00a0 [Please stop circulating fake images on the web.]There were other small plots: Jorah and Daario set off on an expedition to find Dany, while Varys reaches Mereen to find himself assisting Tyrion - the only two characters whose conversations sound interesting to listen.And now, the one big plot that has ended: Stannis' claim to the Iron throne and the Battle for Winterfell is over - what an anticlimax! Stannis didn't even stand a chance. It was only logical that the Sellswords deserted after Shireen's sacrifice\u00a0 but I seriously don't believe they took away all the horses - not a single horse in his army left? And how is it that Stannis, one of the best generals of Westeros, has no fucking idea what's going on with his troops?\u00a0 This is what happens when you first deviate from the books but inevitably return back to tie the loose ends. This undoubtedly gets the award for 'the most unsatisfactory end to a plotline ever'.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Well, Episode 10 was a worthy finale that brought the developments of the entire season to the proper conclusions. After the shock of Episode 9, Episode 10 was nothing but satisfaction to me. Let's break it down again.People who were outraged by Stannis' decision in last episode will probably rejoice at the start of this one. Stannis is having the worst day ever as everything around him turns to absolute shit. He loses half of his men, his wife and his spiritual guide in a span of 5 minutes. In the end, he does recognize that forward is still the only way to go, so he still decides to march on to Winterfell and take on the Boltons.Jon is having a heartfelt talk with his buddy Sam, because he has to share his experiences at Hardhome with someone. Sam asks him why he doesn't tell the other Brothers what happened. Yeah, Jon, why don't you? They might be a little more understanding about it if they'd know how big a threat the White Walkers really are. Oh well, it's probably one of those \"you had to be there\" stories.Also, Sam asks Jon for permission to leave for Oldtown to become a maester, because he feels he can be of more use in that capacity. Let's hope we can see more of him next season, because Oldtown seems like a very interesting place.Meanwhile, Sansa decides it's finally time to call in the cavalry, and she lights a candle in the Broken Tower. But in Stark fashion she's just one moment too late, because Brienne has already received the news of Stannis' arrival at Winterfell. She decides avenging her beloved Renly is worth more than the oath that brought her there. So she turns away 10 seconds before the window is lit.The battle between Stannis and the Boltons is shorter than he thought. The Boltons decide that it isn't even worth to have Stannis besiege them. They just ride out and decimate his army. Stannis manages to fight off some soldiers, but then succumbs to his wounds just as Brienne finds him. He confesses his sins to her and she sentences him to die. And ironically, she uses Oathkeeper to execute him, just after she broke her oath to Sansa to get to Stannis.Fortunately for Sansa, she finds an unlikely hero in Theon. He kills Miranda for her and then helps her escape from Winterfell. Finally some redemption in his arc! And Alfie Allen is Awesome As Always :).Arya decides to go forward on her mission. Posing as a young brothel girl, she manages to finish Ser Meryn Trant in a rather gruesome way.But she finds out that there's a price to pay for deciding for yourself who lives and who dies. A disappointed Jaqen explains to her that the faces in the House of Black and White are meant for people who are truly no one. They are poison for people who don't understand them completely. And with that, Arya loses her eyesight completely.Speaking of poison... the altered \"Dornish Master Plan\" turns out to be not so good for Myrcella Baratheon. Ellaria Sand gives her a final kiss before she departs Dorne with her dad... but it turns out it was a poisonous kiss. And just as Jaime was finally looking forward to being a real dad, he's got a dead daughter at his feet. Yeah, great job at protecting her, Jaime!In Meereen, Daenerys' small council decides what to do now that she took off with her dragon. Jorah and Daario are definitely riding out to look for her, and Tyrion wants to come, too. But after a nice \"what are YOU good for?\" talk, they decide that Tyrion should rule the city with Missandei and Grey Worm.While this may be a bit of a bummer for Tyrion, it's actually not so bad when he sees an old friend again. Tyrion and Varys, deciding the fate of Meereen. Now that's going to be interesting in season 6!Drogon brought Daenerys back to the north of the Dothraki sea. But she can't get him to bring her back to Meereen, as he's acting like a big baby. Their scenes together are very well done CGI-wise, I must say. Much better than the fighting pit scenes in last episode. She interacts with Drogon very naturally, but that's actually very hard to accomplish with CGI.After her argument with the dragon, she sets out to look for food. But after only taking a few steps, she gets surrounded by a Dothraki khalasar. Well, always nice to see some familiar faces... right?Cersei reaches her low point after she's forced to confess her adultery with Lancel. She's stripped naked and forced to take a Walk of Attonement. For me, the most uncomfortable part in this scene wasn't the walk itself, but the part where they cut her hair. Cersei always had beautiful, long hair. Cutting it off really symbolizes how her power and dignity were cut off from her.But new hope arrives for her in the form of the latest addition to the King's Guard: Ser Robert Strong, a.k.a. Ser FrankenMountain. That's always handy in case she'd ever need someone, like... be her champion in a Trial by Combat or something? :)Melissandre makes it back to the Wall and is greeted by a worried Davos. It's too bad that the showrunners don't really take time to show his reaction to what happened to Shireen. The question what Davos makes of everything that has happened is still unanswered. So his character will probably become way more interesting next season.Finally, we see Jon being set up for his downfall. And kudos to the person who asked if Uncle Benjen Stark would still make an appearance this episode. It was clear that Olly would be a part of the betrayal, but I'm actually glad that the Night's Watch did it as a group effort. I want to take a moment to applaud young Brennock O'Connor for his portrayal of conflicted Olly in season 4 and 5. He lost everything in season 4, found something to believe in this season, and then lost everything again when the man he put all his trust in sides with the people who murdered his whole family. \"Et tu, Olly?\" \"Yeah, sorry. You know nothing, Jon Snow.\"And so the episode ends with an image of a very dead Jon Snow. He's not warging, he's not rising from the grave... he too, is a dead Stark now. The real question is: could Melissandre do anything about that? And if she does, will that finally release Jon from the Night's Watch to become an active player in the Game of Thrones? Or will he be risen by the Others to become a commander in their army? We don't know, but I'm pretty sure his part hasn't ended yet.ConclusionEpisode 10 is a great way to end a season with very high and very low points. The Dorne-storyline was a huge disappointment and the way Stannis met his downfall was despised by many. But the political changes in King's Landing were very interesting, Tyrion's storyline in Essos is promising and Hardhome was unbelievably good. Overall, I'm glad I watched this season and I'm looking forward to next year, where the story will probably continue on his own without help from the books. Until then: valar morghulis! :)", "\u2605\u2605A pretty mediocre end at a below average season.First of all I will start with Danny ,she is making real progress , increasing her leadership skills but she is in a galaxy far far away...how far? Who knows ? Depends on how many books they want to write. Now she is taken even further somehow ( though she drops a ring so they will find her...hell even with cellphones I could not find anyone but they will find a ring in a field). The rest of her team are magically alive and have to deal with ISIS . BTW how come the greatest soldiers getting killed by people with knives or why they are STILL using spears in narrow alleys beats me.Stannis stannis stannis....well he is the most accomplished military commander between all the throne suitors...wait has he won a battle or even made a rational decision ever?He killed his daughter and expected his army to fight for him? Does not matter anyways,probably Bolton could have killed everyone single handedly, he even sabotaged a military camp because \"northerns know the terrain better\" ,probably used the vents to get through or the sewer system oh wait there was not any.Btw he have been killed.Cersei , I hated her from episode one but for six minutes I had to see her walking around because\u00a0 Isis\u00a0 wanted her to.Hey I can see a pattern...Back in Joffreys day he would imprison them,have let them resort to cannibalism, see who survived and take them champion in order to draw a blood eagle on his back but hey they have become powerful because Marx -srry I meant high sparrow is righteous. Oh we also have clegane as a zombie.Myrcella -cute- Lannister gets murdered ,maybe...maybe not ...who cares boring arch...Arya gets revenge on the shiny armor guy ,who just like to torture young girls, using the holy grace...or magic...which learns to use because of washing corpses...obviously. I enjoyed the gore of this scene i have to say. Sansa stark decides to jump from the highest place she can find...John snow is also stabbed....it is getting ridiculous.... No build up or time to swallow what happened... Stuff just happens...no reason and WAY TOO MANY cliffhangers, srry lost interest in ALL of them.Rushed ending for a rushed season.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605Well, that concludes Season 5. A mediocre episode that somehow managed to portray most of the cliffhangers from the last two published books.Spoilers if you haven't watched Mother's Mercy.Stannis' armies are broken outside the walls of Winterfell in an off-screen battle that looks far less one-sided than the relative strengths of the armies had us predict. The moment with Brienne had a weird sense of poetic justice, perhaps, but they ended up showing the sword strike off-screen as well, so Stannis' fate is still unresolved. Whether they killed him or not, the showrunners have managed to paint him as a monster in the previous episode that there is no great emotional value to his death. At least his possible last words were asking Brienne to do her duty. So the last surviving king from the War of the Five Kings is... Balon Greyjoy? I hope that the Battle outside Winterfell is far more fulfilling to read about than to watch.Even leaked earlier, Selyse's fate came as a surprise, and Melisandre abandoning Stannis appeared completely out of character. Did she not believe in R'hllor's power any more? Inside Winterfell, Sansa manages to pick her lock, leave her room, climb the broken tower and light her candle. Just after Brienne stopped looking, though. And of all the times for Reek to return to being Theon again, he chooses the moment where it's most convenient for the plot. And cliffhanger #2, what happened after the jump?I rather liked the way Arya killed Meryn, it reminded me of \"Is there gold in the village?\" from the books. But what the heck happened at the House of Black and White? Do they not know how the Faceless Men change their faces? And I thought Jaqen is No One, not Everyone! In any case, there's your cliffhanger #3, did they really blind Arya for disobedience? How did they manage to blind her, though - I didn't see her drink anything. I am glad to see the last of the Bronn-Tyene sparring, and I hope they don't make a spinoff sitcom starring those two. Of all the developments that happened in Dorne, the only one I liked was the conversation between Jaime and Myrcella this episode. That moment barely lasted half a minute, though. So cliffhanger #4 - will Jaime turn the ship back, and is Myrcella going to survive. Remembering the maegi's prophecy, it seems quite unlikely.Apparently nothing happened in the fighting pits of Meereen, as everyone abandoned by Dany appear unscathed. Even more surprising is the arrival of Varys, who was expected to be wreaking havoc in King's Landing at around this time. I have a feeling that Tyrion might be left behind at Meereen as Dany attempts to conquer Westeros. Assuming that's how her story plays out - for we have cliffhanger #5 - Dany being surrounded by the Dothraki which is very nearly the last sentence in Dany's story from the books. The ring she drops was something extra.Now for the title arc - Cersei at King's Landing. This is probably the best moment in this episode, as it invoked the same feelings as when I read that chapter in the books. It doesn't matter how much you hated her actions, you end up feeling sorry for Cersei after her horrendous treatment at the hands of the fanatics. There is an interesting deviation from the books, because Cersei is the only one to take the Walk of Penance, and we realize that it would have been different had she been a man. That casual misogyny of a patriarchal Westeros has been surprisingly sidestepped by the showrunners this time, as the High Septon was treated to a similar fate many episodes ago. I wonder what happens to Loras and Margaery next. Oh and, welcome back Robert Strong.And finally, the biggest moment in the series - I'll start with the positives. I was so glad to see that they just didn't have Olly stab Jon in the back when he was distracted and be done with it. His being the final death blow in a Caesar-ish assassination was executed well. The thing about Benjen was a nice touch, and the lack of information there was as much a disappointment for the fans as it was for Jon. In fact, I would have preferred that there was some wildling who saw Benjen, and then Jon takes some action that goes against his vows ending up in his own brothers butchering him in cold blood.Because that's where my biggest gripe in this episode lies (as far as Jon is concerned). In the book version, Ramsay sends a letter to Jon with demands, and Jon set out to answer it with force\u00a0 with the help of the Free Folk - in essence breaking his vows yet again. The Night's Watch doesn't take part in the affairs of the realm, and Jon is about to march the wildlings to take on the Lord of Winterfell. It might look like a nitpick, but this changes everything - Jon is now killed just for bringing the wildlings in. And it's even made worse with Alliser leading the charge. It doesn't matter that he was followed by Yarwyck and Marsh and whoever it was - their \"For the Watch\" rings so hollow because we know that Alliser has been itching to stab Jon in the stomach for a long long time.The book attempt on Jon was a lot of an unresolved cliffhanger than the show version, because for all intents and purposes Jon appears to be have died. Well, except the fact that they sent Melisandre back to the Wall just in time to whip up some R'hllor magic. I remember a recent interview where Dan Weiss all but confirmed that Jon will be warging into Ghost, so I was surprised we never got to see that quiet wolf baring his fangs at all the treachery. I almost forgot, Sam was last seen driving Gilly and her son in a cart down to Oldtown. The intentions have been switched around, but it didn't really matter.Overall, it's not my least favourite finale episode from the series, and it was much better than some of the other episodes this season, but it just felt like a lot of squandered potential this year. Three stars mostly for Cersei.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605A really good episode as it manages to salvage the season. Like the 10th episode of the previous season,this episode was filled with a lot of deaths. Is 10 becoming the new 9 for game of thrones?The sacrifice from last episode pays dividends as fire and agony from last episode are replaced with melting snow. All falls apart for Stannis after the sacrifice,as half of his army deserts him and his wife commits suicide. Mellisandre deserts him as she sees the end coming. It is somehow disappointing to see a proven military commander fall to the Boltons. He did lose at Blackwater but that was against the combined might of Tyrion Lannister and Tywin Lannister. Brienne finally has a chance to keep her honour as she finds Stannis at her sword's end.I refuse to believe that Stannis is dead. He will probably be nursed back to health by Brienne, as they wait for Ser Davos to arrive at Winterfell with an army of wildlings. As the battle ranges on Sansa is confronted by Myranda. We see glimpses of the old Theon as he tries helping his Sansa. It remains to be seen how the tv series tries to emulate this part of Theon's escape from Ramsay Bolton without the washerman and Stannis.HBO seems to be hell bent on showing the torture of women and girls. Last week had burning small girls while this week had beating up small girls. The mountain would be proud. We bear witness to some eye gouging again as Arya strikes the first name off her to do list. This is the only significant action of the Arya arc which can bear any consequences to the main storyline. Nevertheless the story completely converges in to the book as she is rendered blind by the end of the episode. By doing so they have violated the chronology of the books as she is blind only at the end of the fourth book, yet events in the fifth book have taken place.We are at Dorne again as the Martells bid their farewells to Jaime Lannister. The scene on the boat is awkward, yet executed brilliantly by Jaime Lannister. We now understand that Prince Doran has cause to worry as Ellaria sand takes up brash actions which endanger the life of the heir to Dorne. This will bear many negative consequences if Kings landing can muster up an appropriate response. Their first action would definitely be to behead Trystane Martell and then take Dorne.Mereen has an unexpected bald visitor. Daario picks his team of able men to search for his beloved queen. Tyrion is left out because he is a dwarf and he cannot fight..lame. Dany is trying to tame her dragon as she suddenly realises that she ditched them during last weeks episode. Kings Landing is embroiled in a civil war and is at its weakest. Cersei has her walk of shame. It remains to be seen if she learns anything from her wild adventures or if she simply wages war against the Faith and the Tyrells.Jon Snow got what he deserved.\u00a0 I always expected the kid to kill him. He downfall was imminent after making one terrible decision after another. I do not believe that he will resurrected as many fans think or rather I do not want him to be resurrected. He was just like Ned Stark too naive and too noble and like all other men on the television show he dies.", "\u2605tl;dr: This was the worst finale to probably the most slow-paced and fucked up season of the Game of thrones.*Spoilers Alert, if you're yet to see the episode*Like another review says, the episode seems so slow that you are tempted to watch it at 1.5x or 2x. There were a lot of moments where I needed to check how much of show was still left, and that's never a good sign. For the most part, I couldn't believe that this was a season finale given how dull and desultory the screenplay seemed.To be honest, Stannis' death and Arya killing Meryn Trant did bring some pleasure, but on the whole the episode seemed to jump from one act to another, especially towards the end of the episode. I don't know if it was just me that felt that Jon's death seemed a bit forced and lacking any real depth. It just felt like those last 4 minutes were made to add shock value to an episode featuring an otherwise insipid screenplay.Overall, I expected a lot from this season and was hoping that GoT would actually be one of the rare few which kept getting better and better with each passing season, but as the numbers show this season left many viewers disappointed. I can only hope that the next season would not be such a disaster. In fact, I'm not really sure that I even wanna watch it. It's like House of Cards all over again. (sigh)", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I was trembling with excitement and an equal amount of fear before this episode. Since I've already read the spoilers, I knew Jon Snow got this coming. Nevertheless, it was one of the best and shocking episodes of this season.Stannis. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First they assassinated his character and now his body(?). Not sure about his death. But as an ardent fan of GOT, I don't expect him to come back. Since Brienne is as honorable as Ned (or better than him?), we can assume Stannis is dead as a doornail. I think he (Stannis) knew he was gonna lose when he burned his daughter alive (Life's a circle.) His look when Melisandre talks to him, tell us all. Damn, I loved him, a mistake every fan make.Myrcella. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What a lovely scene that was! No, not the blood bursting one. The one in which she acknowledges Jaimie as her father. Emotions started outpouring and suddenly the poison shows its power. That was so cruel. Showing Jaimie a glimpse of fatherhood and takes it away in seconds? Stupid bitch, Ellaria Sand.Dany and co. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Screw dany. She will be okay. But Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm administering the city? Yes, Tyrion is an accomplished administrator but it's Meereen. Not the Kings Landing where he could throw gold coins whenever he wants. Thank GRRM or David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, somehow Varys manages to come and help Tyrion. It will be interesting.Arya. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My dear Arya Stark. Cute as always and cruel too. Yeah, that pedophile fucker deserved that. But she wasn't supposed to kill him. First a lie and now a murder? A girl shouldn't have done these things. Result, she can't see anymore. Very strict Braavosi people.Theon and Sansa. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That was one good scene. Killing the lover of Ramsay and running away with his wife? Too much for Reek, but not for Theon. He deserves a revenge. Hope he gets one.Jon Snow. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know nothing. It's always your own people. Didn't you know about Mormont's death? And where the fuck was that fucking Ghost? Don't wanna say much. Just come back, okay? We all will be waiting for you. Forgive that fucker, olly. He was just a little boy and acted impulsively. I know you will forgive him. After all, you're Ned's nephew. Looking forward to the next season.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Spoilers Ahead!Another great episode however I'd rate it below Hardhome.1. I felt for Stannis I really did. He was my favorite character and he had such a bad end. I think this was the biggest let down of this season. Stannis was such an awesome and complicated character and the TV series really didn't do justice to him. However they gave him a good death at least or not?\u00a0 2. Arya story has been pretty boring since the start however the kill was bad-ass. Finally some excitement in Arya's story because faceless men are literally faceless.3. Sand snakes finally did their intended. It will interesting to see how it plays out since Trystane Martell (Doran's son) is in Jaime's custody now. Why didn't sad snakes thought of that?4. Jon Snow. I'm pretty sure he'll come back however if he dies then White Walkers (Game of Thrones creature) Valar Morghulis (expression). (Kill them all!)", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605The Season finale was not anything very interesting, but was far from boring like the previous episode. I might have given it a 3 star had it been in any of the previous seasons. The finale had nothing unexpected (at least for book-readers). But after the debacle, that's the ninth episode, this was a welcome change.Show starts with Stannis preparing to siege Winterfell. The Red Priestess observes the weather getting better, thereby inferring R'hllor has accepted the sacrifice. But Stannis is welcomed by the news of the sellswords deserting him, followed by the news of his wife taking her own life. With the odds stacked against Stannis, Melissandre, who by now realizes that Stannis is not Azor Ahai, leaves the camp to move to Castle Black (She must have realized Jon is Azor Ahai). Boltons make little work of the weary troops of Stannis, who by now would have lost any confidence in the endeavor, with a pre-emptive strike. But I was surprised that Ramsay himself didn't make sure Stannis was put to the sword. An injured Stannis encounter Brienne, who abandons her post from where the beacon at Winterfell is visible, who appears to keep her vow by killing Stannis. But as the body is not shown the situation is ambiguous as what happened.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile at Winterfell, Theon saves Sansa from Myranda and helps her escape by killing Myranda. It was not expected of Reek to find the Theon inside him, but that little bit he found inside him was enough to help Sansa. It's shown that both Sansa and Theon jumping from the walls of Winterfell. We can safely assume they are jumping onto the snow. But with Castle Black quite far and them not having any horses, they ideally would not survive the harsh weather conditions. Couple that with the scouting parties Ramsay will deploy once he finds out his \"Queen\" is missing, we can assume Theon's life might not be spared this time.At Braavos now. It's not quite surprising to find Arya cut a name of her list by exacting revenge on Meryn Trant. It was a brutal way to kill him, but at some level he might have deserved it. She has started to show the assassin in her by the way she got inside Trant's room. But The Many-faced god has his rules and now Arya has to pay the price for carrying out a death which was not a contract. She loses her eyesight as the punishment. This is the only part of the show that is lagging the books as in the books she has regained her sight. But after 9 episodes of absolute nothing at Braavos this was far from unexpected.The way Dorne is portrayed in the show is ludicrous. Myrcella is shown to be murdered in a way fitting for the Sand Snakes, by posion. But by that the whole point of including Jaime's journey to Dorne has become a pointless unwanted addition to the show. The Sand Snakes could have very well done that before Jaime's arrival. Now that whole Jaime-Bronn journey to Dorne is rendered useless. Ellaria would ideally take the entire blame for this operation and most likely will face a lifetime inside the cells in Dorne, letting Sand Snakes off the hook. But this move has weakened Dorne's position as Trystane will now be a hostage in King's Landing. Had Sand Snakes carried out the assassination in Dorne itself, Trystane would have been safe. Once Cersei comes to know about Myrcella, Trystane will fall prey to Ser Robert Strong's blade (wait, we haven't reached Robert Strong yet, eh). Dorne can now ready themselves for the inevitable war, though there is hardly any way Dorne is going to lose this one.In Mereen, Tyrion is made the governor to rule mereen in Dany's stead as Jorah and Daario start their exploration to find the missing queen. How any of them got out of the ambush is still unknown, may be Unsullied would have reached the pits after Dany decided to take flying lessons abandoning her subjects. Varys is shown to have reached Mereen and inside the castle. How he reached inside the castle without alerting Tyrion is quite strange. Meanwhile Dany is trying to fly Drogon again, looks like flying lessons didn't go well as Drogon seems least interested (Dany is least bothered by the countless spears that went through the poor flying machine). Dany is surrounded by the Dothraki horde when she goes searching for food. What happens next is ambiguous and we can only find out in the next season. In King's Landing, Cersei has pleaded guilty to her adultery involving Lancel and seeks atonement. Since she pleads not guilty for the charges of incest she has to stand a trial. But meanwhile she has to do the \"Walk of Shame\" as atonement for her sins. By the way crowd reacts, it's quite evident that Cersei has lost the appeal in the capitol and Tommen has been far from from impressive as a ruler. Qyburn has rejuvenated Mountain, but in his form, as Ser Robert Strong. May be he will fight for Cersei in her trial by combat for the other charges of sin. I wonder who will the Faith stage as their Champion??!!To the Wall. Earlier in the episode we are seeing Sam heading to Citadel along with Gilly, making Jon lose his only ally at the Castle Black. In the closing scenes we are shown Olly luring Jon to a secluded area of Castle Black with the mention of Benjen Stark. There a section of Night's Watch awaits for Jon to betray him for his decision to bring Wildlings to the Black. Jon is stabbed repeated by them while murmuring \"For The Black\". What might await the Black will mostly be a civil war. Will Wildlings exact revenge for Jon is to be seen.This episode was mainly tying up the loose ends of this season. I have to credit them for the way this was shot, with hardly any scene seeming to bore us. Jon in all likelihood is dead, but I won't put my bets on him staying dead. What impressed me was that Stannis, even at the face of death, upholds duty, asking Brienne to do her duty by executing him.What next for Davos is to be seen. When you look back, you find that the story has progressed very little in this season. I am hoping Winds of Winter would be released next year, with very little expectation from D&D.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Damn, I thought this was another great episode! Across-the-board super-interesting story arc climaxes:Jon Snow: wow I didn't see that coming, but it totally makes senseCersei's walk: amazing, intenseStannis ending: loved itMyrcella Baratheon/Lannister: brutalTheon and Sansa: great - we needed thatArya: super-dramaticEh, the stuff with Daenerys and her merry men was OK, but not great; but that was a transitional set up to next season.If you haven't read the books, this was yet another great, super-entertaining episode. I think the book readers have a standard that may be too high.", "I typically recap all Game of Thrones' episodes, and I loved analyzing \"Mother's Mercy.\"\u00a0 You can read my thorough (and humorous) review here, as it was featured on my blog See, Here's the Thing.\u00a0 A few areas of focus included:MeereenDorneStannis' CampSansa's Escape "]}, "51": {"id": "s06e01", "name": "The Red Woman", "script": "(theme music playing)   (wind blowing)  (wolf howling)  (howling continues)  (howling continues)  (door rattles)  (howling continues)  (door rattling)  (wolf whimpering)  (rattling continues)  (howling continues)  (Ghost whimpering, howling)  - (rattling continues) - (whimpering, howling continue)  Man: It's coming from the courtyard.  - (Ghost howling) - Man #2: It's the Lord Commander!

We need all the help we can get.  (knocking on door)  Melisandre: Ser Davos.  (door closes)  Melisandre: I saw him in the flames  fighting at Winterfell.  I can't speak for the flames  but he's gone.  (men shouting)  Man: He was our Lord Commander.  Man #2: He never should have been!  (pounds)  - You all know why you're here. - (shouting stops)  (men murmuring)  Jon Snow is dead.  Who killed him?  - I did. - (shouting resumes)  And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck  and the other officers in this castle.  - Murderers! - Traitors!  - (men shouting) - (pounds on table)  - You're right! - (shouting stops)  We've committed treason, all of us.  Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.  I had no love for him.  That was no secret.  But I never once disobeyed an order.  Loyalty is the foundation  on which the Night's Watch is built.  And the Watch means everything to me.  I have given my life,  we have all given our lives to the Night's Watch.  Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch.  He let the wildlings through our gates  as no Lord Commander has ever done before.  He gave them the very land on which they reaved  and raped and murdered.  Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right,  I've no doubt about that.  And what he thought was right would have been the end of us.  He thrust a terrible choice upon us.  And we made it.  (men murmuring)  (whimpering)  Davos: He'll have seen we didn't come.  Thorne will have made it official by now.  Castle Black is his.  I don't care who's sitting at the high table.  Jon was my friend.  And those fuckers butchered him.  Now we return the favor.  We don't have the numbers.  - We have a direwolf. - It's not enough.  I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,  but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.  If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.  We all die today.  I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.  We need to fight, but we don't need to die.  - Not if we have help. - Who is gonna help us?  You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.  Bolt the door.  Don't let anyone in.  I'll be back as soon as I can.  (door closes)  (bolt clicks)  (wind howling)  Ramsay: She was 11 the first time I saw her.  The kennelmaster's daughter.  She smelled of dog.  I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me.  You certainly were.  Myranda wasn't, though.  What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?  She was fearless.  There was nothing she wouldn't do.  Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.  I wish you could be here to watch.  Maester: Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?  Or would you rather the men build a pyre?  Buried, burned?  This is good meat.  Feed it to the hounds.  Roose: Your command of the cavalry was impressive.  Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead.  Do you know who struck the killing blow?  - No. - A shame.  I'd reward the man.  Still, a great victory.  Do you feel like a victor?  I rebelled against the crown  to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.  Do you think that burning wagons in the night  and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons  is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?  No.  A reckoning will come.  We need the North to face it.  The entire North.  They won't back us without Sansa Stark.  We no longer have Sansa Stark.  You played your games with her.  You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone.  I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.  They won't get far.  I'm glad to hear it.  Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir.  And without an heir, well  let's hope the maesters are right  and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.  (dogs barking)  (barking continues)  (panting)  We can't stop.  (barking continues)  We have to cross here.  - (gasps) I can't. - It's the only way to throw off the hounds.  But it's too cold. I can't. I won't make it. I'll die.  I've seen what his hounds do to a person.  This way is better.  (barking continues)  (gasping)  (shivering)  (gasping)  Over here. Come on.  (shivering)  Sansa.  Sansa.  (dogs barking)  Man: Tell them to settle down!  Stay here. I'll lure them away.  No, I won't make it without you.  You will.  Go north, only north.  Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.  He'll help you.  (barking, howling)  (men shouting)  Man: See somebody, eh?  - Man #2: There they are! - Man #3: Get them!  Where is Lady Bolton?  - Dead. - Liar.  Theon: She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts.  I left her to die in the snow.  (barking)  Got something! Run!  (horse whinnies)  Man: Hyah!  - (dogs barking) - (men shouting)  (whimpering)  - (horse whinnies) - Man #2: Resist. Stay.  (growling, barking)  - (barking continues) - Man #2: Stay.

I swear it by the old gods and the new.  And I vow  that you shall always have a place by my hearth  and  Meat and mead at my table.  meat and mead at my table.  And I pledge to ask no service of you  that might bring you dishonor.  I swear it by the old gods and the new.  Arise.  (seagulls screeching)  (door opens)  Handmaiden: Your Grace, I'm sorry to disturb you.  A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.  Myrcella.  (seagull screeching)  (bell tolling)  Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?  Mother.  All I could think about when she died  was what would happen to her now.  Every day, every night,  what does Mama look like now?  Has she started to bloat?  Has her skin turned black?  Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.  I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.  Shh, shh. Don't think about it.  I have to.  I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.  She's not suffering. She's gone.  No one can hurt her anymore.  She was good.  From her first breath, she was so sweet.  I don't know where she came from.  She was nothing like me.  No meanness, no jealousy, just good.  I know.  I thought if I could make something so good,  so pure  - maybe I'm not a monster. - Listen-- listen to me.  She was my daughter and I failed her.  No, I knew this would happen.  The witch told me years ago.  She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.  \"And gold their shrouds.\"  Everything she said came true.  You couldn't have stopped it.  It's prophecy. It's fate.  - You don't believe that. - Of course I do.  You told me yourself when Father died.  You said we had to stay together.  You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours.  That was a prophecy, too.  I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.  Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate.  Fuck everyone who isn't us.  We're the only ones who matter,  the only ones in this world.  And everything they've taken from us,  we're going to take back and more.  We're going to take everything there is.  \"The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men.  They scream in agony and their shame is so great,  they do not feel the flames,  for now they see if not for a single sin  they concealed, they were saved.\"  I'd like to see my brother.  - Confess. - Please.  How is he? At least tell me that.  Confess.  I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.  Sinners don't make demands.  They make confessions.  (gasps)  (door opens)  Septa Unella.  (sighs) Our other guests need you.  - (gasps) - There.  Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.  I'll speak with her.  My brother, can you tell me how he is?  It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.  Your husband misses you dearly.  The love between a man and wife is sacred.  It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.  But sin leads us away from the sacred.  And only confession can purge sin.  I have nothing to confess.  So you believe you are pure?  Perfect?  Wholly without sin?  None of us are.  You have started down the path.  But you have many miles to go.  (door opens, closes)  I always envied Oberyn.  He lived.  He truly lived.  Sailed around the world.  Fought men from every country.  Lay with the most beautiful women alive.  - And men. - And men.  He experienced everything  while I sat here in Dorne  trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.  But that is life.  We each have our roles.  Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.  And I was born to rule.  The gods are not fools.  You would have been a lousy adventurer.  And Oberyn, pfft,  he would have been a terrible ruler.  Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?  Maester: Prince Doran.  The Princess Myrcella.  (gasping)  When was the last time you left this palace?  You don't know your own people.  - Their disgust for you. - (Doran coughing)  Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.  Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing.  You're not a Dornishman.  You're not our prince.  My son Trystane  (scoffs)  Your son is weak just like you.  And weak men will never rule Dorne again.  I told you I'm not hungry.  We're not here to feed you.  We're here to kill you.  You want her to do it or me?  We are family. I don't want to hurt you.  Her or me?  You.  Good.  Smart boy.  You're a greedy bitch, you know that?  (door opens, door closes)  Tyrion: We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city  from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.  We'll be fine.  We're dressed like common merchants.  You walk like a rich person.  You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?  You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property.  I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.  It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore.  Because you have no cock.  (baby fussing)      She thinks you want to eat her baby.        (speaks Valyrian)  - Varys: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian. - I know what mhysa means.  - Varys: Who wrote it? - Hard to know.  Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.  The Sons of the Harpy?  Very possibly.  Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property,  told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.  You can see why they're unhappy.  Of course,  it could also be the freed men.        Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.  She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.          It's a problem.  Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.  Whoever you are, wherever you go,  someone in this city wants to murder you.  We can't fight an enemy we don't know.  The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack  in the fighting pits very carefully,  which means they take orders from someone.  And have you started looking for that someone?  My little birds have already taken wing.  Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.  (men shouting in Valyrian)  - (people shouting) - (bell tolling)  - (shouting continues) - (bell continues tolling)  Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.  Goat?  Ram.  You think our friend got him?  Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn.  We're on the right path, then.  Daario: Perhaps she's tired of being queen.  I don't think she likes it very much.  She's too smart to like it.  Maybe she's flown somewhere else,  somewhere far away from men like us.  I've been all over the world.  There's no escaping men like us.  There's no escaping her, eh?  You keep coming back. Why?  You know why.  Isn't it frustrating  wanting someone who doesn't want you back?  Of course it is.  You're a romantic. I admire that.  Sometimes I look at you and I think,  \"So that's what I'll be like when I grow old.\"  If you grow old.  If I grow old.  I hope I do.  I want to see what the world looks like  when she's done conquering it.  So do I.  Daario: Huh, an army?  Not an army.  A horde.  Dothraki?  They have her.  (people shouting)  - (shouts in Dothraki) - (groans)                  (chuckles, kisses)            No.                                                  (men laugh)                                                        (chatter)  (distant dog barking)  Woman: But there has to be a price to pay for everything.  Man: I know, but have you tried telling him that?  (chatter continues)  Thank you.  Man: Who'd go there after what happened to that Kingsguard?  - Man #2: Probably had it coming. - Man: Maybe so,  but I'm not risking it.  - Man #2: Just can't do it. - Man: All right.  Woman: Honesty as well. He gets it.  (chatter continues)  Waif: Are you listening, blind girl?  Do you hear them talking?  Do any of them talk to you?  No.  So sad.  (coins jingle)  - (groans) - Stand and fight, blind girl.  I can't see.  That's your problem, not mine.  (groans)  (grunts)  (panting)  (grunts)  See you tomorrow.  (panting)  (growling)  (pounding)  Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.  We are both anointed knights.  Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.  Alliser: I will grant amnesty to all brothers  who throw down their arms before nightfall.  And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south  a free man with a fresh horse.  Davos: And some mutton.  I'd like some mutton.  - What? - I'm not much of a hunter.  I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it south without starving.  We'll give you food.  You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like.  Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose.  But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.  Thank you, Ser Alliser.  We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.  (footsteps departing)  Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.  In my learned opinion, we open that door--  And they'll slaughter us all.  They want to come in, they're gonna come in.  - Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them. - Edd is our only chance.  It's a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.  There's always the Red Woman.  What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?  You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.", "summary": ["Plot At Castle Black, Thorne defends his treason while Edd and Davos defend themselves. Sansa and Theon race the cold and the hounds.  Summary In the North Brienne helps save Sansa S6 Brienne and Podrick meet Sansa and Theon.  Ramsay and Maester Wolkan attend to the dead body of Myranda. Ramsay remembers the first time he met her, stating that while other people were afraid of him, she wasn't. The Maester asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre. Ramsay says she is good meat and they should feed her to the hounds.  Theon and Sansa, having survived the fall from Winterfell's wall, run through the Wolfswood realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them. Theon tries to hide their scent by crossing a river. Guiding a frightened Sansa, they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging Sansa to try to keep her warm. Hearing the dogs still after them, Theon tries to lead them away, telling Sansa to keep heading north for Jon and Castle Black. A group of Bolton men sent by Ramsay, with the Bastard's Girls, find them. Theon claims Sansa was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die, but the dogs find her. The leader mocks Theon over what Ramsay will do to him now and prepares to bring them back to Winterfell. Brienne and Podrick arrive and a fight begins. Brienne kills most of them while Podrick displays the techniques she taught him, managing to kill one. He is then attacked by another and briefly holds his own before being knocked down but Theon grabs a sword and kills the Bolton man. Sansa accepts Brienne into her service. Where they go next is uncertain.  Roose Bolton meets with Ramsay afterward and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of Stannis Baratheon makes him feel like a \"winner\" now that they've lost Sansa. A Lannister army marching north could easily overwhelm the Bolton troops at Winterfell and the Dreadfort. Ramsay assures his father they will recapture Sansa as he's sent his best men to find her. Roose continues that they need her to rally the north against the Lannisters, if need be, and subtly warns Ramsay that if he fails to recapture her, his unborn brother will become his heir.  In Braavos Game-of-thrones-season-6-image-maisie-williams In Braavos, Arya faces The Waif  Arya is blind and begs for money in the streets, when the Waif approaches her with two fighting sticks, and gives her one. Arya explains that she can't fight because she's blind, the Waif answers \"that's not my problem\" and starts beating her. Arya poorly tries to defend herself but fails miserably. The Waif stops and says that they'll meet tomorrow.  In Meereen The Red Woman 08 Varys and Tyrion walking through Meereen.  Varys and Tyrion are seen walking through the city, dressed as merchants. After coming upon a starving woman and her baby, Tyrion offers a coin, saying the money is for the baby, to eat. His poor Valyrian frightens the woman who thinks that he wants to eat her baby. Varys intercedes, explaining to the woman the money is so the baby can eat. The relieved woman accepts Tyrion's generosity.  As they continue their walk through the city, Tyrion states that they need to find the leader of the Sons of the Harpy in order to bring peace to Meereen. Varys said that his spies have been sent all over the city, and that soon they will bring him information. Their conversation is interrupted by a crowd of screaming people running from a huge cloud of smoke. The two make their way towards the origin of the smoke: all the ships in the harbor have been set aflame.  In the Dothraki Sea The Red Woman 01 Daenerys is captured and offered to Khal Moro.  Daario and Jorah are looking for Daenerys, and come upon the charred remains of a ram. They note numerous hoof prints on the ground, making Jorah realize that the Dothraki have been here. On the ground, he finds the ring that Daenerys intentionally dropped.  Daenerys is shown walking with her hands bound, and two Dothraki take her to Khal Moro as a gift. The Khal wants to rape her, but she explains who she is, Khal Drogo's widow. The Khal unbinds her and promises her that she will not be harmed. When Daenerys asks to be escorted back to Meereen in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return, Moro's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of Vaes Dothrak with the other Khals' widows for the remainder of her days and become a Dosh khaleen.  In Dorne Doran martell dying and dead season 6 Doran dies after Ellaria's deception.  Ellaria helps Doran get to his wheelchair, as they both reminisce about Oberyn, with Doran stating how he envied his late brother for the adventurous life he led. Ellaria states that Doran would have made a bad adventurer, while Oberyn would have been a bad ruler. After settling into his chair, Maester Caleotte brings him a message that Myrcella has died. Before he can give an order, Tyene stabs Areo Hotah in the back, killing him, while Ellaria stabs Doran in the chest. As he lies on the floor his guards do nothing, indicating they have sided with Ellaria. As she twists her knife into Doran, Ellaria angrily says he remained passive despite the brutal deaths of both his sister and brother, and that the people of Dorne are with her, now. As he is gasping, Doran begs Ellaria to spare Trystane, but Ellaria coldly scoffs at him. Doran then dies in a pool of his own blood.  In King's Landing Game-of-thrones-season-6-image-ship Myrcella's corpse arrives from Dorne.  Cersei is sitting alone in her room, when a servant enters and announces that a ship from Dorne has arrived. Realizing that Myrcella has come home, she joyfully runs down to the harbor, only to see a grim-faced Jaime alongside a shrouded body. She tearfully realizes that her daughter has died.  Later, in the Red Keep, Cersei asks Jaime when was the first time he saw a dead body, to which Jaime replies their mother's. Cersei tells of her memory of the horror she felt after first seeing her mother's corpse, and wishes not to see it happen to Myrcella.  Meanwhile, Margaery is still imprisoned by the Faith, and the High Sparrow comes to visit her. She asks about her brother, Loras, but he tells her that she has to confess first. When she admits that nobody is without sin, he tells her that she is on the right path but still has a long way to go.  Obara and Nymeria arrive on Prince Trystane's ship, announcing their intention to kill him. Nymeria offers Trystane the choice of which one of the Sands he'd like to fight, and he chooses Nymeria, only to be killed when Obara impales him through the back of his head as he turns his back on her.  At the Wall At the Wall, the mutineers have left Jon's body where he fell. Ghost is scratching at the door in grief and howling, which gets the attention of several people, including Ser Davos, who leaves his room to investigate. Davos finds Jon's dead body just before Edd and some other brothers arrive. They take the body inside where Edd clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing Jon's eyes. Davos asks if Edd trusts any of his brothers, and Edd replies, \"The ones in this room.\" Davos convinces Edd to go bring Ghost in, deciding that they need all the help they can get. Melisandre arrives, stating she saw Jon fighting in Winterfell in the flames. Davos and the black brothers doubt the now dead Lord Commander could do such a thing and she returns to her room.  Alliser Thorne, Othell Yarwyck, and Bowen Marsh hold a meeting with the remaining black brothers stationed at Castle Black and explain their reasoning for killing the Lord Commander. Most of the brothers come to understand them and side with the mutineers. Back inside the room, Davos notes Thorne is sure to have made his move by now. In response, Edd states he doesn't care because Jon was his friend and they butchered him and he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge. Davos responds they are hopelessly outnumbered, stating Ghost isn't enough when Edd brings him up, before reminding them there are others nearby who owe Jon their lives. Realizing he means the Wildlings, Edd instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help.  Thorne and senior members of the Watch approach the room, with members of the Watch in tow bearing arms. Thorne speaks to Davos through the locked door and promises full amnesty for the members of the Watch. To Davos he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes, and that he can take Melisandre with him. Ser Davos mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton. Ser Davos tells Thorne he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve, so he needs some mutton for his trip. Thorne promises him food will be provided. Ser Thorne says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders by sundown.  OldMelisandre Melisandre without her magical glamor of youth.  Alone in her bedroom, Melisandre appears despondent, looking as if she has been betrayed and led astray by The Lord of Light. On a table next to her bed are various containers, some small that contain potions and other liquids. She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body. She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror. When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow. In the mirror, Melisandre's reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be, a frail old woman with sagging breasts, leathery skin and thin wispy white hair. Fully nude, with her head bowed down in a despondent manner, she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her. "], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606As far as season premieres go, this one was not so bad. It touched upon most, if not all of the cliffhangers that were left unanswered at the end of last year's season finale.Spoilers if you haven't watched Season 6 Episode 1. A significant portion of the episode - which I think was pretty short at only 45 minutes of runtime - was dedicated to the events at the Wall, which was not as chaotic as I thought at would be. We'll have to wait for next week for things to happen - for now, the Watch is reeling with the information that their Lord Commander is dead. Alliser appears to convince, except for a handful of people including Dolorous Edd, that Jon's death was a necessary one. While Edd goes to get the help of Tormund and the other wildlings, Davos and the last few loyal members of the Watch have locked themselves in a room with Ghost and Jon's body. I'm not sure what they are planning to achieve - with no notion of resurrection in their minds - perhaps, they are just trying to prevent the desecration of Jon's corpse, wanting to give him a proper funeral. Melisandre is shaken, possibly in a state where she's questioning her faith. Oh and, fan speculation that she's extremely old, glamouring herself to look young has been confirmed.Elsewhere in the north, Roose congratulates Ramsay on his victory against Stannis, but is not happy that Sansa had run away. We see Ramsay's tender moment, when he\u00a0 remembers how he met Myranda - before he orders that her body be fed to his hounds. Classic Ramsay. Roose places a thinly veiled threat to Ramsay - if they don't get Sansa back, Ramsay is not likely to inherit the Bolton title. This is probably the only story arc that might end up in an unpredictable way. Between the Winterfell and the Wall, somewhere in the cold, Theon and Sansa are running, and even crossing a fairly wide stream doesn't help them escape Ramsay's hounds. But just as they were about to be captured and taken back to Winterfell, enter Brienne and Pod, who swear fealty to Sansa. It's highly likely that they will continue on to the Wall.In King's Landing, Cersei is overjoyed to hear about the return of her daughter, but that turned to ashes as Myrcella has died from Ellaria's poison. Surprisingly, she doesn't blame Jaime and rage at him, but is fully dejected, remembering the maegi's prophecy. We get a look at Margaery in her cell, seemingly not very far from confessing to her brother's \"crimes\". Down south, the ruination of Dorne is almost complete, as House Martell - which had ruled Dorne for thousands of years - is brought to an abrupt end with a very easy coup. All it took was two daggers, a spear and a completely indifferent Dornish guard. And for some reason I thought Trystane went to King's Landing with Myrcella. With Ellaria grabbing power, that Dorne will be ruled by \"weak men\" no longer, I suspect we'll get to see them declare for Dany when she comes to Westeros. I really hope we don't see them for a while though, I've had enough.Across the Narrow Sea, there is a short montage of the blind beggar girl being beaten with a staff, a look at Tyrion and Varys at Meereen, watching helplessly as their fleet is set aflame, and Dany's ring is very easily found by Jorah and Daario, with enough hoof prints around it to inform them that Dany is with the Dothraki. Another surprise is that it wasn't Jhaqo, like in the books, or even Pono who was one of Drogo's kos, who finds Daenerys, but the riders of one Khal Moro. There is a Moro in the books, who came to Drogo's wedding - apparently not in the show, for he doesn't recognize Dany at all. And here's where it gets convenient, he's quite possibly the most patient of khals, patiently listening to everything Dany has to say. And finally, with the realization that Dany is Drogo's widow, he promises her safety, and as expected she will be taken to Vaes Dothrak. Where did Drogon fly off to?And, that's it. There was nothing much in the episode for them to screw up, but they still managed to make a mess of Dorne. 7/10.", "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606Well, Game of Thrones is back, and guess what, the first episode was BORING. To be fair though, the first episode is hardly where interesting things happen. But it did cover a lot of cliffhangers from last season. Very gladly, the episode started with the cliffhanger of JonSnow. Dead Jon Snow. Well, we all know he can\u2019t be dead. Never mind that they killed off Ned Stark, our first love, and thenRobb, and even that little twit Joffrey, Jon Snow just can\u2019t be dead. And as book readers, may of us can tell with near certainty that he can\u2019t be dead. Nope. But for the show, at the moment, he\u2019s dead and the Night\u2019s Watch has accepted it. It was a pleasant feeling to watch Ser Davos rouse up the support of the handful of good folks in the Night\u2019s Watch(and Ghost) to what looks like a call to arms for the Wildlings. Dolorous Edd is now the sudden and willing leader here. The show just made it look a little too easy when Allister Thorne just blandly claimed responsibility for the killing and actually named others who co-conspired with him. Olly, the little boy, seems to be set up to be Joffrey v2. When he dies \u2013 and mark my words, he will die \u2013 it will be a source of great pleasure to very many of us.\u00a0 And \u201ceasy\u201d is just how I would describe everything that happened. Sansa escapes and bam! Deus ex machina Brienne turns up to help her just in time. (WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOGS??) Dorne was easy too. Areo Hotah killed by a stab on the back by tiny Tyene?Just not digestible. While I thought Ellaria\u2019s lip poison that killed Myrcella was a surprisingly clever idea, stabbing of Doran Martell while the guards watch was easy. It implies one of two things \u2013 either the guards were in on the idea and are connected with the Sand Snakes, or they\u2019re too scared of them. Neither of the group mentality makes sense, just like how the brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch simply accepting Allister Thorne\u2019s \u201cOh yeah, I killed him now stfu,\u201d without revolt. Same with Trystane Martell choosing who's to kill him, Nymeria or Obara, and predictably get cheated of it. It was a botched plot where the writers just wanted to make a dramatic point because, hopefully, we have more interesting things in the next few episodes. Dorne does raise a question, though. There\u2019s has been a violent overthrow of a well-loved regime, a cold murder of a diplomatic alliance. Does this mean war? Cersei and Jaime have accepted Myrcella\u2019s death and in fact are more emboldened than before. It\u2019s hard to tell what Jaime is actually thinking (he is very different in the books at this point), but together, these two could be powerful. Dorne\u2019s been simmering for a while, just waiting to blow up. My opinion is that there\u2019s going to be a showdown between Cersei and Ellaria. I loved Ramsay Bolton. As ever, he was predictably unpredictable and despicable. As he grieved in his own way over Myranda\u2019s body,I was mentally placing my money on him ordering someone to send the corpse up to his bedroom for the night, but throwing it to the dogs just made more sense. Roose threatens Ramsay by stating that if he doesn't bring Sansa back, he would legitimize his own future son instead. The Boltons don't get along and are held together only by their greed for power. It sure is going to be interesting to watch them turn on each other and crumble. Sansa\u2019s transformation is making great progress! She\u2019s grown from a stubborn little girl living in her own little fantasy world of princes and knights, to someone who\u2019s dearest people are violently taken from her, to someone who lets the men in her life play her like a pawn because she\u2019s unable to overcome her victimization, to finally someone who makes choices that dictate her course of life. Arya\u2019s token scene didn\u2019t tell much except for the fact that she\u2019s still blind, but she\u2019s soon going to become a deadly blind ninja. Margery's token scenes showed nothing either, except that she's still there, her love for her brother is greater than that for her baby husband, and that might probably never confess. Tyrion's token scene showed that he has a long way to go before he makes himself acceptable to the locals.Dany\u2019s scenes were a tad predictable, except for the Dothraki humor which brought a refreshing change to the otherwise fearless-warrior image that the people have. A Khal not touching another Khal\u2019s widow was another easy plot point that made the savage Dothraki seem suddenly human, but Dany is going to be escorted to Vaes Dothrak, the land of the widows. Come on, Drogon! Bran is still missing. He was gone all of last season and wasn\u2019t there in the first episode. We can only hope that his powers have grown tremendously and he has graduated a fair bit from warging into Summer and Hodor alone. Warging raises a lot of questions. Can you warg into other humans? Into any other living being? What about inanimate objects? And how far away should someone be for Bran to warg into them? Could he warg into Ghost at CastleBlack? (That wasn\u2019t a spoiler from the books btw, the show has progressed beyond the books at Castle Black). Melisandre.. well, we all knew she was old. Now we know how old she really is. The reduction of this incredibly powerful woman to someone so aged, slow, weak, nearly withering away, and human, was an unexpected end to an otherwise ordinary\u00a0 2/5\u00a0 episode.Takeaways from this episode and what I expect this season:1. Revolt in the Night\u2019s Watch.2. War waiting to break out between King\u2019s Landing and Dorne.3. More empowerment to women: Sansa, Brienne, Cersei, Ellaria, Sand Snakes, Arya, Dany, and the suddenly frail Melisandre.\u00a0 4. The dragons are coming.", "1- 10, I'd give it an 8. This season premiere was good.It started where the last episode from Season 5 left off.\u00a0 The title was interesting, I thought the Red Woman would do something extraordinary or they'd show who she truly is and the show did, though I didn't expect in that way. Cersei was happy when told that Jaime is back because she thought she'd see Myrcella but her smile disappeared as quickly when she realized she's dead. Dorne is a mess. :D I guess they're really doing their own version of Dorne events, I hope it will make sense though but they're intelligent people so maybe they'll pull it off. One of my favorite parts of the episode was Sansa and Theon's escape because REEK was wonderful. Spoilers Wall - Having Davos in there helped to delay the chaos, I think. It would've been bloody if he was not there because Jon's friends and others loyal to him were willing to kill without having a plan. So no more killing happened, for the meantime. Some of loyals stayed inside the room while one of them will gather other men who are loyal to Jon Snow, I think they'll call upon the wildlings to fight with them. Sansa and Theon (FAVORITE) -\u00a0 Reek leading the way and trying his best to save Sansa was wonderful to watch. He was really brave right there. Sansa's learning *happy dance*. Those lines she said when she was accepting Brienne swore fealty..goosebumps. Dorne - Didn't expect things would be like but yeah, interesting how things will turn out. Arya - was briefly showed and she's training to use her senses. One training sesh and she's done. No other arya scenes. I didn't expect much airtime for her, anyway. King's Landing - Cersei was sad and realized the prophecy's coming true. A good foreshadowing about Tommen's fate. I think she was sad that Myrcella's dead and fearful at the same time because..prophecy. I'm looking forward to many things for Jaime this season. I wanted to see the change of heart towards Cersei. Meereen - It was nice to see Tyrion and Varys. I think they just automatically took in the responsibility of taking care of the city since Dany flew off. And man, they're in a helpless situation..again. Daenerys - Good thing Dany was found by Khal Moro. He seems less barbaric. LOLed when Dany said her titles because God, she never learns. It seems that she's being driven deeper and deeper into the Dothraki culture. I wonder how she'd take all these things..a training to be a Queen of Westeros or a wake up call that this is where she belongs? Up to her.The Red Woman - This one's bit interesting and now I'll review other episodes where the red woman was present. I'll check what is up with her. That ending was interesting. And it shows the connection of the Lord of Light, Jon Snow, and the Azor Ahai. I think it's possible that the red woman will sacrifice herself to bring back Jon Snow. All in all, it was a good premiere. It set what we will see and can expect from this season. So, I will wait for that Dorne plot to unravel and see what this season have in store for us. It's still episode 1 after all. I truly love the Sansa part. I think Sansa scenes would be one of the best things we will see this season. Looking forward to BRAN, Tower of Joy, and Iron Islands scenes. Of course, Jon Snow. :) ", "The Day has finally arrived.The Day when book readers no longer have the smug superiority of knowing what happens.The Day where we officially have no basis to say whether the book or show is better.The Day where we have to address all the problems GRRM created in book five.Crap.SPOILERS AHEADFor the record, I've read all of GRRM's books, so watching this episode felt very strange to me. It's kind of exhilarating not knowing what happens, and I look forward to some real suspense this season.On the other hand, well. We'll get to that.Let's start with the things I liked:The Stark girls continue to be a highlight. I'm so glad we've finally gotten to blind Arya, and I hope the Faceless Man plotline speeds up. And yay, Sansa is finally away from Ramsay and maybe can actually become her own woman now, you know, with more agency and less rape. I was so glad to see her reunite with Brienne and accept Brienne's service.Tyrion in Meereen with Varys is wonderful. Just wonderful. I could do an entire show of this. I love seeing Tyrion back in charge, and having Varys there with him is a great change from the books that allows the two of them to play off each other.Seeing Dany back among the Dothraki is also a wonderful change of pace. She was a much better Khaleesi than a Queen of Meereen, and seeing her shock the Khal and his wives with her knowledge of Dothraki and her position was a highlight of the episode - as was seeing her shock and anger when they told her she was going to Vaes Dothrak (as we all guessed).I'm a fan of the Jorah/Daario buddy cop show, even if they found Dany's ring way too easily.And now the not-so-great:Dorne. WHAT THE HELL. Dorne was bad enough last season, with all the characters turned into caricatures of their book-selves and the death of Myrcella. My desire to shoot the Sand Snakes hasn't changed, which is unfortunate because I really liked them in the books. And it was PAINFUL to watch Doran and Areo Hotah die. The two of them are wonderful and nuanced in the books, and their undignified deaths in the show were just the shit icing on a shitty Dornish cake.Me, watching the Dornish scenesGet Jaime away from Cersei already. Jaime's arc was the main reason I liked Feast for Crows - I loved that he had finally realized what a horrible person he had been and what a horrible person his sister still was. I really want Show!Jaime to get with the program here.My soul cries for lack of Petyr Baelish. I simply MUST know what shenanigans he's up to.And in the category of things I don't know how to react to - that last scene. On the one hand, it was a nice reveal that Melisandre is not as she appears and that she has more power than one might guess. On the other hand...I did NOT need to see that. A shoulders-up reveal would have been fine. Really. I promise.Overall though, this was a solid start to the season. I'd give it a seven out of ten.Unanswered QuestionsIS JON SNOW DEAD FOR REALSIES AND FOREVER AGHGHGHGHGH?Seriously though, where is Baelish?What was Drogon doing while Dany was captured?How are they going to reintroduce characters that have been off the show for over a season?", "I was excited to finally see a new episode of Game of Thrones, and it definitely didn't let me down. The episode told us everything we needed to know for the new season, establishing exactly where everyone was and setting up new storylines. Some parts were a bit disappointing (*cough* - Dorne - *cough*), but overall, it was an enjoyable episode.Spoilers below if you haven't seen the episode yet!So we start where we left off at the end of Season 5. Ser Davos finds Jon Snow, who is still quite dead. He secures his body and convenes with Dolorous Edd and some other friends of Jon's about what the heck they should do now. Edd is ready to make a stand and sacrifice their lives to get back at Thorne, but Davos has a better plan. Go get the Wildlings, Edd. They should be more than happy to avenge the man who saved them from extinction.Meanwhile, Alliser Thorne establishes his own command with a rousing speech about how it was absolutely necessary to betray Jon in order to save the Night's Watch. I actually quite liked this scene, because it establishes Thorne as a man who does anything for the things he believes in, rather than a vindictive bastard. I can actually see where he's coming from, even if I still want him to die a painful death.In Winterfell, Ramsay has some own mourning to do as he grieves over the loss of Myranda. We see a tiny sparkle of humanity here, until he orders the maester to just feed her body to the dogs. But trouble arrives with Daddy Bolton chastising him for toying with Theon and Sansa, because now they're both gone. And by the way: if Ramsay doesn't find Sansa, he's quickly making himself useless and disposable, especially if Mother Bolton gives birth to a real heir to the North. Whoops indeed.Theon and Sansa are fleeing for their lives, which is quickly taking a toll on poor Sansa. Theon tries to hide her and face the Bolton soldiers himself, but they quickly discard him and pull Sansa out of the bushes. But just when you think everything is lost, Brienne and Pod rush to their aid, completely saving the day. Yes, I know... what a coincidence! But I'll let it pass, because it was absolutely awesome and I love how Sansa has finally found an aid who can actually help her and who is completely loyal to her.Back in King's Landing, Cersei is looking forward to a happy reunion with her daughter Myrcella. But as the witch Maggy the Frog already predicted, her joy will turn to ash in her mouth, as gold is the shroud that covers Myrcella's dead body. Cersei is just about ready to admit defeat to the inevitability of prophecy, but Jaime is still ready to fight. They're the only ones who matter, so f*** prophecy, right? It's a strong moment, but Jaime keeps changing his mind about who to support. Sometimes he's on Cersei's side, sometimes he's working against her. Weird.And yes, Margaery is still in jail, but that scene is boring so I'm going to skip it. Let's move on to Dorne, because oh boy, do I have a Dornish bone to pick!Prince Doran gets the news of Myrcella's sudden and unexpected demise. And right at that moment, all hell breaks lose. Tyene Sand quickly disposes of Areo Hotah, as her mother puts a dagger into Prince Doran.Okay, stop! Isn't Doran supposed to be this genius ruler, who came up with the whole Dornish Masterplan that spans decades? How did he not see this coming? Why are those Sand Snakes still allowed to sneak around Doran, after they got thrown into the dungeon for trying to kill Myrcella in the palace gardens? Do you not have whisperers of your own, Doran? As you say: \"We each have our roles.\" But it looks like your role is just to be absolutely USELESS!Jorah and Daario are still looking for Daenerys. So that's a scene.Daenerys finds herself in a familiar place as a captive of the Dothraki. When she's taken to the Khal, she first tries to impress everyone by saying how she's Daenerys Stormborn, Bearer of Many Titles. But in the end, she does manage to turn some heads when she mentions that she's Khal Drogo's widow. That helps to avoid her getting raped, but that does bring up a new problem. Because all Dothraki widows are supposed to return to Vaes Dothrak to join the dosh khaleen. Yeah, that's kind of a bummer if you plan to take over the world...Arya is back in a familiar place as well: begging on the streets with no one to care two cents about her (literally). She's now blind, after trying to use a forbidden face to kill Meryn Trant. And what's worse: she gets beaten up by that Faceless Man who looks like a girl, who tells her this is what she can expect every day from now on, so maybe it's about time to do something about it!We end the episode back at the Wall, where Davos and his friends are getting ready to fight. Things look pretty grim, but Davos still puts his faith in the Red Woman who may be able to turn things around. Melissandre herself is getting ready for bed and takes off all her clothes. Suddenly we see what she really looks like. And yeah... I can see why you've decided to dress up as Carice van Houten, because you're not exactly Miss Westeros, are you?And so ends the first episode of a new season. It was satisfying to see all familiar faces return to move the story forward. Some scenes were quite boring and didn't really drive the story forward, and the Dornish plot just needs to go away because it's stupid and useless. But all other plots are still great, so I'm a happy Throner :).This time, there's no clear direction from the books, so the showrunners have to lead the way for the story to unfold. But based on what I've seen in this episode, I'm confident they'll pull it off. See you next time!"]}, "52": {"id": "s06e02", "name": "Home", "script": "Surrender by nightfall, or this ends with blood.  We all die today.  We don't need to die, not if we have help.  You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.  We're going to have a baby.  A reckoning will come,  we need the North to face it.  The entire North.  I have a team of men after them.  They won't get far.  Lady Sansa, I will give my life for yours if need be.  Theon disobeyed my orders.  The boy's a fool.  He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.  Karstarks are Northmen.  They won't forgive the killing of their lord.  Stand and fight, blind girl.  See you tomorrow.  We won't be sailing to Westeros any time soon.  They're dragons, Khaleesi, they can never be tamed.  You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood.  He waits for you.  You're the three-eyed raven.   Give him another go, Ned.  That's my father.  And my Uncle Benjen.  Keep your shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell.  They were all so happy.  So were you once.  Stop showing off.  Lyanna!  My Aunt Lyanna.  I've seen her statue in the crypt.  My father never talked about her.  Would you get out of here? We're sparring.  Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?  I don't know.  What about him?  Wylis, come here.  Hodor?  But he's got giant's blood.  And you've got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.  Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.  And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.  Hodor talks?  You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis.  Come along, now. It's no place for you.  Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.  If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable.  Well, he's never going to learn to fight because he's a stable boy.  So leave him be.  It is time to go.  Please, a little longer.  You finally show me something I care about  and then you drag me away.  It is beautiful beneath the sea,  but if you stay too long, you'll drown.  I wasn't drowning. I was home.  Wylis.  Hodor.  I saw you as a boy.  You could talk.  What happened?  Hodor.  Where's Meera?  Hodor.  You shouldn't be here.  It's not safe outside the cave.  It's not safe anywhere.  I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.  - Hodor. - His real name is Wylis.  And he could talk and fight and-- and then--  What's wrong?  The Three-Eyed Raven says there's a war coming.  And we're going to fight it in there?  Brandon Stark needs you.  For what? I sit in there  and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.  He isn't going to stay here forever.  And out there he needs you.  It's time, Ser Davos.  Open the door and the men inside  can rejoin their brothers in peace.  We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs.  Nobody needs to die tonight.  I've never been much of a fighter.  Apologies for what you're about to see.  Come on.  Attack!  Fight, you cowards!  You fucking traitor.  The only traitors here are the ones  who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander's heart.  For thousands of years the Night's Watch  has held Castle Black against the wildlings.  Until you.  Throw them into the cells where they belong.  Took a lot of knives.  I'll have my men get the wood for a fire.  Bodies to burn.  Shh, hey.  Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei,  tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.  All of a sudden she looks my way.  Gives me a little smile like, \"Well?\"  So, all right, you know, I've never been shy  and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out.  She's never seen anything like it.  I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear,  Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch.  Ooh!  She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips.  Well, you all know me.  You know I wouldn't lie about this.  Get out of my way.  King's orders, Your Grace.  What are the king's orders?  He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace,  for your own protection.  You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?  Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's command, I cannot let you pass.  I would like to speak to my son.  He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.  She grew up.  Almost.  Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?  I expect it was Mother.  Your mother wouldn't do that.  Yes, she would.  Are you angry with her?  - Of course not. - Then why didn't you let her come?  She has every right to be here.  They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.  If she had tried--  They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.  Not while I'm here.  Why haven't you gone to see her?  Everything she endured, she did it for you.  Don't you think I know that?  I'm sorry.  But I can't.  Why not?  When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery,  what did I do?  When they paraded her through the streets like a whore,  what did I do?  We all fail sometimes.  The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm.  If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother,  what good am I?  Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.  Your Grace.  Lord Commander.  I want to see my wife.  The gods wait for Queen Margaery  to confess her crimes and seek their mercy.  The king must wait as well.  Go and see your mother, Tommen.  You're a bold man.  On the contrary.  I fear a great deal.  The Father, the Mother,  the Warrior.  Do you know why we use these stones?  To remind us not to fear death.  We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.  You must long for the next life.  In truth, I fear that, too.  You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.  Your sister sought the gods' mercy  and atoned for her sin.  What about my sins?  I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back.  I killed my own cousin.  When the gods judged my brother guilty,  I helped him escape their justice.  What atonement do I deserve?  You would spill blood in this holy place?  Oh, the gods won't mind.  They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.  Go on, then.  I deserve it. We all do.  We are weak, vain creatures.  We live only by the Mother's mercy.  They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.  I don't.  They'd never reach me before you struck.  I've fought against worse odds.  No doubt many of us would fall.  But who are we, hmm?  We have no names, no family.  Every one of us is poor and powerless.  And yet together,  we can overthrow an empire.  Mother.  Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?  Gold.  Good. It was always her color.  I'm sorry for keeping you here.  I shouldn't have, but I was--  I didn't want to lose you again.  I understand.  I'm glad to see you.  I know I should have come sooner.  I wanted to. I was wrong.  It's all right.  No, it isn't.  I should have executed all of them.  I should have pulled down the sept  onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you,  as you would have for me.  You raised me to be strong  and I wasn't.  But I want to be.  Help me.  Always.  If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time.  Meaning no offense.  He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.  I do not make dwarf jokes.  You think them.  So, the fleet. It's been burned.  We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.  Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere.  Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.  Perhaps they can tell us their secret.  The Masters have retaken both cities.  Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers.  What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.  They are not eating.  They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.  Daenerys is the dragon queen.  Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious.  If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?  Dragons do not do well in captivity.  - How do you know this? - That's what I do.  I drink and I know things.  The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros  ranged over hundreds of miles.  Then Daenerys's ancestors  started chaining them up in pens.  A few generations later,  the last dragons were no larger than cats.  They must be unchained or they'll waste away.  Missandei,  how many times were you in the company of these dragons?  - Many times. - And did they ever harm you?  Never.  Dragons are intelligent.  More intelligent than men according to some maesters.  They have affection for their friends  and fury for their enemies.  - I am their friend. - Do they know that?  They will. It's time they had their supper.  I'm friends with your mother.  I'm here to help.  Don't eat the help.  When I was a child,  an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.  I begged him for one of you.  \"It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,\" I told him.  \"It could be little like me.\"  Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.  Then my father told me  the last dragon had died a century ago.  I cried myself to sleep that night.  But here you are.  Next time I have an idea like that,  punch me in the face.  What's your name?  What's your name?  - No one. - I don't believe that.  You don't believe that.  Who are you?  No one.  If a girl says her name,  a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.  A girl has no name.  If a girl says her name,  a man will feed her tonight.  A girl has no name.  If a girl says her name,  a man will give her eyes back.  A girl has no name.  Come.  Leave it.  A girl is not a beggar anymore.  We came upon the bodies on our way here.  Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?  They obviously had help.  I didn't think Lady Sansa killed them all by herself.  Thank you for this report, Lord Karstark.  We know where she's going.  Her brother's at Castle Black.  Ned Stark's last surviving son?  Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.  So was I, Father.  Your hold on the North will never be secure  as long as a Stark can walk through that door.  Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side.  And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves.  With a small force, we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow--  Murder the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?  You'd unite every house in the North against us.  We don't need every house in the North.  The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks  command more soldiers than all the other houses combined.  With their support, none could challenge us.  The Starks lost my house the day King Robb cut off my father's head.  It's time for new blood in the North.  If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog,  you'll be treated as a mad dog.  Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.  My lords.  Lady Walda has given birth.  A boy.  Red-cheeked and healthy.  My congratulations, Lord Bolton.  Congratulations, Father.  I look forward to meeting my new brother.  You'll always be my firstborn.  Thank you for saying that.  It means a great deal to me.  Maester Wolkan,  send ravens to all the northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead.  Poisoned by our enemies.  How did he die?  Poisoned by his enemies.  You're talking to your lord. Use respect.  Forgive me, my lord.  Send for Lady Walda and the baby.  She's resting, my lord.  At once, my lord.  There he is.  Isn't he wonderful?  May I hold him?  Of-- of course.  Little brother.  Lord Bolton sent for us.  Have you seen him?  Of course. Follow me, Mother.  Where is Lord Bolton?  Down!  It's all right. Come on, shh.  It's cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.  Ramsay, where is your father?  Ramsay.  Where is Lord Bolton?  I am Lord Bolton.  Ramsay.  Ramsay, please.  I'll leave Winterfell. I'll go back to the Riverlands.  Please.  Ramsay.  He's your brother.  I prefer being an only child.  I saw her with a man.  I don't think he hurt her.  She didn't want to leave him, he didn't want to leave her.  You don't know which way she went?  I spent three days looking for her.  She disappeared.  How'd she look?  She looked good.  She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.  No, she wouldn't be.  What happened at Winterfell?  I should have gone with you while I had the chance.  It was a difficult choice, my lady.  We've all had to make difficult choices.  We shouldn't be lighting fires.  It's not safe.  He won't stop hunting us.  We just have to make it to Castle Black.  Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us.  Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.  I won't let him.  I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.  And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place.  And the truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.  And the truth about Robb, who I betrayed.  When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.  I don't want to be forgiven.  I can never make amends to your family  for the things I've done.  They'll keep you safer than I ever could.  You're not coming with us?  I would have taken you all the way to the Wall.  I would have died to get you there.  May I take one of the horses?  Where will you go?  Home.  The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.  And the ironborn who held it?  They died fighting to a man.  What is dead may never die.  What is dead may never die.  But they did  and our invasion died with them.  Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.  Then we will take more.  Why? For more pinecones and rocks?  Because I order it.  We can defeat anyone at sea,  but we'll never hold lands and castles  against mainland armies.  Not if our captains defy my orders,  abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.  I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon.  Then where is he?  Where is your kingdom?  We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war.  That war is over.  The last time we provoked them too far,  I watched from that window as they breached our walls  and knocked down our towers.  I lost two brothers that day.  And I lost three sons.  The War of the Five Kings, they call it.  Well, the other four are dead.  When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you want.  But for now, shut your mouth and obey  or I will make another heir who will.  Let me pass.  You fool, move aside for your king.  Haven't I always, brother?  I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.  What is dead may never die.  Has the custom changed since I've been gone?  Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?  You can mock our god without my help.  I don't mock the Drowned God.  I am the Drowned God.  From Oldtown to Qarth,  when men see my sails, they pray.  You're old, brother.  You've had your time.  Now let another rule.  I heard you lost your mind  during a storm on the Jade Sea.  They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.  They did.  And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.  I needed silence.  What kind of an ironborn  loses his senses during a storm?  I am the storm, brother.  The first storm and the last.  And you're in my way.  Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves.  Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh.  Pull his bones down to your depths  to rest beside his ancestors and his children.  What is dead may never die.  I'm going to find out who did this.  I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.  I swear it by the Salt Throne.  The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon,  not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.  My father would have wanted me to rule.  Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear.  Perhaps you'll win.  Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn.  And perhaps not.  Come in.  I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt.  You interrupt nothing.  I assume you know why I'm here.  I will after you tell me.  It's about the Lord Commander.  The former Lord Commander.  Does he have to be?  What are you asking?  Do you know of any magic  that could help him?  Bring him back?  If you want to help him, leave him be.  Can it be done?  There are some with this power.  - How? - I don't know.  Have you seen it done?  I met a man who came back from the dead,  but the priest who did it--  it shouldn't have been possible.  But it was. It could be now.  Not for me.  Not for you?  I saw you drink poison that should have killed you.  I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.  Everything I believed,  the great victory I saw in the flames,  all of it was a lie.  You were right all along.  The Lord never spoke to me.  Fuck him, then.  Fuck all of them.  I'm not a devout man, obviously.  Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.  I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.  I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.  I never had this gift.  Have you ever tried?  Please.", "summary": ["Plot Bran trains with the Three-Eyed Raven. In King's Landing, Jaime advises Tommen. Tyrion demands good news, but has to make his own. At Castle Black, the Night's Watch stands behind Thorne. Ramsay Bolton proposes a plan, and Balon Greyjoy entertains other proposals.  Summary Beyond the Wall Game-of-thrones-season-6-isaac-hempstead-wright Bran watches his father's past.  Bran Stark continues his training under the Three-Eyed Raven at the tree. He is shown a scene from Winterfell, watching his father and uncle Benjen training in the yard as young boys. He also sees his aunt Lyanna, Old Nan, and Ser Rodrik Cassel. He also sees a stableboy that he realizes is a young Hodor - and is surprised that in his youth he was not a lackwit but was intellectually normal and could talk, and his real name is actually \"Wylis\". Though Bran wants to stay, he is dragged out of the vision by the Three-Eyed Raven, who warns him that it is dangerous to stay too long in such visions. Outside the tree, Bran finds Meera Reed, who still appears to be in mourning over her brother's death. Though Meera questions the point of her presence during Bran's training, Leaf states that Bran will need her when he leaves the tree.  At King's Landing In a tavern, a man drunkenly boasts of having taunted Cersei during her walk of atonement to the great amusement of the other patrons. After he finishes his story, he leaves the tavern to urinate against a wall outside. As he is urinating, he is confronted by Ser Gregor Clegane, who kills him by smashing his head against the wall. Ser Gregor returns to Cersei's side following the murder.  Home 07 The High Sparrow and Jaime converse at Myrcella's funeral.  Myrcella's funeral is held at the Great Sept of Baelor but Cersei cannot attend. Tommen has ordered that Cersei be confined to the Red Keep since he is concerned that the Faith Militant will re-arrest her if she steps inside the sept. In the sept, Jaime and Tommen talk about Myrcella and Prince Trystane. Tommen believes that Cersei is to blame for Prince Trystane's death but tells Jaime that he isn't upset with her. Jaime convinces Tommen to go see his mother and apologize to her as the High Sparrow enters the sept. After Tommen leaves, Jaime begins threatening the High Sparrow and asks him why Cersei is being punished for her sins, but he isn't, considering he murdered the king he vowed to protect. As Jaime is about to kill the High Sparrow, the High Sparrow seems to be unafraid to die, which confuses Jaime. The High Sparrow explains that if Jaime chooses to kill him then many of the sparrows will die fighting him, but it wouldn't really matter since they have no names or individual power. He says that they mean nothing individually, but together they can overthrow an empire.  Tommen visits Cersei in the Red Keep and apologizes for not being more assertive during her imprisonment. He regrets letting the High Sparrow lock her away and says that he should have torn the sept down with the High Sparrow inside of it. He tells her that he needs her help in being a strong ruler. Cersei remains uncharacteristically silent throughout the exchange, but when Tommen is done speaking, she embraces him.  In Meereen Game-of-thrones-season-6-conleith-hill Varys and Missandei discuss Daenerys' imprisoned dragons.  Missandei and Grey Worm tell Tyrion that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating ever since Daenerys left. Tyrion explains that dragons do not do well in captivity and they will probably start eating again if they are unchained. He also suggests that dragons are intelligent enough to remember their friends, and that they will probably not harm Missandei if they meet her again, since she spent so much time with them when they were little. Tyrion and Varys go down below the pyramid, with Tyrion advancing into the darkness alone. One of the dragons emerges from the shadows and Tyrion maintains eye contact. When the other emerges, Tyrion puts down his torch and gently advances. To calm them, Tyrion speaks gently, explaining that some say that dragons are more intelligent than humans; he tells that when he was little, his uncle asked him what he wanted for his nameday present, and he asked for a dragon \u2013 not even a large one, just a little one like him. They all laughed, then Tyrion's father told him dragons were extinct, and Tyrion says he cried himself to sleep that night. He now marvels that he gets to see living ones up close. At this point, Tyrion is finally close enough to release the locking pin on the first dragon's collar. The other comes close, then gingerly turns his head to the side so Tyrion can free him as well. The dragons retreat and Tyrion hastily returns to Varys. Tyrion instructs Varys to punch him in the face if he ever suggests doing anything like that again.  In Braavos Home 08 Arya rejoins the Faceless Men.  Still a beggar on the streets, Arya is again approached by the Waif, who asks her name. Arya says she is \"no one\", at which the Waif hits her. The Waif retorts that she doesn't believe that and neither does Arya. She tries to fight back, but the Waif vanishes, replaced with Jaqen H'ghar. He promises that if she says her name, Arya will sleep under a roof that night, that she will eat, and he will restore her eyes. Each time however Arya says she has no name. Satisfied, he tells Arya to follow him, and that she is a beggar no more.  In the North Home 15 Ramsay kills his father.  At Winterfell, Ramsay and Roose discuss with Harald Karstark what to do about Sansa and Jon. After Ramsay suggests storming Castle Black, Roose warns Ramsay that attacking the Night's Watch would turn the entire North against House Bolton, adding that if he does not act more sensibly he will be discarded. Maester Wolkan enters and announces that Roose's wife Walda has given birth to a baby boy. Roose tells Ramsay that he will always be remembered and treated as his firstborn child, but believing that the new son is a threat to his inheritance, Ramsay thanks him for saying so and then stabs his father to death in front of Wolkan. In his position as the new Lord Bolton, Ramsay orders the maester to announce that Roose was poisoned by their enemies, then personally feeds Walda and his half-brother to the hounds.  In the woods, Brienne fills Sansa in on her encounter with Arya, while Sansa is reluctant to talk about her experiences under Ramsay Bolton's tyranny at Winterfell. She admits that she ought to have accepted her help sooner. Theon, wracked with guilt over his betrayal of the Stark family, decides to leave the group and go home instead of joining the Night's Watch. He tells Sansa that Brienne and Pod will do a better job of looking after her, though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to Castle Black if necessary. He asks to take one of the horses with him, and the two embrace.  In the Iron Islands At Pyke, it is a dark and stormy night. Yara Greyjoy reads a letter to King Balon Greyjoy about how the Glovers retook Deepwood Motte and killed all of the Ironborn who held the castle. Yara notes that their invasion is now a definite failure since Deepwood Motte was the last stronghold that the Ironborn held in the North. Balon tells her that they will continue fighting, but Yara argues that invading the North is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands aren't really valuable to the Ironborn because they are so far away from the sea. Balon says that one of the reasons that the invasion wasn't successful was because Yara wasted men when she attempted to rescue Theon, which she says she will not apologize for. Yara continues to try to convince Balon to end the rebellion, saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the North in the first place was because the Northerners were in the south fighting a war, and now that war is over. She reminds Balon that the last time they provoked the Mainlanders too far they were crushed and her two oldest brothers were killed. Balon tells her that when she rules she can be content with their current standing, but for now she needs to obey his commands or he will make another heir who will.  Home 23 Yara and Aeron hold Balon's funeral.  Balon starts walking on the swinging rope bridge that separates two of the towers of Pyke. Through the storm, he sees a man standing on the bridge who is blocking his way. He tells the man to get out of the way, but the man reveals himself to be Balon's younger brother, Euron Greyjoy. Balon tells him that he's surprised that he's still alive, and Euron mocks the Drowned God, telling Balon that he is the Drowned God. Balon inquires about a rumor that Euron lost his senses during a storm and his crew had to tie him to the mast of the ship to prevent him from jumping overboard. Euron doesn't deny the rumor, and explains to Balon that he cut the tongues out of all of his crew members because he wanted silence. Euron then says that Balon is too old to rule and that he's been ruling long enough and it's someone else's turn. Balon tells Euron that he isn't a true Ironborn because he lost his wits during a thunderstorm and tries to stab him, but Euron throws him off the rope bridge to his death.  At Balon's funeral, Yara tells the priest, Aeron Greyjoy, Balon's youngest brother, that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they're still alive. She swears to do this upon the Salt Throne and Aeron explains to her that she isn't the ruler yet, because the law says that the Kingsmoot chooses the next ruler. Yara argues that her father wanted her to rule, but Aeron says that he doesn't make the law.  At the Wall At Castle Black, nightfall has arrived and the band of black brothers loyal to Jon have not yet surrendered. When Davos refuses a final ultimatum from Ser Alliser Thorne by drawing Longclaw while the others draw their swords, the acting Lord Commander orders the door to be battered down with a sledgehammer. Before the mutineers can break in, however, Edd returns with Tormund Giantsbane and an army of wildlings. Though Thorne demands that the watchmen stand and fight, only one of them is stupid enough to try it and is almost immediately cut down by Tormund, enabling an almost bloodless takeover. One archer foolishly looses a crossbow bolt into Wun Wun's back, which only results in the angry giant seizing him from his perch and dashing him against a stone wall before throwing the mangled body at Thorne's feet. The watchmen, seeing this, quickly throw down their arms and surrender. Thorne tries to attack while Olly angrily rushes Tormund with a sword, but Thorne is seized and Tormund easily disarms Olly and pushes him into waiting arms. No wildlings are hurt.  Game-of-thrones-home-kit-harington Jon Snow is resurrected.  Thorne, plus Olly and the officers who mutinied alongside him, are led away to the Ice Cells. Edd brings Tormund to see Jon's corpse; noting the many wounds, Tormund quietly says that he'll have his men start gathering wood for pyres. Davos visits Melisandre, who has donned her normal glamor but is still gripped by a crisis of faith. When he asks her if reviving Jon is possible, she admits to having seen it done, but insists that she cannot do it, having lost faith in the Lord of Light due to the failure of her predictions regarding Stannis Baratheon to come true. After Davos implores her simply to try, she agrees. After washing Jon's wounds clean and burning his hair, she attempts to revive him using murmured High Valyrian incantations, but it seems they have no effect. After a moment, Tormund leaves, and Melisandre offers a final \"please\" in the Common Tongue, but leaves the room, despondent. Edd and finally Davos follow her a moment later. Once the room is empty however, Ghost, who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which Jon was lying, perks up, and Jon suddenly awakens, gasping for air."], "review": ["(Show spoilers) It was largely a good episode. Many of the events felt a bit rushed and crammed, as though the show is impatient to get the big things done (Jon's resurrection, Ramsay's grab for power, Sansa's escape, Ayra's return to her faceless man training.) The lingering on Bran's experience with Winterfell was very nice, and it struck me as one of the few times the show took a pause.It is one thing to expect the resurrection of Jon Snow, but it is another to actually see it. The resurrection was anti-climatic as I've been waiting for this since I read A Dance With Dragons, and of course, last season. I like that it showed that Jon had warged into Ghost. It is the only way that Jon can come back and still be a full human being. I also liked the struggle within Melissandre as she decided to work with resurrecting Jon, even in her state of doubt. It showed that the power of the god worked in her, instead of any tricks on her part. A higher power wants Jon back, and we the viewers are better for that. It was a little underwhelming, but it is possible the show did that deliberately or they just wanted to get it done.Balon Greyjoy: As a book reader, I was expecting Balon Greyjoy to die. I expected to see a faceless man kill him, but it made sense to bring in Euron Greyjoy for the two men to have their confrontation. Balon looked weak next to his brother, so the death was not a big surprise. Euron looks younger than I expected him to be, but he had all the necessary sneers and bravado. Somehow he got on that island and killed Balon Greyjoy without Yara/Asha discovering his presence. I look forward to the Kingsmoot.Ramsay: I always figured that Ramsay would kill his father, but I didn't expect it to happen so soon in the season. Again, it made sense, and if anyone had any tender thoughts for Ramsay, I'm sure they disappeared when he set the dogs loose on his stepmother and his baby brother. The Karstarks who join Stannis in the books will join Ramsay in the show. I am a bit underwhelmed by Ramsay's evilness. I guess I do miss Joffery a bit. This struck me as more plot development to get to the Battle of the Bastards. And how will Walder Frey react when he hears about the death of his daughter?Kings Landing: The Ser Robert Strong business was well done as he killed the peasant man for insulting Cersei. The Jaime business with the High Septon shows that the leader of the Faithful is a very dangerous man. I call him dangerous because I think he actually believes what he is saying: he is not a hypocrite, but he is also aware of his immense power because he can lead so many people. He has a charisma that cannot be bought or intimidated. That was a nice touch when his followers appeared just as Jaime was contemplating killing him or doing something violent. The High Sparrow is going to be a huge problem for the Lannisters.Theon: I was surprised that Theon is considering going back to the Iron Islands, and I suspect it will not go well for him if he does, but he did offer Sansa convincing reasons for staying away from Castle Black as he is ashamed of how he behaved after taking Winterfell. Of course, he doesn't know what has happened to Jon Snow, and I believe Jon would forgive him because he saved Sansa. But Theon is on another arc, and the Winds of Winter released chapters suggest as much as he is with Stannis as his prisoner. Asha is also the prisoner of Stannis. So we may have seen a book spoiler.What else: Cersei still seems remarkably contained for all that she has endured recently. I suspect that will change soon. I see she still is drinking lots of wine. The Arya business was fairly predictable. I figured she would return to the fold after another round with the waif.I liked seeing Tyrion with the dragons, but I really am not interested in Meereen at all. I hope Tyrion becomes a dragon rider--I think it is a strong possibility.It was a decent episode, much better than the one last week. There was no Dorne craziness, and the shocker deaths really weren't all that shocking. I think the high points for me were seeing Bran with Bloodraven as he saw his father as a younger man, along with Lyanna and the younger Hodor, er, Wylis. The other high point, of course, was seeing Jon Snow return. I am positive he warged into Ghost and returned back to his body, once Melissandre's rituals made it safe for him to return.", "Season 6 has picked up at a vengeful, violent speed and it doesn't seem like it's stopping any time soon. Home is a turbulent, well-constructed setup episode for a thrilling season.Spoilers Ahead. Speculation on theories and book events.Beyond The WallBran still can't walk, but his hiatus has gifted with the ability to see visions. And these are some RICH visions! Those who don't read the books will avoid the excessive back stories, but they also miss out on some key characters.Brandon Stark. Lyanna Stark.\u00a0 To get a brief glimpse of these legends for the first time on screen (even just as kids) gave me a little heart flutter of what's the come. With the ending of the episode, I am more than convinced that this season will show the infamous Tower of Joy scene.King's LandingThe most compelling thing about Game of Thrones is it's ability to weave your emotions in such a complex knot that you simply cannot escape. The Lannisters, who were the most despicable people ever to live two seasons ago, have grown into a pitiful collection of the dead and the incestuous. Strong, surprising performance from Tommen in his emotional scene with Cersei. We are reminded that past Cersei's monstrous existence, she is still a vulnerable mother.Jaime vs. The Faith Millitant? Sufficiently teased.MeereenNo Danaerys, but there's plenty of Tyrion one-liners to really drive home how screwed everyone is in Essos. The slavers have taken back the bay, thanks to the Khaleesi's piss poor leadership and chained dragons.The dragon scene was surprisingly anti-climactic, but perhaps that's because book readers were treated to much more. Something tells me that nothing much will happen in Meereen this season, at least until Danaerys comes back.BraavosArya is still stuck in her training montage. Moving on.WinterfellThe Boltons NEVER disappoint. I always knew that the struggle between father and bastard would come, but not this soon! Ramsay's cruelty comes completely out of left field, leaving him as a proprietor of rape, murder, betrayal, treason, and his latest--baby killing.Honestly, I expected the cunning Roose Bolton to have seen this betrayal coming. He was always the mastermind that could tame Ramsay's violent, psychotic actions, but not this time. It is disappointing yet liberating, unleashing a perfectly unrivaled villain out into the game of thrones.Somewhere in the NorthWhat is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger. Looking forward to Theon's return.The Iron IslandsBalon gets his long overdue bridge death. Alas, the War of the Five Kings is over!Euron (Crow's Eye) Greyjoy emerges, but doesn't have a crow's eye?The Kingsmoot is coming. I expect Yara Grejoy to be somehow fused with the essence of Victarion Greyjoy and bid for control of the Iron Islands against her uncle.Castle BlackWe all saw it coming. R+ L = J confirmed.", "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606[Spoilers]I have two main criticisms for this episode:The events in the North (Winterfell, the Wall and maybe even the Pyke) are moving way faster than those in the other regions. The resurrection of Jon Snow was lacking in context.Let me explain this further. At Winterfell, there seems to be a lot going on in the 5 mins. Why have the Karstarks aligned with Ramsay? When Ramsay kills Roose, the Karstark's leader barely flinches an eyelid. While the alliance between Karstarks and the Boltons seemed dubious at best, it seems surprising that they would support Ramsay over Roose. At the Pyke, the introduction of Euron Greyjoy is as confounding. His dialogues were unclear and almost comical with no context. Let's move over to the Wall now. Here are some of the questions which begs answering. Why is Ser Daavos reasoning with Melisandre to revive Jon Snow? He has had minimal interactions with Jon. Yet he is spending his nights guarding Jon's body. Why isn't he going towards Stannis's camp to see if there are any survivors or questioning Melisandre about what's happening there? Not even a single question about Shireen. How has his loyalty shifted from the Baratheons to Jon Snow so quickly?This show was however not without merit. The scene between Bran and Bloodraven was most interesting. This is probably how we are going to see the events at the Tower of Joy. And Tyrion's 'friendship' with the dragons raises interesting questions. This might be the key as to who rides the other dragons. I am glad that the resurrection of Jon Snow is done with. Now we can move to, hopefully,\u00a0 more interesting parts of his arc.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606Well, this episode wasn't so bad either. But a lot of things happening in it were so easy and convenient. The primary goal seems to have been the setup for future episodes, and more importantly, plot advancement by any means necessary.The rest of the review has major spoilers from Season 6, Episode 2.Bran Stark returns with a bang, in what is easily the best scene of the episode. They have switched Bloodravens, but it's still a poor old man caught in the branches of a stubborn shrub. It was Eddard and Benjen sparring in the show version, while it was Lyanna beating Benjen with sticks in the books. For a moment there I thought sideburns was Brandon, wondering why he was so much older, only to realize that it was a young Rodrik Cassel. I like that Lyanna was introduced on horseback, with her brothers groaning at her to not be a showoff. I was shocked to see Hodor there, not just because he was speaking normal words - I always thought he was much younger, in his early twenties perhaps. And they are calling him Willis/Wylis instead of Walder - because, you know, the show watchers might confuse him with Lord Walder Frey. All of this was happening the practice yard of Winterfell, not the godswood - Bran has undergone enough training that he doesn't need a weirwood nearby to see what has happened. This is how we'll get to see the Tower of Joy, I'd expect. The scene ends with Bran saying something that I was personally thinking:You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.King's Landing was... interesting. We see a random peasant drunkenly mocking Cersei while the others around him start to get uncomfortable, and then Robert Strong comes to smash his head in. Cersei is very subdued, quietly resigning to her chambers on hearing that Tommen doesn't want her leaving the Red Keep. In the Great Sept of Baelor, Jaime has a confrontation with the High Sparrow, and comes out of it thoroughly beaten. Tommen has gone over to Cersei now, asking for her help to bring down the sparrows, and it's not going to end well.The other Lannister sibling is hearing about the dragons' hunger strike, and decides to free them. Curiously, the dragons don't eat him - or roast, or even singe him - and they didn't really leave? I'm not exactly sure what happened there. No Dany this week, she's travelling. We get two quick scenes of the Stark sisters, one at Braavos where the blind beggar girl gets a beating once again before the kindly old Jaqen H'ghar takes her back, and one in the north where Theon is saying goodbye to Sansa. When he said home, does he mean Pyke? Or is he going to Winterfell so he can try and kill Ramsay? I think it's the former, because kingsmoot is coming.The introduction of Euron was not that great, and without the terrifying tales about him, his boasts were rather hilarious. The last of the Five Kings to war for Westeros is dead now, and at the end of his funeral it was made clear that there will be a kingsmoot. We know Asha is going to be there, and Euron, and maybe even Theon would reach in time. Perhaps Theon will be given Victarion's task, wouldn't that be a surprise?The most shocking part of the episode was probably what happened at Winterfell. Ramsay commits patricide, step-matricide and half-fratricide without blinking an eye. Of course, I should have seen this coming, and I know quite a few who did, but I was really expecting the reverse - that Roose would recognize the threat and have Ramsay silently killed. Oh well, another main family line has been destroyed. There was a number of reveals before the stabbing though - someone has killed the sixth Bolton soldier that Brienne et al missed, Ramsay was dropping the Umber and the Manderly names, and there is a Karstark son still alive! (I know Harrion didn't die in the books, but still.)Finally, the Wall. We were warned it was going to be bad, though: \"I have never been much of a writer. Apologies for what you're about to see.\" When the attempt on Jon happened in the books, Castle Black was already at chaos, and it's really hard to guess what was going to happen - two factions of the Night's Watch, a large group of wildlings, the Queen's Men, and an angry giant were all there, and I still can't think of what's going to happen there. But the show, though, made it all a joke. I've already written two answers (one, two) about the resurrection being underwhelming, but even before that we saw the chaos die down quietly. Alliser has men breaking down that door, with Davos and the others getting ready for a fight, the wildlings arrive, and then it's over. Alliser is arrested, and I suppose some of the other conspirators would also be thrown into cells until Jon can behead them. Sigh.Overall, this was a very mediocre episode with a lot of missed opportunities and desperate attempts at adding shock value while botching the actual shocks. 6/10.", "Obviously, spoilers inbound (though if you've managed not to get spoiled thus far you deserve some kind of medal).How do I feel about S6E2: Home? 10/10, would gladly watch again. This is easily the best single episode in several seasons. Unlike many GoT episodes, I didn't feel like a single scene was wasted or unimportant. We covered a lot of ground, without feeling rushed or hurried. Each moment was given its due, and boy, were there a lot of moments.The episode started off by retroducing us to Bran, who was excluded from season 5. They quickly established his ability to see the past through the trees and all but confirmed that this is how they will reveal Jon's parentage with the introduction of young Lyanna Stark.The Iron Islands are not my favorite plotline, and I honestly haven't much missed them for the last two seasons. That being said, their scenes were some of the best of the night, particularly the scene with Balon and Euron on the bridge. I had been wondering for some time if Euron and/or Victarion were going to make a show appearance, and this answered that question for me. It's also wonderful to see Yara back, and I cannot wait for the kingsmoot which presumably will occur within a few episodes.We finally got to see Tommen, and he's finally gaining character depth. Essentially, he feels like a powerless coward, and he knows he needs to grow a spine to be an effective king. (Problematically, he thinks his mother is the best one to teach him this).We also got a fun little confrontation between Jaime and the High Sparrow. Jaime's interaction with the High Sparrow presents a nice contrast to Cersei's. Unlike her, most of Jaime's major sins are out in public and well-known already, and he has little to hide (other than his ongoing affair with his sister).Sansa and Theon were oddly touching, and I'm so glad Sansa now knows that she is not, in fact, the only living Stark. Speaking of which, Arya's training is definitely moving quickly enough to satisfy my need for plot development (if perhaps a little too quickly to be believable). Then there was Tyrion and the dragons. Oh, man, this was so good. I really really want Tyrion to end up with a dragon, and the story he told about wanting a dragon as a child just made me want it even more. Seeing him with Viserion and Rhaegal would have been touching if it wasn't also terrifying. I look forward to seeing Tyrion with the dragons again.Let's not forget Winterfell and the Boltons either. Just when you think Ramsay can't get any worse, he kills all of his remaining family. If I had one quibble with this episode, it was that I can't imagine politically-savvy Roose ever getting so close to Ramsay immediately after he gets disinherited without checking him for weapons - and in that regard, I wasn't terribly satisfied with Roose's death. But it did have to happen, and the follow-up with Walda and her son cemented Ramsay as worse than Joffrey for me.And finally...the Wall. Hoo boy. We knew it was coming, everyone has been calling it for months, but seeing it in action was something else. First, Dolorous Edd returned with the wildlings, then Davos persuaded Melisandre to give resurrecting Jon an attempt. I'm a big fan of how they're handling Melisandre this season; unlike prior seasons, she is incredibly vulnerable, her faith shattered. Her vulnerability makes her more accessible and (I feel) more likeable.The ending scene was handled perfectly. Just...perfectly. I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It was completely appropriate that Jon and Ghost be alone when Jon woke. This is the episode I wanted as the season premiere. It got me jazzed up and excited for the show in a way I haven't been for quite some time. I can't wait to see Jon confront his killers next week!Unanswered Questions:For the love of the old gods and the new, WHERE is Petyr Baelish?So, can Rhaegal and Viserion get out now that they're unchained? Because that could be interesting.Where is Sam? I find it odd that we haven't seen GRRM's analog yet, given how many other plots we've touched on.Is Dorne just going to be written off and ignored now? (Please say yes. I can't take it anymore).Originally appeared on my blog", "SPOILERs ALERT!\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 For the fans who believes in their fan theory of Jon's resurrection!\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 - Because they make happen it so ealry in season 6.NorthJon Snow\u2019s resurrection may have been the big reveal of tonight\u2019s episode, \u201cHome\u201d [coming for Jon Snow] but there was a many more going on in the episode.Jon Snow (Credit: HBO)The Red Priestess tries her best to resurrect the Jon Snow from dead, at the behest of Davos. She thinks she\u2019s failed. They all think she\u2019s failed. But then, as Davos leaves the room, we see Ghost stir. He senses something, just like I knew he would. Why else would they keep showing him sleeping beneath Jon\u2019s pallid corpse? Then, with a gasp, Jon Snow\u2019s dark eyes open.\u00a0 We were right all along. Jon was dead, but he\u2019s alive again.North of the Wall, Bran Stark has visions of his father and uncles and his aunt Lyanna as children play-fighting in Winterfell. Hodor is there, though they call him Willas, and he can speak in words other than \u201cHodor.\u201d Curiouser and curiouser. I have to say, it\u2019s no accident we see young Ned and Lyanna the same episode Jon Snow is brought back from the dead.Meera, for her part, seems jaded and restless, but the Child of the Forest assures her that Bran will need her. \u201cHe won\u2019t be in there forever,\u201d she tells the girl.Bran talks briefly with the Three-Eyed Raven and Meera, but not a lot happens here.And there we have the title of the episode. Now that we have it, let\u2019s not tarry any longer. The White Walkers are about. Let\u2019s fly south :D :D WinterfellBut before we go inside the castle, let\u2019s listen in on these travelers we spy from above. One is a lady knight, too tall and broad to be a proper lady, with a shock of short, blond hair. Brienne and Sansa talk briefly about where to go, and Brienne asks Sansa what happened to her while in Winterfell. Sansa says she should have gone with Brienne when she had the chance, but Brienne is gracious. \u201cIt was a very hard decision,\u201d she says. They speak of Arya before Sansa goes to check on Theon.Poor Theon, he\u2019s a wreck still. He can\u2019t go to Castle Black because Jon will surely kill him for his crimes against the Starks. \u201cI won\u2019t let him,\u201d Sansa says. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.\u201d But Theon doesn\u2019t want to go, doesn\u2019t even want to be forgiven. What of the other truths? What about the farm boys he killed? What about his betrayal of Robb? No, Theon will ride West to the Iron Islands. We\u2019ll go there, too, but first the castle.Here, Roose Bolton speaks condescendingly to his crazy bastard son, Ramsay. Ramsay wants to attack Castle Black and kill Jon (who he doesn\u2019t know is dead\u2026or, uh, alive again I guess.) Roose says that if you act like a mad dog, you\u2019ll be treated like one. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed. Torrhen Karstark stands nearby, ready to pledge his sword to eliminating the Starks since Robb beheaded his father.And just at that moment, in walks the Maester with news that Lady Walda has had a baby boy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll always be my firstborn,\u201d Roose says to Ramsay. \u201cThank you father,\u201d Ramsay replies. \u201cThat means so much to me.\u201dThen he stabs him to death. Some commenters said last week they thought Ramsay would kill his father. I thought it was too easy a play. Roose is clever, would always expect such a betrayal, and would be prepared to turn the tables on his bastard. He\u2019s played everyone else like a fiddle, why not Ramsay, too? This is where my predictive powers took a nose-dive, I suppose. Roose is dead, \u201cpoisoned by our enemies\u201d according to Ramsay.The following scene\u2026poor Fat Walda. Her poor baby. Ramsay is a cruel prick, that\u2019s for sure. I can\u2019t wait for Jon Snow (or maybe Sansa Stark?) to put a sword through his eye. Joffrey may have deserved a poison goblet; Ramsay deserves a blade.The Iron IslandsHere Yara and Balon Greyjoy are arguing the merits of invading the mainland. She\u2019s against such a foolish, pompous venture. He\u2019s the last of the five clashing kings, and thinks that in and of itself is victory enough\u2014a sign to keep on fighting for no good reason. Yara reminds him that the last time they tried this, Ned Stark knocked down his castle, killed two of his sons, and took Theon hostage.Balon storms out, walking out into the rain on the most frightening looking rope bridge I can imagine walking across in the middle of a storm. A shadowy figure stands on the other side. It\u2019s Euron Greyjoy, Balon\u2019s little brother. Euron is insane and cruel and arrogant, and says it\u2019s his time to rule and Balon is in his way. Naturally, he throws him from the bridge into the rocky sea below.They send Balon\u2019s body out to sea, and Yara swears she\u2019ll exact vengeance on whoever killed him. The priest reminds her that she isn\u2019t the ruler, that this will be decided at the kingsmoot, where the Iron Islanders pick their next ruler. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be the first woman to rule the Iron Islands,\u201d he tells her, doubt in his voice. Euron may have a thing or two to say on the matter, in any case.If we keep flying we can leave the dreary islands behind us, and head to wear it\u2019s warm. It\u2019s just a bit south by south-east this time, and there\u2026the red keep is off in the distance.King\u2019s LandingHere, the Lannisters are trying their best to regain a footing in the tumultuous capital. The Sparrows are still exerting far too much control, but there seems to be little anyone can do about it. At best, Cersei is exacting a petty sort of vengeance on the people who mocked her in the streets. The guy who flashed her is boasting about it in his cups. He goes to relieve himself and Cersei\u2019s zombie knight, the resurrected Gregor Clegane, smashes his head into the wall. The violence is almost comical.Jaime and the High Sparrow have it out in the High Sept, over the body of Myrcella. The High Sparrow really is a cocky little man, and I think far too self-assured. He reminds Jaime that his people have nothing to lose. No wealth, no families, no names, and yet together they can \u201coverthrow an empire.\u201d Sure, the man deserves credit for making some pretty savvy moves against Cersei and Tommen. But Cersei is a terrible leader and Tommen is a boy. Notice, the High Sparrow didn\u2019t make any plays against Tywin Lannister when he was alive and Joffrey was king, nor against Robert. He\u2019s slithered in during a time of chaos and made some very good political power plays.Will Jaime be duped as easily? If nothing else, I think Jaime will be a great deal more bold than Tommen. And if he musters the Lannisters and the forces of King\u2019s Landing, he should very easily wipe the Sparrows from the map.Let\u2019s leave the Seven Kingdoms altogether, spreading our black wings out above Blackwater Bay, heading east and north across the Narrow Sea, until the spires of the free city of Braavos come into view beneath the clouds.BraavosHere, Arya Stark tells the man we know as Jaqen H\u2019ghar three times that \u201ca girl has no name\u201d even as he tempts her with food, shelter, and her sight. \u201cCome, follow me,\u201d he tells her, instructing her to leave her beggar\u2019s dish. \u201cA girl is not a beggar,\u201d he says. Thank goodness we don\u2019t have to see Arya get beat up again by that other girl, who seems to take the whole thing far too personally to be \u201ca girl with no name\u201d herself.MeereenVarys and Missandei (Credit: HBO)Here, Tyrion reminds Varys and the others that dragons cannot survive captivity. Dany\u2019s ancestors rode on dragons accustomed to ranging for hundreds of miles. They conquered Westeros with those dragons. But their descendants chained up their dragons, until they were no bigger than cats. Until they went extinct.So, perhaps because he is well into his drink, Tyrion ventures down into the vast dungeon hall where Daenerys has chained two of her dragons, Rhaegel and Viserion, and frees them. They\u2019re intelligent creatures, he reasons, and they\u2019ll realize he\u2019s their friend. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d asks Missandei. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do,\u201d Tyrion replies. \u201cI drink and I know things.\u201dSo, torch in hand, he reaches out to the two captive dragons.\u201cI\u2019m here to help,\u201d he tells them. \u201cDon\u2019t eat the help.\u201dHe also tells them how he wanted a dragon of his own, and cried himself to sleep when he discovered they were all dead. \u201cAnd yet here you are,\u201d he says.It\u2019s a great, tense moment. I didn\u2019t really think the dragons would eat Tyrion\u2014even for a show used to giving us big, shocking deaths, this would be a bit much\u2014but it\u2019s still scary. When Tyrion rushes away up the stairs, Varys looks at him with a look of shock. It\u2019s quite the expression coming from the usually cool and collected Spider, whose typical emotional range runs between smug and faux concern.Good for Tyrion to free the dragons, though we don\u2019t yet know how they get out of the palace or what happens next.Let\u2019s skip flying and just fast-travel back to\u2026Castle BlackDavos is really the central hero here. In the beginning of the episode, he and his companions and Ghost ready themselves to fight against the vile Alliser Thorne. Just when all seems lost, Eddison Tollett shows up with the Wildlings, led by Tormund Giantsbane. One giant smashing a Crow against the wall and tossing his broken body aside convinces the rest of the Night\u2019s Watch to lay down their arms. Alliser is arrested and the good guys, for once, triumph over the villains.This is the second piece of good news in Season 6, following the rescue of Theon and Sansa by Brienne of Tarth last week. But it\u2019s not the last.Once again, it\u2019s Davos who comes to the rescue. He champions the idea of bringing Jon Snow back from the dead to Melisandre, who has lost faith in her Lord of Light. If he hadn\u2019t been there, she wouldn\u2019t have bothered, and they would have burnt his body beyond all revival.VerdictI\u2019m still sort of processing this episode, to be honest, though I found it gripping and intense for the most part. Jon Snow coming back in the second episode is amazing!Ramsay killing Roose Bolton was also pretty intense, and opens the door for all sorts of madness in the North. Big, scary things are afoot.And I loved the scene between Tyrion and the dragons\u2014especially since it has implications beyond the dragons simply being intelligent. Did they favor Tyrion for other reasons? What it might be as this Jon Snow's resurrection by Red Priestess fan theory came true like that another fan theory that says, \"Tyrion Lannister could be a Targaryen.\"?There\u2019s plenty of time for speculation before next week\u2019s episode. For now, I'm keeping fingers crossed... Thanks for A2A Monu Kamble ", "I thought it was a lot better than the last episode. The scenes had a lot more meat to them and there was nothing really terrible. I found it to be much better written. I didn't recognize the writer's name: he must be new.I have two nitpicks: the obviousness of the Sansa storyline: it's clear that my prediction that Ramsay will recapture Sansa, who will be the 'bait' for Jon Snow to come rescue her. Quite aside from the most Un-GRRM like plot turning that represents, I just wish their foreshadowing wasn't always so heavy handed.The other scene I had a problem with was Arya's. How did that even make sense? I saw no evidence of any test being passed, yet Arya evidently passed it. Tyrion freed the dragons, as everyone predicted. A lot of fuel has been put on the fire of the \"Tyrion as dragon-rider\" theory. Some people will be upset, but in fact, most fans have long believed that to be an eventuality.(But are dragons really smarter than humans?)Winterfell scenes were very well-done, I thought. By far the best acting that Ramsay-actor has been allowed. Of course it was horrid, but we all knew it was going to happen. I was a bit disappointed at Roose Bolton's going out with a whimper. Evidently, Roose Bolton is a man to be undone. King's Landing was great. I mean, I hate what they've done to book Cersei, of course. But they sold it to me. There were a lot of moments of genuine dramatic tension that they managed to solve without a stupid death. Kudos. They are growing.Jon Snow: My main quibble is about Davos being there in the first place. It's hard to find his motivations, pecially after the Wildling cavalry has rescued him. And the eventual reawakening was, well, a bit cheesy because it was more-or-less expected. I mean the execution of it. The long lingering shot and the wakening gasp. I'll give it a 4/5 for TV. It ain't the books, but it's good enough that I can temporarily forget about them and accept it as a newer and dumber, though still entertaining story.", "The second episode takes up the arduous task of keeping the story going as it brings back older plot lines. Game of thrones is back and it is back to killing people and bringing others back?Bran Stark is still training as he visits the early days of his fathers childhood as we are introduced to Lyanna Stark for the first time in the series. The scene is cut short as Bran tries to explain the usefulness of the cave exploration to Meera who is still grieving from her brothers death. Kings Landing is still reeling from the walk of shame as they prepare to honour Myrcella. Tommen feels guilty for being incompetent during the events that have transpired across the Kingdom as both his wife and Mother are imprisoned. We get glimpses of the monstrosity of a reanimated mountain as he bashes the skull of a man into the wall. Jaime is ready to die to keep his word as he finally confronts the man who is set out to take down his family. Has he said too much? Ramsay Bolton is dangerous as ever. His failures have piled up as he let Sansa and Theon get away. Wada Frey has a baby and it is a boy. Rose Bolton reassures Ramsay that he would always be his first born. Ramsay isn\u2019t happy after the threat from last week. He doesn\u2019t leave\u00a0 anything to chance as he wipes out the rest of the Bolton line to become the Warden of the North. He is headed to Winterfell to take on Jon Snow and claim the North for himself. Sansa and the gang are on their way to the Wall. Theon isn\u2019t happy with going to the Wall. He knows Jon Snow will kill him for the betrayal. He embarks on a journey back to home the Iron Islands after giving a heartfelt speech about how he\u2019ll always be loyal to the Starks.Mereen has grown impatient under Tyrion and Varys as they wait for their Queen to return. The other nearby lands that Dany freed are back to normality as the slaves are returned to the slave owners. Tyrion frees the dragons to ensure that they live till the Queen gets back and also to satisfy his own curiosity. He is able to free them without causing much damage. The show has done a great job of replacing Quentyn with Tyrion in this aspect. I expected Tyrion to die, but I guess the show runners know what the fans want. As Theon begins his journey back to his home, we go back to the Iron Islands. Balon Greyjoy is old and disheveled. He isn\u2019t sure about what to do with his Kingdom next as he isn\u2019t quite hopeful for any of his heirs. He meets his long estranged brother the Crows Eye on the bridge after which he plummets to his death. The show has done a great job of introducing 3 of the 4 brothers as the Iron Islands prepare for the Kings Moot. Melissandre the Barber, gives the dead Jon Snow a good haircut. Ser Davos gets her going with a good pep talk. He is probably frustrated with the number of murders she has committed in the name of sacrifice without any results. After a dramatic chanting to get him back from the dead Melissandre gives up only for a dramatic ending with Jon Snow waking up. ", "As there are several summaries floating around of this episode, I shan't delve into it and just present my views on how this episode shaped up. Resurrection of Jon. Seriously, HBO?! Of all the lovely ideas floating around, including some brilliant stuff speculated by fans, you have an atheist Ser Davos pep-talk Melisandre into trying to resurrect Jon. So uncharacteristic and totally anti-climactic. I knew this was pretty much coming, as HBO wouldn't pay all that money to Kit Harrington just so that he can play dead half a season. An episode or two is all they can afford. And there you have it. Dragon Whisperer Tyrion. Well, well, well. The line should've been \"I drink, I know things and I can whisper sweet nothings into vicious and captive dragons without being turned into toast\". This entire sequence was bloody awesome. Especially how the second dragon offers to have himself unshackled by Tyrion. Without even growling. Well done, dragons! Time travelling Bran. This was a revelation in more ways than one, and left me wanting more just like Bran. Young Ned, Benjen and the fiery Lyanna. Wow! However, the surprise bit was a perfectly coherent Hodor/Willas. I didn't peg him to be that old, really. And\u00a0 it does throw up interesting questions as to what made him lose his speech and why does he say \"Hodor\"? Does it mean anything specific? I think Hodor has a bigger role to play than just being Bran-carrier.Ramsay Bolton. Enough said. Roose Bolton deserved to die if he couldn't see his bastard for what he truly is. The Lady Walda, her newborn and the dogs stuff was unnecessary. We already know how terrible Ramsay Bolton is, there's no need to prove anything more. The sequence should've ended with Lady Walda wanting to see \"Lord Bolton\". Turmoil in Pyke. This seemed like a half-a**ed attempt to bring the Greyjoy story arc that's there in the books into the series. The Kingsmoot, and the happenings thereat, are very interesting and in my opinion should've been shown in Season 4/5. Having said that, I am eager to see the Dragon Horn that gets blown at the Kingsmoot and how and if it gets incorporated in the series. Lannisters, Arya, Brienne, Sansa, were really quite boring. Especially Arya. Hopefully she gets her sight back in the next episode. It would be great if they can show her warging into a cat before she gets her vision back just like in the books. All in all a mixed bag of an episode. It would be quite interesting to see how things pick up from this episode in the next one.", "The episodes are getting more and more predictable. They have had to really simplify parts of the books (the Dorne plot, no war/plague/siege in Meereen, no Victorian)I was not a fan of how they made Bloodraven just look like a regular old Watch member or how the Children now look. Also using the 'time machine' plot device with Bran is weak story telling. Its what shows do when they run out of ideas.Ser Davos wasn't really given a real motive to ask Melisandre to resurrect Jon. He's not religious and prior to this season did not even like Melisandre.\u00a0 Didn't he even try to kill her at one point because of her necromancy? Melisandre's character has been made a shell of her former self. I think it would have been better to make her realize she interpreted the visions incorrectly and gone to Davos with the revelation and try to bring Jon back while Davos protested instead of what they did.Ramsay's plot wasn't even veiled it was basically told in the last episode.\u00a0 One question I have is what is the gift going to be for Ramsay?\u00a0 Will they work a fake Sansa into the plot now? Or bring back Stannis? Or will it be a Rickon hostage?They telegraphed that Sand Snakes are still lurking in Kings Landing, so Tommen's golden shroud is incoming after Cersei gets him to start a war with the Faith Militant.The rest seemed pretty standard.The best scenes are the giant rag-dolling the guy that shot him (which is basically what made Thorne and his men surrender, even though they probably would have pin-cushioned the giant as soon as he broke the doors) and Tyrion with the dragons, which I know many people will take to mean Tyrion is a Targaryen, when its clear he isn't he just treated the dragons like the intelligent creatures they are.", "[This review contains spoilers and speculation]Hodor? Hodor.The show gives us only its second flashback ever, this time in the form of a pensieve-like vision that Bran witnesses. By showing us Ned, Benjen and Lyanna, the show presumably lays the groundwork for a big reveal in later episodes but also serves up an awesome surprise right there -- once upon a time, Hodor could do more than just Hodor.You can't help but sympathize with Meera though. She's left her childhood home, braved the bitter cold, narrowly escaped being raped and seen her brother get stabbed to death, all so Bran could chill with the Bloodraven and daydream about the past.Breaker of Chains 2.0Having seen his ships burn away in the last episode, Tyrion realizes that he needs to fight fire with fire. Thankfully for him, Dany's dragons seem to have made full use of the dungeons' distance learning courses, and added the common tongue to the repertoire of languages that they can comprehend.Grateful for being freed, the dragons will no doubt help Tyrion regain control over Meereen, but the true potential of this blossoming friendship might only be realized once the trio crosses the narrow sea.Help me!After a brief period of rebellion last season against his Queen mother, Tommen relapses into his helpless child mode. The fact that his decision to deny Cersei the chance to attend her daughter's funeral was made out of concern and not spite, was a nice touch that shows little Tommen still loves (and needs) his mother.The High Sparrow's interaction with Jaime betrays his pernicious nature. Jaime's reasoning is foolproof -- if the Sparrow could humiliate his sister for her sins, why should he be spared? But what Jaime fails to see is that the High Sparrow is playing a long game. If things go as per his plan, Jaime will get his comeuppance too; just not right now.Over in Braavos and in much need of help herself, a girl with no name (psst, Arya) continues to get whipped, before passing the easiest test in the world and getting re-accepted into the House of Black and White.The dastardly bastardFor the second episode running, Thrones serves up a murder that I didn't see coming at all as Ramsay does to Papa Bolton what the latter did to Rob Stark. The murders of Doran Martell and Roose were particularly shocking because, like a lot of fans, I was expecting both to be central characters this season.But now that mad dog Ramsay has nullified all threats to his claim and is free to rule unchecked, it stands to reason that a lot more blood will be spilled before the season is over. And given the events at the end of the episode and his decision to raid the Wall, I suspect some of it will be his own.Balon's will is mootThe episode introduces Euron Greyjoy, Balon's younger brother, who promptly makes a case for safer bridges in Westeros. Balon thinks that Euron's years at sea have left him half-insane, and with the dialogue Euron was given to work with this episode, we might as well believe him.His arrival at the Iron Islands however complicates matters for Yara who will now have to ward off competition for the Salt Throne in a quasi-election, the Kingsmoot. But with brother Theon's impending homecoming presenting her with another ally (remember, she was pretty popular amongst the Ironborn), her chances of victory look good.Be prepared for Euron to play spoilsport however. It would be unlikely that the show introduces him at this juncture only to have him drift off into insignificance soon after.Lord of the Wall: Return of the NescientOver at the Wall, the real traitors of the Night's Watch are imprisoned by the returning Free Folk, which lets the focus for Davos and team shift beyond immediate damage control. After some textbook vacillating, the Red Woman accedes to Ser Davos' wishes and relieves Kit Harington of his contractual obligation to not shear his curly locks.Despite the fact that we all knew that Jon Snow had to come back, it is to Thrones' credit that it still manages to seed the slightest doubt in our minds about whether he would. The actual revival however wasn't quite the cinematic event that it could have been (but then again, given the expectations of fans following a major death, when is it ever? See: Sherlock S03E01) as having been exposed to Grandmalisandre in the previous episode, I expected her \"true form\" to play a role in Jon's resurrection.But anyway, enough quibbles. Jon is back! And hopefully this time around, he knows something.", "Liked it. Liked it a lot.I know some people are complaining about the means of Jon Snow's resurrection but I'm a bit unclear about what they actually wanted to occur. He's back and the implications are what's important now because it's not just about the return of Jon Snow, it's the return of The Red Woman and her change of allegiance. In the past she's been a true zealot, convinced of her own power and her own abilities and her own vision. Then for two episodes we saw all that stripped away and discovered she was just a sad old woman with a fire fixation. But now, she's bringing people back from the dead and her convictions can all be conveniently retconned. \"All praise the Lord of Light. He led me to believe Stannis was the chosen king so my faith would be tested and he would lead me to the true King\". She's going to go full nutcase and Jon is in her debt. This episode also promised to move forward two of the storylines that have become a bit bogged down in recent times. Arya might finally get somewhere and Mereen could become interesting again. Game of Thrones has always been at it's best when it builds up conflict and then lets it loose. And it's shown it can do large scale conflict better than any show on TV and better than most movies. This episode laid further groundwork for more conflict on the horizon. Internal conflict for the Greyjoys, conflict between Ramsay and anyone who isn't Ramsay, conflict between the Lannisters and the high sparrow, conflict between the Lannisters and Dorne, further White Walker conflict with the newly resurrected Lord Commander back in charge, conflict between the Mountain and anyone guilty of indecent exposure, conflict between dragons and anyone in Mereen silly enough not to get out of the way...Hang on, it's going to get bloody. ", "It was yet another Monday morning when I lay on my bed, my back to it, legs and hands splayed like a snow fair. First, my dog woke up in the silence of of the morning. Then, I opened my eyes and drew a long breath. Rolling in my bedsheet, I switched on my laptop with half ditsy eyes and somehow managed to fish out a decent 280 MB\u00a0 torrent which would(atleast in my opinion) get downloaded in a decent time.Let me be honest here. I DIDN'T see the entire episode. I just scrolled towards the very end.The end when we see a furrowed Melisandre, crumbling under the expectations of millions of fans and few crows, that hapless look on her face which speaks i-do-this-or-i'm-fucked. And that silence that engulfs you when Davos walks out of the room housing Jon's naked body, his back to it, limbs splayed on a hard,wooden bed and none but ghost by his side. We see the camera zoom on his face. We anticipate and we KNOW what's about to happen but we wait, the final few seconds of the episode.Anything can happen.Then, all of a sudden, we see Ghost stir up. Our first thought is of Jon warging back as Ghost. Although we are happy, but happy isn't what we had expected.And then it happens.The Lord Commander opens his eyes, inhales the air equivalent to the breath all his fans have been holding for a year and comes back....There was a surreptitious trickle in my eyes which gave in to a burst of ecstatic applause, startling my roommates and scaring my neighbors!Whew! I've NEVER experienced such an adrenaline rush in my life.I guess this is some story I can narrate to my descents a few years down the lane.\"Grandpa! Do you know Jon comes back?\"\"I saw it live when this happen, my child. I know.\"Valar Morghullis!Edit: The complete review coming very soon.", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Spoilers!!Another stunning episode. Scene after scene of nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat drama. The sets, the script, the acting, the story-telling: wonderful. Incredibly entertaining. Bran/Bloodraven \u2013 for book fans, Bran and his mentor giving us a visual wander-through of interesting scenes from Westerosi history is mouth-watering. An actual visual on Lyanna Stark is a huge deal. Watch THAT space. The Hodor-could-talk development was unexpected. What significance this will have? Amazingly elaborate set of Winterfell\u2019s interior. Such attention to detail. God, I love the fact they are spending so much money on this show.The Wall/TheWildlings \u2013 Top-quality action scene. Great moment when the giant whips the crossbowman off the wall, smashes him against the stones, then flings his lifeless body on the ground. Ser Alliser\u2019s anti-Jon revolution didn\u2019t even last two episodes. The good guys are in charge of Castle Black again.FrankenGregor/Tommen/Cersie\u2013 Great novel-death-method moment from FrankenGregor, who nicely sets out his stall for the season (i.e. killing people in unusual and imaginative ways). Tommen\u2019s scene with Cersie is his best of the show so far. Really powerful. Asking Cersie to show him how to rule is unlikely to lead to good outcomes. If he wants to be strong, he should jolly well rescue his wife from those religious fanatics.Jamie/The HighSparrow \u2013 Scintillating dialog between these two. I was hanging on every word. Jonathan Pryce is made for Game of Thrones. He\u2019s now verbally seen of both Diana Rigg and the Kingslayer himself. Will no one stop this man?\u00a0 I have absolutely no idea where this plot line is going, or what it means. Finding out promises entertainment.Tyrion/Mereeen/Dragons\u2013 First: \u201cThat\u2019s what I do: I drink and I know things.\u201d Goes down as one of Tyrion\u2019s best ever lines (and it\u2019s up against some seriously stiff competition). Second: Mereen with Tyrion in it is much more interesting the Mereen without Tyrion. Third: unbelievable work to downing glass after glass of booze, then deciding to go and check out the starving dragons chained in the basement of your pyramid. Possibly the best seems-like-a-good-idea-when-you\u2019re-drunk plan ever.The scene with the dragons was simply outstanding. For the first time, someone is actually attempting to productively interact with the adult dragons. I loved the moment when Viserion immediately understands what Tyrion has done on releasing his sibling\u2019s chain, and at once presenting his own neck. These dragons are smart. Real smart. And this is the scene when they got really interesting. I hope they friends with Tyrion. And I hope he ends up riding the white one.Viserion and Rhaegal are significantly bigger than they were when they ripped apart that dude in Season 5. I\u2019d day they were as big as Drogon was last season. So when we next see Drogon \u2026 Roose/Ramsey/the Dogs\u2013 Given Ramsey is such a naked psychopath; I\u2019d always assumed Roose had some contingency against his mental son just stabbing him through the heart. It seems the North\u2019s most experienced strategist overlooked that eventuality, even though the rest of us assumed Ramsey would try something like that at some point. Both this and last week\u2019s Bolton episodes were engrossing. Shame to see the back of Michael McElhatton, who was brilliantly cast and always a pleasure to watch.Once Roose was dead, Walda had zero chance of survival. The build-up to the kennel scene was very well done and exceptionally creepy (one of the most disturbing things is how charismatic Ramsay manages to be). As for the kennel scene itself: we wondered what Game of Thrones was going to do to top burning to death a sympathetic child character in front of her parents. Well, now we know. One wonders how they\u2019ll top a mother and baby being ripped apart by hounds. Something tells me they will.Balon/Yara/Euron \u2013Back to the Iron Islands after a long break. Balon Greyjoy\u2019s invasion of the north has proven a damp squid. To his daughter\u2019s frustration he has no more imaginative plan to offer. Time to die, old man.I was full of anticipation of the entrance of Euron Greyjoy: the one-eyed lunatic pirate captain who leads his elite band of killers around the world, raping and pillaging as they go \u2013 the guy mad enough to brave the ruins of Valyria and survive, and the guy who makes Ramsey look like a misunderstood but fundamentally gentle soul. Given the brilliance a scene (storm, swaying rope bridge,massive drop) I expecting quite a lot. I\u2019m afraid on the evidence of this one scene, the part seems miscast.Judgement will be reserved until the Kingsmoot \u2013 which should be one of the most interesting scene\u2019s in this Series.Jon Snow revisited \u2013That was shocking. Despite being absolutely sure Jon would come back from the dead this series, this was not how I expected it to happen. The sheer simplicity caught me off guard (Melisandre performs a ritual; Jon rises from the dead). Surely - I assumed while watching the scene \u2013 this will be a false run, and Jon will be brought back some other way? This show is moving too fast for false runs.It was another splendid, emotional scene. Melisandre\u2019s methodical washing of the corpse; chanting in her unknown language; the trepidation-filled looks between Tormund and Davos; the shots of Jon\u2019s dead body; the shocking resurrection itself.Reflections on Jon\u2019s return \u2013 I was really hoping to see was some sort plotted underworld sequence. Mainly because, as an old-school fantasy geek, what I\u2019d love a reveal about George R R Martin\u2019s metaphysics (Life after death? What\u2019s there? How does it work?). It does not look like we\u2019ll get that in the show.But presumably, John has brought some boon back from the dead with him? Of knowledge, possibly? Jon\u2019s death must have narrative significance,given it appears to be a such central plot point. Maybe Jon will reflect upon the experience of being dead, and hearing about will be spookier and more satisfying than seeing it?I have a lot of faith in the source material, and in D&D\u2019s adaptation of it. So I expect what we learn from Jon\u2019s death and subsequent resurrection\u2013 and the effect it has on both the character and the story \u2013 will be at least as interesting and satisfying as anything I could have thought up.Bring it on.", "Obviously, spoilers inbound (though if you've managed not to get spoiled thus far you deserve some kind of medal).How do I feel about S6E2: Home? 10/10, would gladly watch again.This is easily the best single episode in several seasons. Unlike many GoT episodes, I didn't feel like a single scene was wasted or unimportant. We covered a lot of ground, without feeling rushed or hurried. Each moment was given its due, and boy, were there a lot of moments.The episode started off by retroducing us to Bran, who was excluded from season 5. They quickly established his ability to see the past through the trees and all but confirmed that this is how they will reveal Jon's parentage with the introduction of young Lyanna Stark.The Iron Islands are not my favorite plotline, and I honestly haven't much missed them for the last two seasons. That being said, their scenes were some of the best of the night, particularly the scene with Balon and Euron on the bridge. I had been wondering for some time if Euron and/or Victarion were going to make a show appearance, and this answered that question for me. It's also wonderful to see Yara back, and I cannot wait for the kingsmoot which presumably will occur within a few episodes.We finally got to see Tommen, and he's finally gaining character depth. Essentially, he feels like a powerless coward, and he knows he needs to grow a spine to be an effective king. (Problematically, he thinks his mother is the best one to teach him this).We also got a fun little confrontation between Jaime and the High Sparrow. Jaime's interaction with the High Sparrow presents a nice contrast to Cersei's. Unlike her, most of Jaime's major sins are out in public and well-known already, and he has little to hide (other than his ongoing affair with his sister).Sansa and Theon were oddly touching, and I'm so glad Sansa now knows that she is not, in fact, the only living Stark. Speaking of which, Arya's training is definitely moving quickly enough to satisfy my need for plot development (if perhaps a little too quickly to be believable).Then there was Tyrion and the dragons. Oh, man, this was so good. I really really want Tyrion to end up with a dragon, and the story he told about wanting a dragon as a child just made me want it even more. Seeing him with Viserion and Rhaegal would have been touching if it wasn't also terrifying. I look forward to seeing Tyrion with the dragons again.Let's not forget Winterfell and the Boltons either. Just when you think Ramsay can't get any worse, he kills all of his remaining family. If I had one quibble with this episode, it was that I can't imagine politically-savvy Roose ever getting so close to Ramsay immediately after he gets disinherited without checking him for weapons - and in that regard, I wasn't terribly satisfied with Roose's death. But it did have to happen, and the follow-up with Walda and her son cemented Ramsay as worse than Joffrey for me.And finally...the Wall. Hoo boy. We knew it was coming, everyone has been calling it for months, but seeing it in action was something else. First, Dolorous Edd returned with the wildlings, then Davos persuaded Melisandre to give resurrecting Jon an attempt. I'm a big fan of how they're handling Melisandre this season; unlike prior seasons, she is incredibly vulnerable, her faith shattered. Her vulnerability makes her more accessible and (I feel) more likeable.The ending scene was handled perfectly. Just...perfectly. I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It was completely appropriate that Jon and Ghost be alone when Jon woke.This is the episode I wanted as the season premiere. It got me jazzed up and excited for the show in a way I haven't been for quite some time. I can't wait to see Jon confront his killers next week!Unanswered Questions:For the love of the old gods and the new, WHERE is Petyr Baelish?So, can Rhaegal and Viserion get out now that they're unchained? Because that could be interesting.Where is Sam? I find it odd that we haven't seen GRRM's analog yet, given how many other plots we've touched on.The other Lannister sibling is hearing about the dragons' hunger strike, and decides to free them. Curiously, the dragons don't eat him - or roast, or even singe him - and they didn't really leave? I'm not exactly sure what happened there. No Dany this week, she's travelling. We get two quick scenes of the Stark sisters, one at Braavos where the blind beggar girl gets a beating once again before the kindly old Jaqen H'ghar takes her back, and one in the north where Theon is saying goodbye to Sansa. When he said home, does he mean Pyke? Or is he going to Winterfell so he can try and kill Ramsay? I think it's the former, because kingsmoot is coming.The introduction of Euron was not that great, and without the terrifying tales about him, his boasts were rather hilarious. The last of the Five Kings to war for Westeros is dead now, and at the end of his funeral it was made clear that there will be a kingsmoot. We know Asha is going to be there, and Euron, and maybe even Theon would reach in time. Perhaps Theon will be given Victarion's task, wouldn't that be a surprise?The most shocking part of the episode was probably what happened at Winterfell. Ramsay commits patricide, step-matricide and half-fratricide without blinking an eye. Of course, I should have seen this coming, and I know quite a few who did, but I was really expecting the reverse - that Roose would recognize the threat and have Ramsay silently killed. Oh well, another main family line has been destroyed. There was a number of reveals before the stabbing though - someone has killed the sixth Bolton soldier that Brienne et al missed, Ramsay was dropping the Umber and the Manderly names, and there is a Karstark son still alive! (I know Harrion didn't die in the books, but still.)Finally, the Wall. We were warned it was going to be bad, though: \"I have never been much of a writer. Apologies for what you're about to see.\" When the attempt on Jon happened in the books, Castle Black was already at chaos, and it's really hard to guess what was going to happen - two factions of the Night's Watch, a large group of wildlings, the Queen's Men, and an angry giant were all there, and I still can't think of what's going to happen there. But the show, though, made it all a joke. I've already written two answers (one, two) about the resurrection being underwhelming, but even before that we saw the chaos die down quietly. Alliser has men breaking down that door, with Davos and the others getting ready for a fight, the wildlings arrive, and then it's over. Alliser is arrested, and I suppose some of the other conspirators would also be thrown into cells until Jon can behead them. Sigh.", "\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606-Some of the most disappointing video media I've ever seen.Like others, spoilers ahead. My running issue with GoT, is a complete disrespect for the complexity of the original story. What most viewers see as shocking and surprising, I know to be sterile and in many ways banal compared to the books. I'm not just saying the usual \"the books are better, waaah!\", I'm talking about the basic knowledge that railroaded, cliche plots, just aren't good. Particularly, here are some utter failures in S06E02:Jon Snow:Let's kick it off with the biggest news. This scene sucked. Davos was the convincing voice for Melisandre? This is so absurd. How does a stammering, uninspiring request from someone she thinks low of convince her to reverse a recent total upheaval of faith?! This was shitty writing. I can't imagine this is how GRRM drew it up, and I refuse to accept that it is until I see Winds(If it is, I'll still be annoyed, and disappointed in GRRM). After this travesty, the idiotic hocus-pocus(Even in the after-show, David talks about how she is just trying to say the right words), was an absolute shit-show. A word on acting: both Carice(Mel) and Liam(Davos) were shit in this episode. I absolutely love Liam, and find him to be one of the highlights of the show acting-wise, but seriously he dropped the ball. Carice is always awful, but particularly bad this round. The scene was botched from start to finish. The symbolism of Ghost moving was both heavy-handed to appeal to lowest-common-denominator viewers, and simultaneously, under-sold in the cinematography department. We all knew Jon wasn't dead, and it's fine to try to trick some people into believing what they saw in this episode, but at least have some respect for symbolism. This is completely contrasting with how well shot Jon's death was. Did the Jon Snow budget dry up or something?Dorne:My frustration with the Dorne storyline in the show is not minor, and this episode was again, below the already sorry average. The treachery in Dorne was completely dull. People died, it wasn't exciting, and hardly surprising, what was shown was utilitarian and unemotional. The dialogue in all this: drivel.Tyrion and the Mereen:I adore Dinklage, and normally he can do no wrong, but honestly, his lines were delivered flatly. Additionally, the interaction with the dragons was extremely boring. I'm ready to buy that the dragons would suffer his presence, and let him unchain them; I'm even ready to accept them just letting walk out of there; my beef was with how little reaction they had. I think the common defense is to claim that they were tired and weak from starvation, but honestly, that feels like an excuse. Again, I think the writing was hugely disappointing for this scene.\u00a0 Cersei and King's Landing:I love Lena in her role as Cersei, and thought her acting was fine, here, but everyone around her sucked. Dean-Charles(Tommen) is abysmal, and his two monologues were nails-on-a-chalkboard. The one saving grace in this episode was the excellent scene between the High Sparrow and Jaime. Boltons and Sansa/Theon/Brienne:The scene with Ramsay was very predictable, but mostly fine. Iwan(Ramsay) is still a phenomenal actor, and even if the lines were a little underwhelming in his scenes, he can make anything vile/terrifying. The scene with the escapees was alright, and I thought the component of Sansa forgetting the words to the Knight's creed was a nice touch--probably my favorite thing about the episode. Iron Islands:Finally.... It's about time. Looking forward to this storyline, a little nervous about certain things transitioning from the books. all in all, the writing in this show was particularly bad. In a world where the books were poorly written, this would be annoying; but in our world, where the source text is of such impeccable quality, this is beyond offensive. I am still shocked that GRRM would let people butcher his stories as they are. I would really have expected him to have more self-respect.", "The episode was good. And not in a cheerful kind of way, the game of thrones way. My rating:\u00a0 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 SPOILERS AHEAD. First off, the resurrection of Jon snow was beautiful. The best way an episode ends is by some shocking event, and this is perfect. I can't wait for the next episode, when everyone's down thinking Jon's dead, and he walks into the room. (Maybe they'd be even fighting or saying stuff like \"I'll stab him again if I have to\", and Jon has a dramatic entrance)Arya! Finally her days of begging are over. Or maybe it'll get even worse. All in all, her story, even though moving at a glacial pace, is taking new turns. Good.Sansa and theon. They've made peace. I know Sansa forgave him the moment they jumped, but she expresses it for the first time. That's good because there are very few people you can trust in westeros, and Sansa desperately needs one.\u00a0 (Lol too bad he's leaving)Now, the happenings at Pyke ( that's the name right?) are interesting. The iron born leader is dead. The rugged sea captain asha greyjoy is up for some challenges. looking okay-ish. Oh and theon is returning so, let's see. It might get more than okay.Now my favorite part, and the part I'm looking forward to the most this season. Kings landing! If I have to say it in one word, it's 'hell yeah!'. The Mountain crushing that drunk peasants head is one of its kind. Call me different, but I love the Mountain from the end of season 5. You know what's the true beauty of game of thrones? The character development. The characters you've desperately hated and despised in one season are going to to be one some of your favorite characters in the next. Jaime was like that. People are getting a soft corner for cersei too. My favourite is the Mountain. At the end of season 4, I hated him for killing the red viper. Cut to the end of season 5, he shows up in an armor, and covers cersei. In season 6, just the sight of him walking behind cersei is making my hair rise. Hell yeah! Try touching her now. I mean the guard actually sighed that the Mountain retreated. Bad-ass. Oh and the faith is going to be screwed. Very badly. I can see the high sparrows future written on his face. The three eyed Raven said there'll be a war. But he didn't say where. It's at the south lads, not north. Dorne is going to attack kings landing. And there'll be an internal war too, when the faith is destroyed. The only hope for lannisters are Tyrells this time. Cause there is no wildfire, there is no Tyrion or tywin. Maybe Keval Lannister will help. Whatever it is, lannisters have to be ready. Oh and did we talk about how awesome Tyrion is? He wanted a dragon as a pet! And now he have got one.I think Danny and Tyrion should seriously get together. how cool would that be? ", "4 stars out of 5.\u00a0 I really enjoyed \"Home.\" It was way, way, way better than the first episode of Season 6.\u00a0 I loved the scenes with Bran and Bloodraven.\u00a0 Those were some of my favorite scenes in Game of Thrones of all time.\u00a0 I've always liked Bran's storyline the most because he's he only character who feels like he's on a quest to save the world; everyone else feels like they are just playing in the mud.\u00a0 Seeing the young Hodor (did he stop speaking when Lyanna died?) and the young Ned was awesome. I enjoyed the zombie Mountain wrecking shit.\u00a0 I want to see him pull apart the Faith Militant limb from limb.\u00a0 How awesome would that be to see him take down those sanctimonious bastards?\u00a0 I didn't like the scenes with Tommen.\u00a0 The actor playing Tommen is rather ineffectual, especially when sparring with heavyweights like Lena Headey.\u00a0 The High Sparrow's scene was okay, but really predictable.\u00a0 I wish Jaime had followed his arc from the books -- slowly becoming a good person rather than retreating into the orbit of his mentally deranged sister.I was truly shocked by Roose Bolton's death.\u00a0 I liked his character.\u00a0 He was basically a wilder version of Tywin Lannister: Incredibly smart, ruthless, and a genuine power player.\u00a0 And both of them got killed by sons who they only grudgingly accepted.\u00a0 Karma?Ramsay has always been a sadistic maniac, but killing his stepmother and baby brother takes that to a whole new level.\u00a0\u00a0 I was thoroughly shocked.I'd say my only quibble was that Balon Greyjoy's death felt like it was added to this episode unnecessarily.\u00a0 Part of the problem is that the Iron Islands, much like Dorne, are largely ignored by the TV show, so anything that happens in them -- even big things like coups and assassinations -- doesn't have the same emotional impact of, say, Roose Bolton's death or the Red Wedding.\u00a0 I like the fact that the dragons don't seem to hate Tyrion.\u00a0 This of course strengthens the theory that he will ride a dragon.\u00a0 But either way, it's great to see them free to wreak havoc and fire on the world.I loved the way that Jon's resurrection was handled.\u00a0 Melisandre had been a pretty annoying character with her sanctimonious bullshit.\u00a0 She always felt like a con artist, even though we'd seen her pull off some big-time magic in the past.\u00a0 But now she was stripped to her core essence, and pulled off arguably the biggest feat of magic in the entire series.\u00a0\u00a0 Bravo to her.\u00a0 I was so excited by this event concluding the episode that I could hardly sleep after watching it.Let's hope the rest of the season is as good as this episode.\u00a0 \"Hodor.\"-Hodor", "Well many people here have shared their opinion about how they felt about the latest episode, that is why I am not going to through with that again. But, I would like to bring your attention to something that made me excited!First of all- Did anyone of you felt weird that House Karstark, House Umber,etc are supporting House Bolton to rule the North and yet I get the feeling that they are plotting and pitting House Bolton against itself?As many of you must have been familiar with the theory of \"The Grand Northern Conspiracy\" https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/...After watching the latest episode where Ramsay Stabs Roose Bolton and I felt that there was no expression from Lord Karstark present during the aftermath. This means two things:-Lord Kartark knew Ramsay was going to kill Bolton which means that all the Northern houses were in on this coup.2. Lord Karstark is a member of the conspiracy whose main aim was to pit Roose and Ramsay against each other so that they would become weak and finally they will rebel with Jon Stark (Robb Stark made Jon heir to Winterfell according to this theory) leading the charge against Ramsay.As the series is progressing I am getting more and more convinced that The Grand Northern Conspiracy is indeed true.What do you guys think about it? Please comment and share your views.", "Rating: 4/5Here is something I found amazing about the episode:The episode is called \"Home\", now relating this concept of Home to the characters,Bran: Saw Winterfell, even though in a past tense, he refers to wanting to spend more time there.Jon: He just returns, nothing too much there.Tommen: Feels he's been doing something wrong and wants to fix it, and be strong for his mother.Arya: She is taken off the streets, to the only place she thinks she belongs currently.Greyjoys: Balon's brother returns to the Pyke to take want he wants.Melisandre: She doesn't know about Jon yet, but her faith returning is surely a boast to her character.Theon: Wants to get back\u00a0 to the Iron Islands again.Ramsay: Tries to eliminate anyone in his path to create something of his own.The way the characters are matched to the concept of home in their own perspectives is pretty brilliant.The WallThough the come back of Jon Snow felt too predictable, it reflects a side of Ser Davos. Ser Davos, I believe, is an skeptical agnostic character, this quality of his, helps him to question everything while keep his hopes high for a miracle or rather, just a way to deal with things. Him getting Melisandre to try to revive Jon is a huge boast to this nature of his. This also shall boast Melisandre's faith and belief accordingly.King's LandingTommen\u00a0 stops Cersei from visiting Myrcella's funeral. Jamie, while dissatisfied with Tommen's reaction to the whole Cersei scenario, makes him visit her. While Jamie is visited by the High Sparrow to just remind him how the city has changed since Jaime has been on his trip to Dorne, the tone is quite mildly threatening but shows the powerful side of the High Sparrow. On the other hand, Tommen lets out his worries for Cersei and his feeling of being insufficient as a king. We see an eager Tommen to make the difference from here on for the love and sarifice Cersei has provided to all Lannister children.MeerenTyrion feels lost with no good news from the council and hence decides to be a smartass he is. He tries to confront the dragons with a tale form his children and ends up setting the dragons free of their chain, we don't see the dragons exiting the chamber but Tyrion soon realizes he may have just done something with a stomach full of wine.Iron IslandsThere is mystery visitor to see Balon Greyjoy, they have a very interesting talk over the suspended bridges between two towers at the Pyke. Soon, the vistior, Balon's brother, lets his thought known and gives Balon the death he deserves. Later, Yara promises to find the killer and avenge the death of Balon. She realises she doesnt have the support yet to be the next ruler of the Iron islands, little does she know her uncle is here for the same.WinterfellRamsay shows how he's the next Joffery. We see Roose Bolton discussing with a Karstark and is mad at Ramsay for losing out on Sansa. Ramsay proposes plan to attack the Night's Watch and kill Jon Snow, to which Lorn Bolton compares Ramsay to a 'mad-dog' that he is. Soon, the maester announces the birth of Roose Bolton's new child, who is a boy. This threatens Ramsay and he ends up killing Roose Bolton pretty much the exact way Roose killed Robb Stark, karma at work. The Karstark standing there the whole time isn't surprised at all. He then moves on to take care of Walda Bolton and the new born, using his hounds to take care of the two, we see a crazy smirk rise on Ramsay's face. The hounds aren't as useless as them seem then, cause they totally ran out on Brienne.Somewhere north to Winterfell, Sansa has forgiven Theon and wants him to know she shall stand by him even if Jon doesn't. Theon decides to part ways with Sansa and return home to the Pyke now that he has repaid for all his has done wrong. Overall, it was one of those episodes where we realize how the show is not juts made up characters like Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys, but also some suporting characters who tend to contribute a lot to the main characters.", "Beware of Spoilers, milords and ladies. I thought it met the standards set by the previous episode.Visit most characters, do not expand their plotlines in any conceivable ways, with just one hurrah moment to mark the episode's airing.Bran visited what had to be the most useless memory possible; where he watched Ned, Lyanna,Ben and Hodor as kids.\u00a0 I guess it's been proven once and for all that Hodor is not a teen in the show (PS that was a joke). That memory is sweet, but doesn't say much. What iI mean is, a season and an episode without Bran and this is his reentry? Not very good.I wanted to watch the Arya bit in detail so II mostly skipped that, but her insistence that she was \"no one\", despite the offer of restored eyesight was well done.Ramsay killed Roose. Didn't see that coming. Not so soon, not so sudden.Tyrion is trying Quentyn's trick. Hope it works better than it did for Quentyn.So the show finally says that both Astapor and Yunkai are independent of Dany. Oh, and slaving again. We don't get Quentyn's unique viewpoint of what that independence brought with it, so it's just a detail. I'm not really into the Tyrion arc this season. Yet. With luck it avoids a Dornish sidetrip.I didn't watch the Lannisters' bit closely either but I do like what I see. Cersei is trying to fight her way out of her corner, Jaime had a little confrontation with the High Sparrow. And Sansa. Alive and well. Theon too. And not dying of Hypothermia. I thought she and Theon waded through a river?Finally, and most interestingly. Jon is alive. Without any pomp and show, whatsoever. The anticonspirators' climax came remarkably out of the blue, keeping pace with a fast moving episode. In seconds, the Night's Watch is suppressed. I guess it helps to have a giant on this side of the Wall. Then Melisandre just mutters the Red Priestess mantra, nothing happens for a bit. Then Jon Awakens. So whatever happens between his stabbing and resurrection is a mystery for now. I think that Ghost wasn't warged. Didn't look like that to me. But the interim between death and return. Did nothing truly happen? Will he execute Ser Thorne as \"Jon Targaryen, First of his name\"? I certainly hope not. All in all, it's not a full episode. There's something lacking.Oh well. One thing I will say is that this episode, like the previous one, is a build up. When seen as one, it leaves you wondering what's on the horizon.", "Boooo !!!!We wait in anticipation of new book and show for this moment........\u00a0 we all knew it was coming.... and it could not have been done by D+D in a more dull and disappointing scene ever.Ser Davos:\u00a0 Gee whiz can you use ya magic. Mel: Duh I dunno.\u00a0\u00a0 I have no confidence...\u00a0 Wah.\u00a0\u00a0 Oga boggidy Bo....\u00a0 see I told ya so.\u00a0 I am such a failure.\u00a0\u00a0 Everybody leave sad.... and then the dog roll over and farts and it is done.She did not even plant him one right on the lips!!!\u00a0 Snow white and the poison apple are laughing at this.Terrible that the book did not come out first.\u00a0\u00a0 The producers think we were too dumb to follow the way it should have been written.\u00a0 As I said Disney would have done it better.It was just plain ..... Blah.\u00a0\u00a0 It is like they are just going through the motions to get on with the story.", "This didn't redeem the show's many book departures, but\u00a0 the Iron Islands look to be more interesting then the pregnant pause that was Dorne. The sooner we brush that area of Westeros off the better. That being said, I'm glad to see Bran and Hodor again. Also, I really liked watching the flashbacks, even if I had to go meta to see the point of it.The Wall was fine. I like the Wall it's big. I loved the scenes with Mel and Davos, it made up for everything else that was lack luster. The wall has always been kind of boring to me anyway.\u00a0 The theme of Mellisandre being cold and vulnerable was awesome because it really showed a human side of the priestess and I want to see more of that.Winterfell was a finally moment for me. We've seen Ramsay be flippant, cruel, and brutally effective. However he's never gone full psychopath that we know Book Ramsay has gone. Until today that is!\u00a0 Ramsay\u00a0 has always been a mad dog, and will be bent over like one soon enough, but now lets revel in the full on psychopath.\u00a0 The show has been too scared to show us his true nature, but has finally succeeded in letting the handsome petulant Ramsay with daddy issues into a full on serial psychopath he deserves to be.Kings Landing is boring and will spice up when they finally decide to give us a direction. Everything KL is filler as far as I'm concerned until they actually decided how the humiliated Cersei will strike back, and whether her brother will remain her sword and lapdog.Khal Moro and the five greatest things were missed and exchanged for a scene of Tyrion having his mary sue moment to pet the dragons. Is petting a dragon one of the sixth greatest things in the world?Honorable Mentions:Zomg! Jon Snow is alive.\u00a0 As a book reader can we please move on from that.Sansa asking about her sister was sweet. Arya is truly no one now, or is she?", "Sunday night\u2019s episode of Game of Thrones ended with a bang, confirming years and years of fan theories and undoubtedly making TV viewers the world over jump with joy.Jon Snow is alive, brought back by Melisandre, the Red Priestess, at the behest of Davos. She thinks she\u2019s failed. They all think she\u2019s failed. But then, as Davos leaves the room, we see Ghost stir. He senses something, just like I knew he would. Why else would they keep showing him sleeping beneath Jon\u2019s pallid corpse?Then, with a gasp, Jon Snow\u2019s dark eyes open.There was a moment when I thought, \u201cAh, this is cruel. They\u2019re putting yet another fan theory to rest, in the most protracted, painful way possible.\u201d But no, we were right all along. Jon was dead, but he\u2019s alive again.To be fair, we don\u2019t quite know what the implications of this are. Will he be like Beric Dondarrion, the Robin Hood-esque rebel knight of the Riverlands who\u2019s been brought back to life countless times by his very own Red Priest? Or will he be changed in some other, perhaps darker way like a certain character who never joined us in the TV show, but whose ominous and vengeful presence was felt rather poignantly in the books?Source:- 'Game Of Thrones' Season 6, Episode 2 Review: Home", "For the first time the series went towards the norm, meaning what was expected out of it, Melisandre reviving Jon Snow. Frankly speaking, I have loved the books and the series because of the vicissitudes it always carried. I am glad that Jon is back, but am disappointed cause it was too clinched.\u00a0 The best part for me was watching young Ned, Benjen and Lyanna. I have always loved the Starks and wanted answers to Lyanna's and Rhegar's chemistry. Bran's walk down the memory lane was my only motivation to read ahead in A Dance With Dragons. We will indeed see a lot of surprises through his greenseeing. ", "I Liked the episode but it did feel a it rushed.Emilia Clarke did say that it's gonna be like season 4 where everything just keeps happening but I didn't expect to cover up have the things we saw in GOT S6 Trailer 2.I liked Bran's vision and they finally introduced Lyanna Stark so I guess R+L=J is gonna happen. Next Hodor has a name Wyliss. I guess we're soon gonna know what trauma happened with him.Arya still getting beat up. Bored me.Sansa Theon's teary goodbye was a bit emotional.No sign of Dany. Good thing.Tyrion playing with the dragons then getting scared in the end was thrilling. Guess he might just ride one of them.As for the Jon Snow resurrection thing, I expected a bit more TBH. Melisandre just said some incantations to bring him back. I hoped more. It's clear that he was warged into Ghost. ", "Is nobody going to talk about Melisandre actually being an honest-to-god hag? Is that something were just not going to bring up again?I thought H'gar was deadWill someone rid me of this turbulent psychopath?!What's up with the tree girl?Did the faith militant cut her balls off?Apparently Deus ex Machina is spelled \"W-I-L-D-L-I-N-G\" nowThree castles connected by shitty rope bridges and you're telling me with a straight face that he's the first important person to have \"fallen\" off...Well, we all knew that was coming. Having been stabbed before, I'd be very upset if you brought me back to life in a world with no vicodin.", "Very rapid pacing, which is sort of typical of episodes 2 to 5 from other seasons as well. The season premiere was for tying up some cliffhangers, while also getting us back into the flow. The second acts as if it has to make up for the languorous pacing of the first by careening at breakneck speed down the mountain.Are they setting up Ramsay Bolton as some sort of arch villain? It sure feels like that, where in the books he is quite psychopathic but doesn't seem like nearly as much of a threat outside of his own sphere of influence.Also, that \"surprise ending\" has to be the least surprising surprise ever. (I think I'll have a heart attack and die from not-surprise!) I suppose I was moderately surprised that Jon wasn't warged into the wolf, biding his time, because the wolf seemed as downcast as any of the humans until it happened.", "The motto of this show has been the same since the very beginning. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. Sometimes, just when it seems like winning is right around the corner, it turns out to be a nasty case of death instead. Westeros is a land where good, honorable people die terrible deaths, and also a land where despicable people die terrible deaths as well. Generally, everyone dies a terrible death. Valar morghulis.North-Jon Snow\u2019s resurrection may have been the big reveal of this episode, \u201cHome\u201d but there was a ton more going on in the episode.North of the Wall, Bran Stark has visions of his father and uncles and his aunt Lyanna as children play-fighting in Winterfell. Hodor is there, though they call him Willas, and he can speak in words other than \u201cHodor.\u201d Curiouser and curiouser. I have to say, it\u2019s no accident we see young Ned and Lyanna the same episode Jon Snow is brought back from the dead.Meera, for her part, seems jaded and restless, but the Child of the Forest assures her that Bran will need her. \u201cHe won\u2019t be in there forever,\u201d she tells the girl.Bran talks briefly with the Three-Eyed Raven and Meera, but not a lot happens here. I did love the Three-Eyed Raven\u2019s line when Bran gets upset for being taken from his vision. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long you\u2019ll drown.\u201d (Or something to that effect.)\u201cI wasn\u2019t drowning,\u201d Bran shoots back. \u201cI was home.\u201dAnd there we have the title of the episode. Now that we have it, let\u2019s not tarry any longer. The White Walkers are about. Let\u2019s fly south to\u2026Winterfell-Brienne and Sansa talk briefly about where to go, and Brienne asks Sansa what happened to her while in Winterfell. Sansa says she should have gone with Brienne when she had the chance, but Brienne is gracious. \u201cIt was a very hard decision,\u201d she says. They speak of Arya before Sansa goes to check on Theon.Poor Theon, he\u2019s a wreck still. He can\u2019t go to Castle Black because Jon will surely kill him for his crimes against the Starks. \u201cI won\u2019t let him,\u201d Sansa says. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.\u201d But Theon doesn\u2019t want to go, doesn\u2019t even want to be forgiven. Theon will ride West to the Iron Islands. Here, Roose Bolton speaks condescendingly to his crazy bastard son, Ramsay. Ramsay wants to attack Castle Black and kill Jon (who he doesn\u2019t know is dead\u2026or, uh, alive again I guess). Roose says that if you act like a mad dog, you\u2019ll be treated like one. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed. Torrhen Karstark stands nearby, ready to pledge his sword to eliminating the Starks since Robb beheaded his father.And just at that moment, in walks the Maester with news that Lady Walda has had a baby boy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll always be my firstborn,\u201d Roose says to Ramsay. \u201cThank you father,\u201d Ramsay replies. \u201cThat means so much to me.\u201dThen he stabs him to death. Roose is dead, \u201cpoisoned by our enemies\u201d according to Ramsay.The Iron Islands-Here Yara and Balon Greyjoy are arguing the merits of invading the mainland. She\u2019s against such a foolish, pompous venture. He\u2019s the last of the five clashing kings, and thinks that in and of itself is victory enough\u2014a sign to keep on fighting for no good reason. Yara reminds him that the last time they tried this, Ned Stark knocked down his castle, killed two of his sons, and took Theon hostage.Balon storms out, walking out into the rain on the most frightening looking rope bridge I can imagine walking across in the middle of a storm. A shadowy figure stands on the other side. It\u2019s Euron Greyjoy, Balon\u2019s little brother. Euron is insane and cruel and arrogant, and says it\u2019s his time to rule and Balon is in his way. Naturally, he throws him from the bridge into the rocky sea below.They send Balon\u2019s body out to sea, and Yara swears she\u2019ll exact vengeance on whoever killed him. The priest reminds her that she isn\u2019t the ruler, that this will be decided at the kingsmoot, where the Iron Islanders pick their next ruler. King\u2019s Landing-Here, the Lannisters are trying their best to regain a footing in the tumultuous capital. The Sparrows are still exerting far too much control, but there seems to be little anyone can do about it. At best, Cersei is exacting a petty sort of vengeance on the people who mocked her in the streets. The guy who flashed her is boasting about it in his cups. He goes to relieve himself and Cersei\u2019s zombie knight, the resurrected Gregor Clegane, smashes his head into the wall. The violence is almost comical.Jaime and the High Sparrow have it out in the High Sept, over the body of Myrcella. The High Sparrow really is a cocky little man and far too self-assured. He reminds Jaime that his people have nothing to lose. No wealth, no families, no names, and yet together they can \u201coverthrow an empire.\u201d Sure, the man deserves credit for making some pretty savvy moves against Cersei and Tommen. But Cersei is a terrible leader and Tommen is a boy. Notice, the High Sparrow didn\u2019t make any plays against Tywin Lannister when he was alive and Joffrey was king, nor against Robert. He\u2019s slithered in during a time of chaos and made some very good political power plays.Braavos-Here, Arya Stark tells the man we know as Jaqen H\u2019ghar three times that \u201ca girl has no name\u201d even as he tempts her with food, shelter, and her sight. \u201cCome, follow me,\u201d he tells her, instructing her to leave her beggar\u2019s dish. \u201cA girl is not a beggar,\u201d he says. Thank goodness we don\u2019t have to see Arya get beat up again by that other girl, who seems to take the whole thing far too personally to be \u201ca girl with no name\u201d herself.Meereen-Here, Tyrion reminds Varys and the others that dragons cannot survive captivity. Dany\u2019s ancestors rode on dragons accustomed to ranging for hundreds of miles. They conquered Westeros with those dragons. But their descendants chained up their dragons, until they were no bigger than cats. Until they went extinct.So, perhaps because he is well into his drink, Tyrion ventures down into the vast dungeon hall where Daenerys has chained two of her dragons, Rhaegel and Viserion, and frees them. They\u2019re intelligent creatures, he reasons, and they\u2019ll realize he\u2019s their friend. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d asks Missandei. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do,\u201d Tyrion replies. \u201cI drink and I know things.\u201dSo, torch in hand, he reaches out to the two captive dragons.\u201cI\u2019m here to help,\u201d he tells them. \u201cDon\u2019t eat the help.\u201dHe also tells them how he wanted a dragon of his own, and cried himself to sleep when he discovered they were all dead. \u201cAnd yet here you are,\u201d he says.It\u2019s a great, tense moment. When Tyrion rushes away up the stairs, Varys looks at him with a look of shock. It\u2019s quite the expression coming from the usually cool and collected Spider, whose typical emotional range runs between smug and faux concern.Good for Tyrion to free the dragons, though we don\u2019t yet know how they get out of the palace or what happens next.Castle Black-Davos is really the central hero here. In the beginning of the episode, he and his companions and Ghost ready themselves to fight against the vile Alliser Thorne. Just when all seems lost, Eddison Tollett shows up with the Wildlings, led by Tormund Giantsbane. One giant smashing a Crow against the wall and tossing his broken body aside convinces the rest of the Night\u2019s Watch to lay down their arms. Alliser is arrested and the good guys, for once, triumph over the villains.This is the second piece of good news in Season 6, following the rescue of Theon and Sansa by Brienne of Tarth last week. But it\u2019s not the last.Once again, it\u2019s Davos who comes to the rescue. He champions the idea of bringing Jon Snow back from the dead to Melisandre, who has lost faith in her Lord of Light. If he hadn\u2019t been there, she wouldn\u2019t have bothered, and they would have burnt his body beyond all revival.(Book readers will know that this can\u2019t quite go down the same way in the books, which means that in the books it\u2019s still possible that Jon Snow won\u2019t return at all.)Sources-Game Of Thrones season 6 episode 2 review: Home'Game Of Thrones' Season 6, Episode 2 Review: Home ", "I liked it but I am starting to notice that everything (like the resurrection) is happening in a less dramatic way than a lot of us expected/wanted.

I can only imagine how it seems to you.  I did what I thought was right.  And I got murdered for it.  And now I'm back.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe we'll never know.  What does it matter?  You go on.  You fight for as long as you can.  You clean up as much of the shit as you can.  I don't know how to do that.  I thought I did, but  I failed.  Good.  Now go fail again.  (door opens)  They think you're some kind of god.  The man who returned from the dead.  I'm not a god.  I know that.  I saw your pecker.  What kind of god would have a pecker that small?  (both chuckle)  (winces)  (winces)  Your eyes are still brown.  Is that still you in there?  I think so.  Hold off on burning my body for now.  (laughs)  That's funny.  You sure that's still you in there?  (laughs)  (thunder crashing)  - (chatter) - (Sam groans)  You all right?  Yes. Yes, I'm fine.  Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see  because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?  I don't think so.  Sea, see.  They're spelled different, but they sound the same.  Yeah, they do.  It was before I learned how to read, obviously.  Sam, are you going to be sick?  Won't be long. We'll be in the south soon.  I'm excited to see Oldtown.  Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros.  Are you going to vomit again?  No. No, no, no.  The Citadel doesn't admit women.  There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam.  I stayed at Castle Black. There's no women allowed there.  The Citadel isn't Castle Black.  I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester Aemon  to help me bend the rules.  I'll stay in Oldtown, then.  By yourself?  With a baby and no money?  So if we're not going to Oldtown,  where are you taking me?  To my home.  Horn Hill.  My father's-- well, my father,  but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.  They'll take care of you both.  \"Wherever you go, I go, too.\"  That's what you said.  I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.  That's all I want--  to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes  so you'll be safe.  Us and everyone else in the world.  I don't care about them.  Well, no, I do, but I don't really.  I care about you and him.  I know that, Sam.  And he does, too.  You're the only one who ever has.  If you think it's for the best,  we trust you.  I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.  I'd never do that to the father of my son.  (coughs)  (horses whinny)  (distant horse whinnies)  (horse whinnies)  That's my father.  The man beside him is Howland Reed,  Meera's father.  Ser Arthur Dayne.  The Sword of the Morning.  Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.  Lord Stark.  I looked for you on the Trident.  We weren't there.  Your friend the usurper  would lie beneath the ground if we had been.  The Mad King is dead.  Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.  Why weren't you there to protect your prince?  Our prince wanted us here.  Where's my sister?  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.  And now it begins.  No.  Now it ends.  (shouts)  (groans)  (shouts)  (gurgles)  (groans)  He's better than my father.  Far better.  But Father beat him.  Did he?  I know he did.  Heard the story a thousand times.  (grunts)  He stabbed him in the back.  (woman screams)  What's in the tower?  That's enough for one day.  We'll visit again another time.  - I want to see where he's going. - Time to go.  (screaming continues)  Father!  (gasps)  Why did you do that?  Take me back there. I want to go back.  No.  - He heard me. - Maybe.  - Maybe he heard the wind. - He heard me.  The past is already written. The ink is dry.  What's in that tower?  I want to go back there.  I've told you many times, stay too long  where you don't belong and you will never return.  Why do I want to return?  So I can be a cripple again?  So I can talk to an old man in a tree?  You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years  watching the world from a distance  as the roots grew through me?  So why did you?  I was waiting for you.  I don't want to be you.  (laughs) I don't blame you.  You won't be here forever.  You won't be an old man in a tree.  But before you leave,  you must learn.  Learn what?  Everything.  (chatter)                                                                    I don't know how you stand it in all that leather.  If we could have the room.  You look lovely today, my dear. You really do.  How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.  If you're going to torture me,  just call them back and get on with it.  I am not a torturer.  Though it so often is what people deserve.  And it does provide answers.  But they're usually the wrong answers.  My job is to find the right answers.  Do you know how I do that?  I do it by making people happy.  I'd like to make you happy, Vala.  That's your name, isn't it, Vala?  (chuckles) That's all right.  I know who you are and what you've done.  You've done a lot.  You've sacrificed your body for a cause,  which is more than most people do.  And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy  murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.  The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers  brought here by a foreign queen  to destroy our city and our history.  I understand.  Well, that makes perfect sense  from your perspective.  I have a different perspective, of course.  I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective  just as I will try to see them from yours.  Because that is the only way  that I can make you and Dom happy.  That is how you pronounce it-- Dom?  I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.  Such a handsome boy.  Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.  Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?  You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son.  Children are blameless.  I have never hurt them.  Your boy is in no immediate danger,  this I swear to you.  But between us, dear,  you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.  We both know the penalty for that crime.  How will poor Dom get on without his mother?  And with his breathing problem.  If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.  So either you kill me or they do.  Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.  There is a third option, though.  A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.  I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son.  I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.  Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask  one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it.  Far too heavy for me.  The boat sails at dawn.  You need to decide now.  A new life for you and Dom  or  What should we do while we wait?  To pass the time, what should we do?  What should we talk about?  You speak 19 languages.  You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.  You two, you spend a great deal of time together.  What would you be talking about if I weren't here?  Patrol.  When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.  What we see on patrol.  Who we captured on patrol.  That's good. That's very good.  But that's a report.  I was thinking more of a conversation.  A wise man once said the true history of the world  is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.  Who said this?  Me.  Just now.  All right, no conversations.  Let's play a game.  You don't play games, either one of you, ever?  Games are for children.  Missandei: My master Kraznys  would sometimes make us play games.  There, that's a start.  - Only the girls. - No, no, no.  Not that. Of course not that.  Innocent games. Fun games.  Drinking games.  Missandei: We do not drink.  Until you do.  All right. No drinking.  We can play without drinking.  It's a wonderful game. I invented it.  Here's how it works.  I make a statement about your past.  If I'm wrong, I drink.  And if I'm right--  maybe we can't play without drinking.  (door opens)  Oh, you took your time.  Sorry.  I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy.  - Some things you can't rush. - You found out?  The Good Masters of Astapor  and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.  With help from their friends in Volantis.  Tyrion: You see?  You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion.  We only have to worry about  the three rich foreign cities paying for it.  We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.  We will do it again and execute the Masters.  If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,  who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?  If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?  We cannot.  The Masters speak only one language.  They spoke it to me for many years.  I know it better than my mother tongue.  If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them.  May it be the last thing they ever hear.  You may be right.  Grey Worm: So we will fight them?  - Possibly. - Possibly?  It's a conversation.  Tell me, can your little birds get a message  to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai,  and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?  Of course. Men can be fickle,  but birds I always trust.  (children chatting quietly)  Your eye looks much better, Arthur.  How's your mother's jaw?  Better.  And your father?  No one's seen him.  And no one will.  That worked out rather nicely.  Will Lord Varys ever come back?  I don't think so.  Do you miss him?  He was nice.  He called us his little birds.  He gave us sweets.  It's funny you should mention that.  Guess what I happened to find today.  Candied plums from Dorne.  (laughing)  Now remember, if any of your friends  like sweets or need help, they can always come to me.  All I need in return are whispers.  (door opens)  Qyburn: No need to be afraid.  This is Ser Gregor.  He's friends with all my friends.  Run along now.  Varys's little birds?  Your little birds now, Your Grace.  What did you do to him exactly?  I haven't been able to get a clear answer.  Oh, a number of things.  Does he understand what we're saying?  I mean, to the extent that he ever understood  complete sentences in the first place.  He understands well enough.  So tell him to march into the sept  and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon.  The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him.  Ser Gregor can't face them all.  And he won't have to.  He'll only have to face one.  Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?  Not yet.  That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.  Don't stop at the city.  I want little birds in Dorne,  in Highgarden, in the North.  If someone is planning on making our losses their gains,  I want to hear it.  If someone is laughing at the queen  who walked naked through the streets covered in shit,  I want to hear.  I want to know who they are.  I want to know where they are.  Pycelle: As bad as Lord Varys was, Qyburn is worse.  I told them all. I told them.  He's arrogant, dangerous.  You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason.  - And no one listened to my advice. - (door opens)  So here we are.  And what he's done to Gregor Clegane  is an abomination.  We never sanctioned this experiment.  I for one think it will be in our best interest  to have the beast dest--  (farts)  - Can I help you? - Why are you here?  - My mother-- - I was invited, my dear,  to help deal with several troublesome issues,  such as the queen's imprisonment.  Thank you for bringing it up.  It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.  Margaery is the queen.  You are not the queen  because you're not married to the king.  I do appreciate these things  can get a bit confusing in your family.  This is a small council meeting.  You have no position on the small council.  I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.  The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard  does have a position on the small council.  Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?  Well, um  I would say Ser Gerold Hightower  had a seat on the Mad King's council.  Of course, that was the Mad King.  King Robert saw things differently.  - And King-- - (loud thud)  What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?  Do you consider the murder of your own blood  a troublesome issue?  The same women who murdered Myrcella  have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne.  We've got a lot to discuss.  All of us together.  And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.  No, we cannot make you leave.  And you cannot make us stay.  Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.  - (door opens) - (armor rattling)  (groans) Your Grace.  My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place.  I'm sorry, Your Grace.  That's not possible. Not yet.  When will it be possible?  When she's fully atoned for her sins.  You cut off her hair and marched her naked  through the streets in front of the whole city.  That wasn't the full atonement?  No.  She must stand trial before seven septons  so we can learn the true extent of her sins.  I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place.  I am the king.  You are.  And what does that mean to you?  It means a great deal to me.  The Crown and the Faith  are the twin pillars of the world.  Do you know who told me that?  Your mother.  My mother who is unclean?  My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?  How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?  How did men and women  first come to feel the Mother's presence, hmm?  It was through their own mothers.  There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei. You know that.  But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.  Her love for you is more real  than anything else in this world  because it doesn't come from this world.  But you know that.  You've felt it.  You've seen her when she talks to you.  Yes.  It's a great gift.  One I never had.  Envy.  One more thing for me to atone for.  Your Grace, do you-- may I?  Do you mind?  It's my knees.  Of course.  When your mother made her walk of atonement,  she did it to get back to you.  I still don't understand why you want to put her  through any more than she's already endured.  It's not what I want. It's what the gods want.  They make their will known to us and it's up to us  to either accept or reject it.  Please.  If we're to be just and good,  then we accept it, all of us, even kings.  A true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can.  And no one is wiser than the gods.  My grandfather once said something similar.  Except for the part about the gods.  The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not.  As they work through your mother.  There's so much good in all of us.  The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.  (gasps)  (gasps)  Who are you?  No one.  (grunts)  Waif: Who were you before you came here?  Arya: Arya Stark.  (grunts)  Waif: Tell me about Arya Stark's family.  Her father was Eddard Stark.  Her mother was Catelyn Stark.  She had one sister, Sansa,  and four brothers.  (panting)  Three brothers.  Robb, Bran, Rickon.  And a half-brother Jon.  And where are they now?  Arya: They may be dead for all a girl knows.  (sniffs)  (sniffs)  Tell me about the Hound.  Arya: Also dead.  Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.  He was not on her list anymore.  She had taken him off it.  Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?  Arya: She did and she did not.  She sounds confused.  Yes, she was.  Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?  - (groans) - Arya: Cersei Lannister.  Gregor Clegane.  Walder Frey.  (rustling)  Waif: That's a short list.  (panting)  That can't be everyone you want to kill.  Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?  Which name would you like a girl to speak?  (shouts)  Jaqen: If a girl tells me her name,  I will give her eyes back.  A girl has no name.  Come.  If a girl is truly no one,  she has nothing to fear.  Who are you?  No one.  (horse whinnies)  The Umbers are a famously loyal house.  Famously loyal to the Starks.  And you, Lord Karstark.  Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they?  But here we are. Times change.  When my father became Warden of the North,  your house refused to pledge their banners.  Your father was a cunt.  My beloved father, the Warden--  Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him.  I might have done the same to my father  if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own.  My father was poisoned by our enemies.  Mmm.  Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?  The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We're farther north than any of you fuckers.  Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings. Been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.  So now you've come seeking help?  We need to help each other.  The colder it gets, the farther south those goat fuckers will roam.  Won't take them long to get here.  You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?  If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.  He knows this place better than we ever will.  Pledge your banners to House Bolton.  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North  and we will fight together to destroy the bastard  and all his wildling friends.  I'm not kissing your fucking hand.  Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.  I'm not doing that either.  Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?  Your father honored tradition.  Knelt for Robb Stark.  Called him King of the North.  Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?  Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.  Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.  I've got a gift for you.  A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.  A girl, aye.  (laughing)  A wild one.  I like them wild.  And the boy, nice and young.  The way Karstark likes them.  Who's this?  Rickon Stark.  How do I know that's Rickon Stark?  Welcome home, Lord Stark.  (pounding on door)  It's time.  If you have any last words, now is the time.  You shouldn't be alive.  It's not right.  Neither was killing me.  My mother's still living at White Harbor.  Could you write her?  Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.  I had a choice, Lord Commander.  Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.  You brought an army of wildlings into our lands.  An army of murderers and raiders.  If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up,  I pray I'd make the right choice again.  I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.  I fought, I lost.  Now I rest.  But you, Lord Snow,  you'll be fighting their battles forever.  (choking, gasping)  We should burn the bodies.  You should.  What do you want me to do with this?  Wear it.  Burn it.  Whatever you want.  You have Castle Black.  My watch is ended.", "summary": ["Plot Daenerys meets her future. Bran meets the past. Tommen confronts the High Sparrow. Arya trains to be No One. Varys finds an answer. Ramsay gets a gift.  Summary At the Wall Oathbreaker 18 Jon Snow returns.  As Jon Snow awakens and gasps for air, he slowly sits up and scans the room. He then looks down and is horrified by his stab wounds, confirming that it's not a bad dream he had. Davos Seaworth, having returned to the room on hearing the noise, is shocked but relieved and quickly helps Jon as he struggles to walk. Davos asks Jon if he remembers anything. Jon, still shocked, says yes, he remembers getting stabbed by Olly and Alliser Thorne for bringing the Wildlings to Castle Black. Melisandre enters, shocked that the resurrection has worked. She then goes to Jon and asks him where he was after his death. Jon replies he saw nothing, much to Melisandre's disappointment. Seizing on whatever hope she still has, however, she says that the Lord of Light brought Jon back for a reason; that Stannis was not The Prince That Was Promised, but \"someone must be.\" Davos asks Melisandre to leave them alone so Jon can adjust to his revival.  Davos grabs a stool and notes that Jon was dead and now he isn't, which is \"completely fucking mad\", but he can only imagine what Jon thinks of it. Jon laments that he tried to do what he thought was right, but got murdered for it and asks why he returned from the dead. Davos answers that they may never know, but it doesn't matter in the end, and the important thing is to fight and go on living for as long as possible. Jon thought he knew how to, but isn't sure anymore: he failed. \"Good,\" says Davos, \"and now go fail again.\"  After he has recovered somewhat, Jon dons his Night's Watch armor and the Lord Commander's cape, and walks into the courtyard, seeing many of the Free Folk and his fellow Brothers arrive before him. Jon, still struggling to walk properly, comes down and greets the dumbfounded Tormund. Tormund jokes with the resurrected Lord Commander before hugging him tightly which slightly pains Jon due to his stab wounds. Jon then greets the relieved Eddison Tollett and they embrace. Jon thinks it's still himself in his body, not a wight, so he jokes to hold off on burning his body for the time being.  Thorne hangs Jon Snow hangs the mutineers.  Some time later, Jon oversees the public hanging of the traitors responsible for the Mutiny at Castle Black: Bowen Marsh, Othell Yarwyck, Alliser Thorne and Olly. Jon asks if any of the men have last words to say. Bowen says Jon shouldn't be alive, stating that it's not right. Jon coldly replies, \"Neither was killing me.\" Yarwyck pleads Jon to write his mother in White Harbor that he died honorably fighting the Wildlings. Alliser says he had a choice: to betray his Commander or the Night's Watch. He then says that Jon bringing the Wildlings was a dangerous problem and had to be stopped, and warns him that Jon will be fighting their battles forever. Jon gives his respect to him, in that Alliser would follow his convictions even if he knew this would be the result beforehand because he believed he was doing the right thing.  Jon then moves on to Olly, who says nothing and glares furiously at Jon. Jon reluctantly cuts down the rope, killing all four traitors. Jon looks at Olly's lifeless body. Afterwards, Jon takes off his cloak and hands it to the confused Edd. Jon then says Edd can do whatever he wants with the cloak, unofficially designating Edd as the 999th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Jon then leaves the courtyards and declares his watch has ended, leaving the rest of the Brothers look on in shock.  In the Narrow Sea Samwell Tarly, Gilly, and her baby son Sam are sailing on a ship to Oldtown. Gilly and Sam have never been on a ship before. Samwell is seasick and begins throwing up into a chamber pot. Gilly assures Samwell that it won't be long and says that she can't wait to see Oldtown; the ship's captain told her that it's the most beautiful city in Westeros. While Samwell had originally planned to go and study at the Citadel, he adjusts his plans since he cannot bring Gilly and her child along as the Citadel only allows men within its walls.  For their safety, Samwell decides to take Gilly and Sam to his ancestral home of Horn Hill. While he does not get on with his father Randyll Tarly, Samwell assures Gilly that his mother and sister are very kind. Samwell wants to do everything to protect Gilly and her child from harm. Despite some unease, Gilly promises to follow Samwell and let him decide what is best for them.  Beyond the Wall Oathbreaker 20 Ned Stark in Bran's vision.  Bran has a vision of the past again. He and the Three-Eyed Raven are at the Tower of Joy in Dorne, shortly after the end of Robert's Rebellion. The last two of the Targaryen Kingsguard stand before the Tower and block the way of a small party of Northmen led by Eddard Stark himself. The Three-Eyed Raven identified one of Ned's companions as Howland Reed, Meera's father. Eddard tells Ser Arthur Dayne and Lord Commander Gerold Hightower to stand down, and asks why they weren't at the Trident. Ser Arthur states that Rhaegar Targaryen ordered them here to guard the tower, so there they remained, even as Rhaegar and the Mad King both died. Eddard asks where his sister Lyanna is, but Dayne simply wishes Stark the best in the wars to come. The two Kingsguard draw their swords, with Ser Arthur saying, \"And now it begins,\" to which Eddard replies, \"No, now it ends.\" The two sides clash, with Dayne making short work of a few of Ned's northmen. Ser Arthur slowly cuts down the number of northmen, but Ser Gerold falls to Ned's blade. Eventually, Ser Arthur duels Eddard one-on-one. Bran expresses his shock at Ser Arthur's skills, with the Three-Eyed Raven confirming that the Sword of the Morning is better than Ned. Dayne easily gains the upper hand and kicks Ned's sword away from him, but is unprepared for Howland stabbing him through the back of the neck. Eddard seems visibly uncomfortable at winning this way, but unhesitatingly delivers the killing blow to the incapacitated Ser Arthur. Bran is shocked, as he had heard tales of this duel and never expected his father to stand for such things.  Eddard runs towards the tower, having heard a woman's scream come from one of its windows towards the end of the duel. Bran runs to follow Eddard, calling out, but he is told it's time to go by the raven. Ned looks back for a second, seemingly hearing Bran, but then runs into the Tower. Bran tries to follow, but he is forced out of the past and back into the cave by the Three-Eyed Raven, saying he had already been in the past for too long. Bran is both angry and sad at this, but the raven asserts it was for his safety, and again sternly reminds him that the past cannot be changed. The raven further states that he's waited a thousand years for Bran to arrive, and that Bran will not share the raven's destiny. But before he can leave the cave, Bran must learn everything.  At King's Landing Varys lil birds spies The \"Little Bird\" Spies  Qyburn is in the company of the little birds, children who used to spy for Varys. Qyburn tries to win the favor of the children by attracting them with candied plums from Dorne. Shortly afterwards, Cersei, Jaime Lannister and the reanimated Ser Gregor Clegane enter. Cersei wants Qyburn to gather information from Dorne, Highgarden, the North and wherever people are trying to take advantage of their losses and plotting against them.  Oathbreaker 22 Jaime and Cersei try to intervene on the Small Council.  At the Small Council meeting, Grand Maester Pycelle complains about Qyburn and his experiments. Ser Kevan Lannister, now Hand of the King - is heading the Council \u2013 which now consists of himself, Pycelle, and Lord Mace Tyrell \u2013 with Lady Olenna Tyrell in attendance to lobby for Margaery and Loras Tyrell's release. Cersei, Jaime and Ser Gregor enter the room, startling Pycelle and Mace. On being questioned about what they are doing at a small council meeting, Cersei replies that she is the Queen, only to be corrected by Olenna that the rightful queen is the one married to the king and that Margaery is the one who fits that description. Jaime then argues that he, as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, also has a right to attend. Pycelle admits that Ser Gerold Hightower once sat on the council, but dismisses this due to the Mad King's eccentricities. Cersei accuses Kevan of not caring for her daughter Myrcella, while Jaime appeals to the bigger picture and urges Kevan to take action against Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes who have taken over Dorne after eliminating House Martell. Displeased with the newcomers, Ser Kevan and the small council leave the hall.  Meanwhile, an angry King Tommen Baratheon and his Kingsguard visits the High Sparrow to secure permission for Cersei to visit her daughter's resting place in the Great Sept. The High Sparrow replies that Cersei cannot visit because she still has not been cleared for the other sins that she is accused of. Tommen criticizes the High Sparrow for his self-righteous treatment of Cersei after she had atoned for two of her crimes. Despite their differences, the High Sparrow claims admiration for the deep love that Cersei has for her son, Tommen, which he attributes to the divine love of the Mother.  When Tommen asks the High Sparrow why he wants to put his mother through more trials, the Sparrow replies that he is merely carrying out the will of the Seven. He urges the young King to turn to the Seven for wisdom. Before Tommen leaves, less angry and more uncertain, the High Sparrow tells him that the Seven have worked through his grandfather and mother even though they may not acknowledge it.   In Meereen In the Great Pyramid, Varys holds court when the Unsullied bring in Vala, a prostitute who is in league with the Sons of the Harpy. She had seduced and murdered several members of the Second Sons and Unsullied. Vala is defiant and states that she opposes the new regime imposed by the Unsullied and Second Sons as illegitimate. She became a prostitute out of patriotic fervor for the old ways. Varys assures Vala he has no interest in torturing her and decides to strike a deal. In return for revealing who is funding the Sons of the Harpy, he offers her and her son safe passage on a ship bound for Pentos with a bag of silver to start a new life. Varys warns her that if she doesn't agree to the offer, she will be executed for her crimes, leaving her son orphaned.  Oathbreaker 15 Tyrion makes small talk with Grey Worm and Missandei.  Meanwhile, Tyrion passes the time by engaging Missandei and Grey Worm in small talk. Tyrion offers to play games with the pair but they are not interested. Before Tyrion can embark on a drinking game, Varys returns and informs them that the Wise Masters of Yunkai, the Good Masters of Astapor, and the Free City of Volantis have been secretly funding the Sons of the Harpy. While Grey Worm advocates attacking the cities, Missandei advises against it since that would leave Meereen unprotected. Using this information, Tyrion asks Varys to use his little birds to send them a message.  In Vaes Dothrak Oathbreaker 19 Daenerys enters the Temple of the Dosh khaleen.  Daenerys Targaryen walks with the Dothraki towards Vaes Dothrak and is ushered into the the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen by Khal Moro's bloodriders. The High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen orders the bloodriders to leave and strips Daenerys naked, giving her a robe which the dosh khaleen wear. As Daenerys puts on her new clothes, she tells the high priestess that she will soon regret what she has done as she was the wife of a great khal, the Queen of Meereen, and the Mother of Dragons. The high priestess retorts that she herself was the wife of a previous Great Khal, Savo. Just as Daenerys thought she would conquer the world at Drogo's side, so did the high priestess think she would conquer the world at Savo's. But Savo was slain, and she joined the dosh khaleen. She is now content, just as Daenerys would be in time, if she is in fact allowed to join them. When Dany expressed confusion, the priestess points out that khaleesi are supposed to return to Vaes Dothrak immediately after their khal's death... but Daenerys went out into the world. She explains that all the khalasars have gathered to decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved, and now they will have to decide what to do with Daenerys for not coming to the dosh khaleen after Khal Drogo died - allowing her to join the dosh khaleen being the best outcome.  In Braavos Oathbreaker 02 Arya trains with the Waif.  A blind Arya Stark resumes her training with the Waif and Jaqen H'ghar, the former of whom beats her repeatedly when she lies. Meanwhile, Jaqen has her mixing potions blindly. During her training, Arya continues sparring with the Waif while answering questions about her family and the Hound. Arya admits to leaving the Hound to die instead of killing him, despite wanting his death. The Waif then interrogates Arya about the people on her list: Cersei, Gregor Clegane and Walder Frey. The Waif voices her disbelief that Arya's list is so short, but Arya counters by asking which name she wants added. When Arya insists that she is no one, the Waif does not believe her and tries to hit her. However, Arya is able to deflect her blow and leap out of the way, surprising the Waif. After confirming that Arya has mastered blind sparring, Jaqen approaches Arya and offers to give back her sight if she tells him her name. Arya replies that \"a girl has no name.\" Jaqen then leads Arya to the well where he scoops up a bowl of water, which he offers her. She is reluctant, as others have drunk from it and died, but he says that if she is truly \"no one\" there is nothing to fear. Arya drinks from the bowl and her sight is restored. When Jaqen asks Arya who she is, she replies that she is no one.  At Winterfell The Umbers led by Smalljon Umber travel to Winterfell to meet Ramsay Bolton, the new Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. Smalljon and Ramsay chat about their experiences with their fathers. Smalljon mentions that his father Greatjon Umber is dead but admits that he would have killed him if the opportunity arose. Ramsay denies murdering the late Roose Bolton and claims that he was poisoned by his enemies, but Smalljon doesn't bother believing him.  Oathbreaker 21 Rickon returns home under a new rule.  Smalljon has come to forge an alliance with the Boltons against Jon Snow and the Wildlings. However, he refuses to bow to Ramsay; citing the late Robb Stark's betrayal at the hands of Roose. Smalljon then reveals that he has a \"gift\" for Ramsay, who asks if it is a girl, hoping for Sansa Stark. Smalljon replies otherwise and Umber guards enter the room with two hooded figures. The first turns out to be Osha \u2013 the second is Rickon Stark, Ned Stark's youngest child. Osha and Rickon appear uncomfortable to find themselves in Ramsay's presence. When Ramsay asks Smalljon to verify Rickon's identity, an Umber retainer enters the room carrying the severed head of the direwolf Shaggydog, and Rickon's expression of dismay confirms this was his pet. Satisfied, a gleeful Ramsay sarcastically welcomes Rickon home. "], "review": ["Every other answer on this question has termed it \"boring\". I don't know why. Maybe they all are book-readers and were expecting a lot from this episode and were disappointed. Yes, it didn't have much of plot advancement, or mad dragon fights or eerie zombie attacks, but I loved the episode.It had a lot of symbolism and deep philosophy.[SPOILERS from here]Ned StarkAll the viewers had believed that Ned was the only honourable man in the grey-world of GoT. We knew every character was a shade of grey, and there were no black or white characters. But, we had always thought Ned was the proper honourable person, and he even got beheaded for that.But, is Ned truly honourable?In his greatest fight, against the most famous knight, Ser Arthur Dayne, he says that he had defeated him.Was stabbing in the back honour?Was lying to his kids about it honour?But, when we think deeper about it. Howland Reed was the person to backstab. How would people react to that? And how would people treat Howland from then on? What would Meera think about her own father's lack of morality?So, Ned lied to protect Howland's respect. We also know that the whole of Westeros immensely respects Ser Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Would he receive the same respect by his fellow knights if they get to know that he was killed by a small knife by a cannogsman?So, Ned lied to protect Dayne's legacy.It was dishonourable to stab a person in the back. It was dishonourable to hide that fact. It was dishonourable to lie about it.But, it was honourable to do it to save others' respect and legacy. Even if they are your enemies, or friends.The choice of taking the dishonourable path to ensure honour, is a beautiful poetic event.Ned chose to lie. To save someone. Will he do it again? We shall wait and see.Jon SnowJon comes back from death, and Melisandre asks him what did he see in the great beyond.He says \"nothing\". He knows \"nothing\" about the afterlife.Ygritte had always said \"Jon Snow knows nothing\".In this episode, it is shown that \"Jon truly knows nothing\". Because he has been to the \"nothing\".Isn't that a beautiful play of words? Poetic indeed. Great writing.Another brilliant scene is the \"Execution\" of his murderers.You can clearly see the hesitation on Jon's face. He knows what they did was right, from their perspective. He also knows killing their Lord Commander is punishable by death.Even though he knows they are right, he knows that he is more right. He has seen the White Walkers' strength, and he knows he had to do what he had to do.Is executing men who are doing their own duty correct? Isn't loyalty to an organization more important than just taking orders? Is killing a child, even though is deluded and full of hatred, an honourable thing to do? Why do we have juvenile laws then? Would Jon not know that Olly is not mature enough to understand the bigger picture? Would Jon not know that Olly is consumed by hatred, consumed by guilt, and he did what he could do?But, is betrayal of a person and murdering him in cold blood a genuine excuse for the hatred inside you? Tough choices. Tough decisions. Tough circumstances.And we can see all this going through in Jon's head through his expressions. That moment of hesitation was truly great performance.Also, that one guy asks Jon to tell his Mother that he died doing the right thing. The only thing that matters to him, even at his death, is his Mother's approval. (A nice touch on Mother's Day)It shows that his whole childhood, his whole adulthood, his whole career with the Night's Watch has been to please his Mother. To show that even he is a good kid in front of his Mother's eyes. That sentiment is very deep. And he conveyed it beautifully in his one dialogue. Even the High Sparrow talks to Tommen about the beauty of mother-hood. (Mother's Day celebrations everywhere :D)Cersei Lannister The ultimate question still eludes me. Where does true power lie?When Robert was the King, the King had true power.After his death, the Small Council had true power.When Joffrey was King, the Hand, Tywin had true power.Then the Faith started getting power. (With Cersei's permission)Now, who has the true power? Not the King. Not the Faith. Not the Small Council. Not the Hand of the King. Who? What makes power yours? Official position one holds? One who commands a vast army? One who has the support of the masses? One who has his whisperers? Who?Cersei does not have an official position. Cersei does not have a vast army. Cersei does not have the support of the masses. Cersei is not even a Queen.Yet, Cersei holds the Power. Why? How? Kevan Lannister, the Hand of the King, controls the whole Lannister Army and the Gold Cloaks. Olenna Tyrell controls the whole of Reach and has the Queen herself as her grand-daughter. The High Sparrow controls the whole city's population and the downtrodden. Tommen, is the Official King.Yet, why do all bow down to Cersei? Power lies where all believe it to lie. Beautiful scene. It is better to storm out of the room and hide, than face Cersei.[END SPOILERS]You cannot expect every single episode to have a shocking twist, a mega-fight or dragons. You cannot expect every single episode to move the plot further. You cannot expect every single episode to be the best one you would ever see.You need to learn to handle your expectations.I personally think this episode was great. It had a lot of symbolism, lot of philosophical underpinnings, lots of depth and lots of psychology. (Varys' way of blackmail. Excellent) It had an excellent fight Dayne fight too. (7 vs 2) I don't know what more people can expect.I think most of the other answers here are the book-readers, who have read every single theory online and had a lot of expectations from this episode. (ToJ scene)Honestly, the TV show has done it better. Think from the perspective of a first time watcher, who has no intense researched background about all the theories. He first heard about Lyanna over five years ago, in the first episode, for ten seconds where they show her statue.And again in this season, in the first episode. You need to lay enough ground for them to truly absorb the intensity of the reveal.Honestly, most of the people still think Rhaegar had kidnapped and raped Lyanna. That is what the show has also told us till now. And I think the reveal has to be in bits and pieces, slowly going step-by-step and do a mega twist to shock the viewers.And it is just Episode 3 for god's sake. We still have 7 more weeks to go. So, no, the episode was not boring. It may not have captivating scenes, but if you watch closely and think about it, this is one of the deepest episodes out there.I LOVED THIS EPISODE. Giving it 4/5.Damn, I love this show.PS - One of the other review-writers of this question has just pinged me saying I didn't know what I was talking about. Haha. I read the previous episode reviews of all the other \"great\" answer writers here, and they did nothing but criticize. Every single episode!I mean, I don't know why they have this superiority complex and act so snobbish. They feel as if they were the true custodian of the books, and the show was just ripping it off. They honestly feel that the show is beneath them! And look at them whine in the comments. Gosh. That is too much negativity to handle. I mean, they assume everyone else is stupid and they act as if only they know what they are talking about, because, you know, \"books\"!Blah. These self-appointed Knights of ASOIAF trying to slay all the GoT Episodes is just pathetic. Lame. Lame. Lame. Sorry for the rant. ", "For D&D bitching that they're close to running out of material, to the point of not having enough to flesh out two more full seasons, they're perfectly happy to while away an entire episode without much of note happening.Castle Black: Jon's awakening was much more low-key than I was anticipating but it makes sense, I suppose, for him to be dazed and subdued. Luckily it looks like it won't last that long, if the Pink Letter comes like I think it will and say what I think it will. It felt wrong for Jon to hang the assassins instead of behead them, but Jon walking off felt natural even if you know it probably won't last (again, the Pink Letter and then if Sansa turns up I have a hard time believing Jon just listens to what happened to her without a reaction). Meereen: I just do not give a shit about Meereen. I don't. It amazes me that they got rid of a fairly intriguing fake-Aegon subplot in exchange for the Dornish clusterfuck and Varys getting what should be obvious intel out of someone based on Information From Somewhere. In the context of the show, how hard would it really be to figure out that three enemy cities might be bankrolling the guerrilla war in Meereen? Do we need Varys to figure that out? Am I supposed to be entertained when, for the millionth time, Grey Worm and Missandei don't \"get\" Tyrion's humor? Tower of Joy: The fight, even if for some crazy-ass reason was needlessly cut down in size (7 on 3 became 6 on 2 for reasons?), played out more or less like I figured it would. I'm sure GRRM's version, whenever we see it, will differ somewhat, but I'm comfortable enough to say that the \"Arthur Dayne is alive\" theory can probably be put out of its misery. I'm annoyed they cut away before the \"money shot,\" but counterintuitively, that extension might just reinforce how important R+L=J really is. They can really only afford to draw it out (unless they shit the bed plotwise, which is possible) if the payoff is big but also if the payoff actually affects the plot. The more drawn-out R+L=J is, as annoying as it is, the bigger it probably affects the overall plot beyond \"Rhaegar and Lyanna are Jon's parents, it means nothing, let's move on.\"Braavos: Arya finally made some progress and I'm guessing we move on to the theater troupe portion of her plot next, but I'm still waiting to see how Arya gets back to the main plot of the story and what impact her training will actually have. This is true in the books too; she's easily the hardest Stark to peg.King's Landing: I feel like they're getting dangerously close to wheel-spinning here. Cersei wants to kill people who mock her, Jaime's on her side for now, Tommen's not really sure what to do, the Faith is running roughshod over everything, can we get to the damn point already? Or at least get Jaime to the Riverlands where he actually does some interesting things? The Ship: I have nothing against Gilly except for the fact that she's yet another very minor character whose importance has been inflated. Makes sense to check in on them, I guess. Vaes Dothrak: I'm not sure what the show is going for here. Are we supposed to root for Dany to kill all these insolent Dothraki? Are we supposed to think it's unfair that Dany got to experience all the upsides of being Drogo's khaleesi without having to take any of the responsibility because she thinks it's beneath her? Or are we supposed to see it from the dosh khaleen's perspective that Dany's acting like an entitled, naive little pill? It's obvious what's going to happen: Drogon and Jorah and Daario will show up and save her and the Dothraki will be so awed by Drogon that they'll all follow her and yada yada yada. Rather than have to pay the piper as was expected of her, Dany gets to walk away scot-free as usual, because rules don't apply to her, see. It's all so stupidly predictable. Winterfell: I knew Umber's gift to Ramsay would be Rickon. I knew Ramsay would demand proof that it was Rickon and be given Shaggydog, either already dead or still alive but imminently dead. I don't know whether to be proud I correctly called it or mad that another direwolf is dead (one who's still alive in the books to boot). Rickon will probably feature in Ramsay's Pink Letter and it's probably part of what will motivate Jon to head south for Bastard Bowl. I get the change and I also suspect that Rickon may ultimately be sacrificed for either Jon's plot or Sansa's or both, where on the show they take over the Stark claim that Rickon might get in the books. Rickon looks headed in at least a somewhat different direction in the books, where he's on Skagos, with Osha and Shaggydog (who's, for now, still alive) and has Davos en route to him. Something tells me I'll like how the book handles it better ...ETA: I just remembered that Manderly tells Davos that he needs both Rickon and Shaggydog brought back from Skagos, to prove that Rickon is Rickon. So the grisly Umber's \"proof\" is sort of a nasty tweak on the book's plot, although in that case Manderly is obviously not wanting to kill the direwolf; he just needs Shaggydog with Rickon to prove his identity. Overall, not the best episode. I also don't have high hopes for next week after seeing the preview. :-/", "I bloody loved it!Series six is the first I've watched and so far I hadn't been convinced.\u00a0 Jon's resurrection was especially disappointing: my impression is that 'magic' is some kind of Roadrunner, ACME brand magic.\u00a0 Magic just happens and does stuff.Castle Black: or 'Davos has a potty mouth' - fine.Tower of Joy:\u00a0 interesting, not the scene, but the tree stuff afterwards.\u00a0 Bloodraven reckons he's been a tree for a thousand years.\u00a0 I get that being a tree could be boring, but that's quite a discrepancy: perhaps he just likes the numbers 1000 and 1001, I know I do.\u00a0 Another reference to Bran not being a tree forever: the main thing I took from episode 2 was the conversation between Meera and the 'Child of the Forest'.\u00a0 Child of the Forest #1 tells Meera that Bran will leave the cave and that he will need her then.\u00a0 How exciting.Ironborn:\u00a0 The Damphair sucks.\u00a0 His job is to be the grumpy old professor that doesn't think girls can do stuff.\u00a0 Little does he know that the Drowned God has signed up for the #heforshe Emma Watson UN campaign.\u00a0 Probably.\u00a0 From episode 2, Euron is a strange show construction: we are to believe that he's so crap that his crew had to strap him to his boat during a storm, yet the same crew passively allowed him to remove all their tongues.\u00a0 Bullshit.Meereen:\u00a0 Varys has the voice of Richard Briers reading Paddington Bear and a commendable belief in the blamelessness of children.\u00a0 Varys the Eunuch doesn't have children which may explain it.\u00a0 Tyrion has worked his way through the boxset of House MD, speaking and moving in exactly the same way as Hugh Laurie, but nowhere near as sarcastic and funny.the Dosh:\u00a0 Like the Golden Girls, the Dosh give hope to all women that they'll get more awesome with age, perhaps like Arbor Gold or a sour Dornish Red.\u00a0 Bit worrying that the Khals have fitted Dany onto the AGM for the next season of 'Dothraki's Next Top Pillage'.\u00a0 Hopefully, the Dosh will stage an intervention and overthrow the patriarchy with a convenient prophecy.\u00a0 The patriarchy is no match for a convenient prophecy.Braavos:\u00a0 Jaqen stands near a wall decoration that looks very much like a weirwood face.\u00a0 Could be feng shui, or\u00a0 he could have seen it in a magazine and had to have it.\u00a0 Nice.King's Landing:\u00a0 All the King's Council know about Ser Gregor, which is weird.\u00a0 Kevan is rubbish.\u00a0 The Queen of Thorns has forgotten to fuck off back to Highgarden in her wheelhouse with Left and Right.\u00a0 Where's her wheelhouse?\u00a0 Where the hell is Butterbumps?\u00a0 I tell you what: if the High Sparrow hasn't allowed for The Mountain that Frankensteins in the upcoming Trial of the Seven Death-match, then he's a tool.\u00a0 The 'little birds' have tongues, which again, is disappointing, but that enables them to do an Oliver, 'Please, Mr. Qyburn can we have some more (candied plums)?'\u00a0 Children in Westeros are being spoilt and not dying nearly enough...Winterfell:\u00a0 ...except for Rickon, whose chances I don't fancy at all.\u00a0 The sweary Umber dude (Benedict Umberdude?) fails to realise quite how much he has in common with the Wildings: the 'no fucking kneeling', describing Roose and Daddy Umberdude as a c-word (I don't like that one, so I'm not typing it).\u00a0 Rickon's couple of weeks in the wilderness have aged him hugely, from toddler to only slightly sub-teenager.Castle Black:\u00a0 Jon has Gloria Gaynor-ed his way out the door and will come to regret leaving his warm, raven-mantled cloak behind.\u00a0 Winter is coming and that's not sensible.Quick, someone bring Bloodraven a shrubbery!", "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606Boring. I mentioned this earlier and will have to say again that everything is just too easy. The characters don't really seem to grow, but change drastically with situations that they don't mould into. There is no drama where there should be: the brothers being tensed around each other and scuffles breaking out when Jon is dea- oh no wait he's alive, Arya being blind and being in impressive fight sequences while bl- oh wait she got her eyesight back, Ramsay living in constant fear while Sansa is away because of Roose who threatens to- oh hey Roose died. There's no anticipation, everything moves mindlessly towards something shocking, and as ever, Tyrion gets good lines that he absolutely does not need. Tower of Joy: I tried really hard to keep aside the status of legend this event has that the books have built up and just accept that the show decided it was not a big deal, but it was played down badly. Bran should have seen many more visions before he reached here, simply because he can see so much into the past and he would need to understand how important this vision is. If you are especially aware of what's in that tower and who the screaming woman was, you will think that this needed to be built up. But well, let's assume it wasn't a big deal, you'd still want Ned's obsession with honor and righteousness to be stressed a little bit more (Sean Bean has been dead for what, six years now?) before showing how Howland Reed stabbed probably the greatest swordsman of the time in the back. This was my favorite part of the scene, by the way. It showed that whatever Ned was going for made him so desperate that he was willing to put aside honor and actually kill Arthur Dayne any way possible. That's a very very important clue stressing just how important this small battle was. Of course, they butchered the whole scene. Braavos: I really wished she had become more skilled before she regained her sight back. I mean, I'm sure she has, but we didn't get to see it. Also, they're trying so hard to get her to forget Arya Stark and become No One, and yet, inexplicably, she's talking about the Lannisters and her brothers and her list. And promptly gets her sight back. It's confusing. King's Landing: I love that Olenna Tyrell is back. The lady is a pleasure to listen to. Also the semi-reveal that the thing in the armor is Gregor Clegane aka the Mountain was dropped a little too casually. The turn of events at the Small Council was fun to watch, and the High Sparrow seemingly converting Tommen to his side was unexpected and delightful. The ladies are going to lose it.Sam/Gilly: It was good seeing them after a while. Good to know she's going to Horn Hill. But what's she gonna do? Where is she gonna live? What will her identity be? Mereen: Meh. Why does Tyrion need so many empty lines! It does nothing for the story. Who Varys's \"little birds\" are was a fun reveal. Vaes Dothrak: They're gonna decide what to do with Dany since she didn't turn up there as soon as Khal Drogo died. Fair enough. Winterfell: I liked Smalljon Umber! The mutual back scratching arrangement is practical enough, and I'm just glad it wasn't Rickon's head as I was expecting last week. Poor Shaggydog though.Castle Black: Jon did the right thing by killing those who betrayed him, of course. I can't really decide if his cavalier manner of declaring that his watch has ended was underwhelming or brilliant. Technically, having died, his watch actually has ended and he's no longer bound by the vows he made to the Watch. I wish he had explained more. Considering he knows what's beyond the Wall, it seems very out of character for him to suddenly abandon his post and walk away. It looks like he's marching towards Winterfell now, possibly with the Wildlings. Melisandre did see him in the fire battling at Winterfell. Jon Snow vs Ramsay Bolton would be something to look forward to. Can't really say the same for the next episode, judging by the preview. ", "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606In a word, boring. Barely anything happened for most of the episode.Spoilers if you haven't watched Season 6, Episode 3 yet. (Image Source: THE TOWER OF JOY: An Adaptation)Let's start with the most awaited sequence first - the Tower of Joy. Or rather, judging from the un-watchtower-like structure, the Joyfort. Why was it so hard for them to stage a 7-vs-3 fight like in the books, instead of showing a 6-vs-2? Book fans have discussed to death what Eddard's words \"if not for Howland\" were supposed to mean, but it was just a plain old backstab. I'm sure the book version will be better. It has to be. And then they are just dragging out the Lyanna reveal. Arya's training montage was the one decent in this episode, which isn't saying much. The point of making Arya blind was that she can learn to use her other senses, and she does - hearing the footsteps and smelling those powders. I know it was silly of me to look for that cat, but I was hoping for something dramatic to happen before Arya earns her sight back. I guess Arya is going to be given another contract.Jon's scenes were a distant second, when it comes to the watchable (or perhaps rewatchable) scenes in this episode. He does a good job becoming dazed at the turn of events, and it was disappointing that he remembers everything - what was the cost for his return? And Melisandre throws in the phrase, the Prince who was promised. The execution scene was mostly satisfying, from a justice point of view that is, but I would have preferred beheadings. The man who passes the sentence and all that (though I suppose Jon did swing his sword at the elaborate rope-barrel contraption). Jon's watch ending, as he claims it, felt underwhelming - I couldn't really understand why he doesn't want to do it any more, now that he has taken care of those who murdered him for doing what he thought was right. Maybe that's the cost?Things are starting to happen in other places - In Meereen, with Varys giving us the names of the three closest cities to Meereen, and a few minutes of wasted screentime with Tyrion; At Vaes Dothrak, Dany gets a somewhat sympathetic welcome by the surprisingly young group of the dosh khaleen after they stripped her and gave her Dothraki garb. Sam and Gilly are on a ship to Oldtown... or really Horn Hill, and I'd like to see the itinerary where they can get to Horn Hill without going through Oldtown. King's Landing was a series of conversations - Qyburn buying the loyalty of Varys' little birds (who have tongues in the show) with candied plums (I think) from Dorne, Cersei and Jaime take a tour with Robert at their backs, first visiting Qyburn and then got to watch a small Small Council walk out on them, and Tommen finds a new grandfather to listen to.Finally, Winterfell. I've decided that I like Smalljon for now, who is a lot smaller than his book counterpart. His line of thinking is convincingly straightforward - if he had to choose between an army of wildlings, or making common cause with someone like Ramsay, it's an easy choice for him. But betraying the son of his former liege lord seems a bit extreme, and I half-believe that he was laying it on thick when he spoke about wanting to kill his father (who is supposedly dead now). And poor Shaggydog, I hope he died a better death than Grey Wind, at least the latter's butchery was on-screen.Overall, this episode was the worst of the three so far, but not by a lot. 5/10.", "Slow paced with nothing much happening of note.To pick each storyline for the review:Castle Black - Jon Snow delivering swift justice to mutineers was something I personally didn't expected. I was hoping that he would be able to persuade Ser Alliser to join his cause and take the post of commander, as his leaving the post was always on the cards. Would have felt hurried, sure, but that wouldn't be the first time on the show. Jon seemed tired and aged beyond his years and that made sense as his sense of betrayel is still raw. He would be back in his fighter self soon as other storylines are merging - Sansa (like Alys Karstark) is approaching Castle Black and Rickon is the new ManceWinterfell - One thing I liked about the scene was that Smalljon cut Ramsay to his size. But seeing severed head of Shaggydog hurt. Best case scenario for Rickon is that Ramsay will make him a cloak of Osha skin (substituting him and Osha for Mance and spear wives). Other scenarios are not at all good for him. One thing surprising is that Smalljon said that they are most north than any one else and Osha and Rickon were going southwards towards White Harbour (in Manderley's region). So how did they end up being captured by Umbers?Bran and his visions - This part was completely underwhelming. Why the decision to reduce both parties by 1 at Tower of Joy? Was it to show the skill of Dayne when he fought with 4 opponents at once and just 3 people taking out Ser Hightower and Ser Whent would have been too much? But I really doubt if show producers care about that. The fight sequence was also not great or exciting to watch. The decision to kill Dayne by stabbing him from behind was also strange to me. Was it done to reinforce the skill of Ser Arthur Dayne who couldn't have been killed in a fair fight by multiple combatants? So many questions!!!Dawn was sacrificed as well for the sake of spectacle of Ser Dayne fighting with multiple people. Sam and Gilly - They are in transit making their way to Horn Hill and show!Gilly is 100x more perky than the Book!Gilly. At least she is getting some happiness in her lifeArya Stark - To me it was the strongest part of the episode. The editing successfully gives an idea of time passing with each session Arya had with the waif and how she is learning and getting stronger. The kill list is now really short though!!!King's Landing - Second strongest part with Cersei doing what she does best. She is not the subdued book!Cersei which Kevan meets in the final chapter of last book but fierce show!Cersei who is out for blood and vengance. Jamie seems confused and startled with so much going around and is just following Cersei around. High Sparrow showed his gift with words and a young and impressionable Tommen can be persuaded to give Faith a upper hand over crown unless Cersei strikes soonMeeren - Boring and awful. Tyrion quipps doesn't amuse. Varys is not imposing, mysterious, or threatening. Missandei and Grey Worm can as well be the furniture in the room. And what are the dragons doing now? They have been freed, surely a dialogue could have been put in between to let the viewers know about their whereaboutsVaes Dothrak - I guess show runners want Dany to be disliked in a different way in show as compared to books. They are going to make her incredibly thick and dumb. Why does she keep repeating to every Dothraki she meets that she is the mother of dragons and first of her name and Queen of Meereen and best thing to happen since sliced bread and what not. They don't give a rat's ass. She has lived among them and she must know that. And that's what is happening. They hear her, then they laugh at her and ridicule her. Is the sole purpose of these events to create a platform from which Dany will avenge her humiliation? So that viewers will cheer for Dany when Drogon will finally appear? For now, this arc is just idiotic.", "Note: I\u2019m reviewing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from the perspective of someone who has read all of George R.R. Martin\u2019s novels and watched the All episodes of Game of Thrones (TV series).\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Why? - It wasn't exciting an episode as the last couple.There are lot more reviews in details So, I am summing up mine in couple of paragraphys:While this wasn\u2019t as exciting an episode as the last couple, it was still packed with goodies. Seeing Jon Snow back from the dead answers some questions and opens the doors for others. Bran\u2019s vision was probably the most exciting moment of the episode for me, though I wish they\u2019d actually made Ser Arthur Dayne\u2019s sword, Dawn, more exciting. Oh well.We\u2019re moving just barely forward at this point in the season, and three episodes deep the wheels are still turning very slowly. The tension in King\u2019s Landing is sure to mount now that the Queen of Thornes is here. Jon and Ramsay will almost certainly go to war now. And I suspect that her allies will attempt to free Daenerys soon as well. Perhaps war will also come to Meereen, and Dorne will raise its banners. More war, more clashing of kings and queens and so forth.Whatever happens, it hasn\u2019t happened yet. The season has been full of revelations, but things are still building. That\u2019s okay. I love the tension and not knowing exactly what\u2019s coming. And I guess that's waht kept/keeps us hoohked up with Game of Thrones (TV series) so far.Thanks for A2A Monu Kamble.", "(Show Spoilers) The theme of oathbreaker ran through the episode, but it was more apparent in some storylines than others. The episode tried to move key plot lines along, which seems to be the concern of the show creators as they are doing their best to complete the story. Of the three episodes in the season, this felt the least satisfying, even though there were no outright blunders, just annoyances and some gems as well.The Best:Jon Snow: Yes, the resurrection was underwhelming, but the show made up for that with a moving portrayal of a man murdered and returned from the dead. Jon is in shock. He cannot believe his brothers murdered him for doing what he felt was right. Davos served as a father figure to him, helping him transition into a world where he doesn't know where he belongs. Melissandre all but called him \"the Prince that was promised\", telling Jon that Stannis was not who she thought he was. It was good to see Jon connect with his loyal friends, Doloros Edd and of course, Tormund. The ending of the show gave dignity to Alliser Thorne. Like him or not, the man knew who he was, a man of the Night's Watch. How many of us would be so sure of our life's path as he was, as he faced his end? And as many predicted, Jon's watch now has ended. I would have liked more\u00a0 of Jon Snow's story--that made me realize that the show had done well by him.. They just wanted to get the resurrection done so they could get back to telling his story. The Rest: Varys: We had the image of \"little birds\" beginning with him and concluding with a very sinister Qyburn. Varys was great as he worked with the prostitute who killed Unsullied, and worked for the Sons of the Harpy. We realized that Varys gets what he wants because as he tells the woman, he likes to make people happy. He tells Tyrion which cities is funding the guerrilla movement (Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis), but either he is choosing not to reveal the leader or he does not know. The Tyrion scene felt obligatory, as though we needed some humor that just felt out of place, but it served to show that Tyrion really isn't all that comfortable in Meereen, nor do the rest of Dany's circle seem to know what to do with him. Tower of Joy: I liked seeing Bran reach out to his father as he climbed up to the tower. Did Ned hear him? And wasn't that a baby crying? The show does not want us to think that Ser Arthur Dayne is actually alive as some do believe. Instead of Dawn, we had General Grievous lightsabers killing off every Northman we could see, save Ned of course, who knew he didn't stand a chance against Ser Arthur. The show has only introduced two major swords: Ice and Longclaw, so it was no surprise that we didn't get to see Dawn, but the sword double action struck me as a poor substitute. Still, Bran was obviously shocked that his father won, even though he had heard the story so many times, and I won't spoil that part.Ramsay: Well, many of us guessed the gift was Rickon and wondered why House Umber would turn traitor. As usual, I overthought it, looking through dialogue between the Greatjon and Robb, wondering about his connection to the Karstarks, along with the power motivations within the Umbers. So it turns out that the Smalljon is worried about the Wildings. (I chuckled.) He is also worried about Jon Snow. So he is willing to talk terms with Ramsay about his concern for his lands. I didn't see that one coming, as I gave House Umber more credit as fighters--really, that was very dissatisfying. The shock for me was Shaggydog. I spent too much time coming up with possible reasons for their betrayal, and not enough thought about their viciousness. The North truly has forgotten, as far as the show is concerned.Arya: The plot has gotten to the point where Arya is now possibly ready to become \"no one\". I did enjoy her fight scenes and I was reminded how much I miss the Arya from other seasons. A girl has been given a second chance to fulfill her promise,\u00a0 and basically that is what we saw. Daenarys: I was hoping for some prophesy or sense of the future, but as usual, Dany goes somewhere to find out that she may not stay there for long. I am surprised we are on episode 3 and Dany has not found her way back to Meereen, but I believe the show will reveal something that matters for her storyline in the next episode. She is with the Dothraki for a reason, and I don't just mean in terms of plot, but I figure they will somehow assist her in her return back to Meereen or we are going to see some Drogo awesomeness along with some Jorah/Daario action.We got an introduction to Sam again, and Oldtown, plus a promise to get to know the Tarly family. Mace Tyrell asked his mother to sit on the small council, Uncle Kevan is back and Jaime insisted that he belongs on the small council too. Families and politics. As an American, I wondered if I was watching a session of Congress as everyone save Cersei, Jaime and Ser Robert Strong walked out. Meanwhile the king is getting schooled on religion from a man who reminds him of Tywin--that was interesting. The oathbreaker theme only seems to pertain directly to two sections: Jon Snow with the Night's Watch, and the various traitors in Winterfell.\u00a0 It has some relevance to Ayra.Perhaps Dany broke an oath by choosing to be a queen instead of a widow shut away by the Dothraki, but there I go overthinking again. In all, the episodehad some strong points, and I like what they are doing with Bran and Jon, but as episodes go, it was uneven at best.", "Hm. I feel almost bad saying it among the bad reviews. Maybe I just don't have any taste or the bar's been set so low that I don't expect much but I liked it. Especially the Castle Black scenes.Segment by segment: I liked the scenes at the wall. I could complain, but there's no point. Jon leaving the wall, predicted by many, was well done. I liked seeing Olly and Alliser Thorne dead. They looked comical. And I like comedy. Yes, all the rough edges that make characters like Tormund Thunderfart and Dolorous Edd interesting in the book have been sanded off...but, like, three years ago, so I'm used to it.I liked seeing Sam. He's becoming one of my favorite show characters, maybe because he's not too far from the book. I also think the actress that pays Gilly is a cutie pie.Arya: it happened pretty much as I predicted but I liked it well enough. Again, I'm so used to the edges being sanded off that it doesn't bother me. To be honest, the only thing that pisses me off is pseudo-hipster lines like Cersei's monologue in Episode 1 about her dead mother. So terrible. The D's probably think it's sheer poetry. Dany was treading water but it was OK, we didn't see her last episode. Varys scene was well-played. Attractive actress.\u00a0 They've butchered book Varys with the same cleaver they've butchered book Tyrion, but, again, I've long since stopped raging.Tyrion Missandei and Greyworm bit didn't really do it for me, but at least there was no love scene and Peter Dinklage got to play nervous, which is better than playing a know-it-all saint.Cersei and Jaime always bore me, but I liked the Tommen/High Septon meeting. I felt there is a quality to the Tommen actor that I found touching. He looks just like one of my students, that probably helps.Umber/Bolton scene was utterly predictable but I still was like OH MAN.", "It was an okay episode, I'd give it 2.5/5.Tower of Joy:One of the most important scenes in the story. Book readers have analysed every word of it in ridiculous manners, and it is good to see many theories like Dayne being alive, or Reed talking him out of it resting in peace. I loved the scene, the 2 vs 6 doesn't bother me at all. Ser Arthur Dayne was excellent, the choreography was excellent, and the tease for Lyanna conveys the importance of this scene. Also, we got to see \"winds speaking\".Castle Black:Somehow Jon's resurrection doesn't seem to have much weight. There should be some sacrifice, he shouldn't be back whole. Resurrection is a shady territory even in fantasy. And him casually rejecting the Night's Watch really felt out of character. Why would he end his watch when he knows the great threat, and that he is needed here to combat it? He rejected Stannis' offer, and now for no reason his watch is ended. It makes more sense if next week he receives the pink letter mentioning Rickon in a cloak in a cage and then goes berserk.Bastardbowl is almost confirmed. A Bolton-Umber against the Watch-Wilding alliance, with Jon Snow on a horse. And Peter Baelish pulling a Gandalf on this Helms Deep with his Vale forces. Meereen:The Varys scenes were brilliant. They reminded of the good old times when we intently listened to the dialogues and not drool over shock-events. Mentions of Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis make one prediction more strong - of the oncoming war between Meereen and Astapor-Yunkai. I hope Tyrion leads the troops like Barristan does in the books. As for Volantis, Daenerys is going to stop there for a while before her final journey to Westeros, and you are not going to like it.Winterfell:Smalljon was good. He was tall, bear-like, and unapologetic \"your father was a cunt\". He was also an idiot. It is easy choice to make between wildings and a Northern house. But there are other ways to get help other than giving away the greatest asset you have in your hands. The Umbers could have done a lot with a boy Stark. And gift or not, the Boltons were definitely going to attack Jon Snow. The gift was a huge unnecessary waste by the Umbers.And Ramsay is so lucky, he got two Starks delivered to him for free! He had zero effort in both, and the delivery people got nothing in return. He actually shouldn't have lasted this long. Without Roose and Sansa, the Northerners would've baked him into a pie and be fighting over who'd take the Bolton lands.Kings Landing:Mention of the Hound in Braavos. Cersei talks about Trial by Combat. Ian Mcshane letting off the secrets. You know what is coming. ", "My watch has ended - Jon SnowI liked both episodes 1 and 2, but this felt like it finally had some momentum to start getting the story properly moving. I still feel like Arya and Dany's storying a boring me to tears. Everything which has happened for Dany so far could've been covered over in one episode, and likewise Arya, though I understand taking their time with the eyesight stuff.The Bran scene was great. I find it interesting that people keep saying that means R+L=J. Why? Sure, R+L=baby, but why Jon? I'm pretty sure it's Danaerys. I'm not sure why they thought they needed only two Kingsguard at the tower? And who was the other guy? Was it Whent or Hightower? I was also hoping for Arthur to throw some shade Ned's way about him being in love with Ashara, not being good enough for her, and making a comment about him having married Catelyn (which would've made for a fun awkward moment with Whent, given he's Catelyn's cousin).I was a bit shocked when they started calling the mountain Ser Gregor, rather than Ser Robert Strong, but in that Prince Doran is dead, and Dorne is already poised at war against them, why the charade. It took me a bit to realise why they were unailingly explicit about it. Bit of a shame, though, since it's pretty obvious in the book, it's kind of a blatant unsaid, because nobody wants to acknowledge it.I liked Jon's confusion and continued pain throughout. And I liked his disembarkment at the end. I just didn't like the two scenes being separated. What purpose did that serve? I realise that each episode seems to be top and tailed with the Wall, but I just would prefer more movement elsewhere.I'm unclear how long Sam and Gilly have been at sea, but it's a bit of a dick move telling her after all this time that he's dumping her with his mum and sister while he goes off to the citadel. I wonder if this is a way for the show to delay going to Oldtown, so we don't get any Euron-Samwell clash until season 8?I had expected Rickon back this season, and was very pleased they got the same actor Art Parkinson, but damn he got tall! In the books, he should only be 6-7 by now. The actor's 14, so it's yet another departure. But that aside, I really hope they don't kill of Rickon. I mean, seriously, he's one of my favourite book characters. Being on the Isle of Skagos should make him crazy. It doesn't seem impossible to go that route with the show, but killing off shaggy dog makes me skeptical.My greatest criticism, though, is just how disparate the storylines are now. The cohesion the show once had is gone, and there's no fluidity between moving between scenes. The only exception to this was Bran saying \"what would I see in that tower\" and the next thing you see is Dany. If I'm right about her parentage, that's a great hint.", "Spoliers..........A major flaw of this season so far has been that the showmakers have been trying to cram too much into each episode thus making each episode more or less a bundle of unsatisfying plots. This is in addition to a lack of dramatization and imagnation. Episode 3 was no exception.The thought process was good tying the title with the present and past actions of key characters, Ned, Jon, Danny etc. however the execution has not been right again due to plots that are both less interesting as well as lacking dramatization.IMO Bloodraven's character has become all about stretching the show, something that has not been necessary in the past. Are the show makers running out of plot material?The scene where Sam and Gilly are sailing IMO was totally unecessary. One might argue that Sam's an oathbreaker too and that may be right but that scene is still is a misfit. The scenes in Mereen were lackluster as well. We are used to see much more from the characters of Varys and Tyrion. What we got was them trying to make the best out of a rather bland plot.Arya's transformation into no one could not have been less dramatic. I wish her transition was shown more in detail. The only thing in the episode worthy of notice was the ending, where Jon resigns as Lord Commander and coldly declares that his watch has ended. Not too many may care about it, but to me it was bad ass.", "Lets be quick and finish it off instead of garnishing it with unnecessary fillers like the producers have.\u00a0 Margery will face a trail, much like Cersie had but unlike Cersie, she has both the Tyrells and Lannisters holding her back. I am expecting an alliance in the near future. Meanwhile, I expect Tommen to turn to the ways of the High Sparrow, considering the dedication and attention with he was listening to his humongous preaching. How can you be so calm in front of the man who has made your mother walk the streets naked in the name of \"atonement\"?Meanwhile, Cersie and Jamie try their best to wriggle their arses into the king's council. However, Ollena and others have made it clear that they are wanted no more. Man the Lannisters are having a hard time. I so miss Tywin, sigh.Khaleesi reaches Vaes Dothrak, once again. She must escape these brutes who want her to spend the rest of her days repenting in the Khalar Vezhven. And then she begins her introduction. Yawn! Its high time you do something, Khaleesi.I am even disappointed with the Tower of Joy scene albeit the part when Ned does pause for a moment as Bran calls him from behind. We all know where this is heading, where Ned  is heading when we hear Lynna wincing in the pain of, childbirth? We will probably have to endure the drag through a few more episodes before we get to the root of Jon's parentage. But that it is happening in this season is for sure, or maybe they will end this season with this very cliffhanger.My breath did get stuck in my throat when I saw Rickon and Osha. Not to mention Shaggydog's decapitated head offered to Lord Bolton, the new one,mind you. Strikes odd, doesn't it? Lady is dead. Nymeria is dead or alive:Schrodinger's Cat. Greywind was slayed during the Red Wedding. Summer is snug within the caves along with Bran. And Ghost? Standing tall and strong. After all, whose dire wolf is it at the end of the day?We know Vala has been captured. Varys threatens a woman with her child in his own cunning way. The scene featuring the Tyrio was b-o-r-i-n-g. Like Tyrion, I was getting damn bored.Finally, we know who fed information to the Sons of Harpy and a great deal yet about their sources of finance. And who did the same to Varys. Little birds?Where?All I see is innocent kids hungry for love roaming the streets. Now that, is a pleasant surprise indeed.And now the ONLY scene that crosses the bar of expectations laid down for us since s06e02: the Lord Commander wakes up. Probably he wasn't as familiar with the idea of his resurrection as we were. Took him a while to absorb so much. I loved the way Ghost, ever affectionately, held his breath as Jon woke up. Never seen so much love among any two people in entire GOT. It is beauty to see Jon parading through the Wildlings, embracing Tommun and his friend, and even as he winces, we wince. We can't afford to lose him once more. Enough torment have we endured. He conviction of his Killers(Esp. Alliser Thornes and the prick Olly) didn't come much of a surprise to me. What was a surprise was Jon's head held high, dapper walk-away from the Night's Watch. What can the impotent death do when the Lord Commander himself renounces his vows. Jon so alleviates my fears in this gestures of his.cHe is hurt the most where Ollie has stabbed him, in the heart and his wounds haven't even healed yet. But he walks away. Punishing all those who had betrayed the Lord Commander. Renouncing his vows. Delegating his responsibilities.Wear it, burn it.My watch is ended.(Loosely translated to \"Deal with your shit yourself from now on.\")Loved watching Jon finally executing what is best for himself .Finally! We see Samwell and Gilly after what seems like an eternity. Through a brief storm ride, the producers have told us that both of them are headed to the Citadel but Sam plans to drop Gilly and their baby off to his place. They are headed south. Away from North when Jon resides? A reunion is far out of sight, for now.All in all, a pretty average episode but I'll cut it some slack considering our expectations are on cloud 9 since the last episode. Also, I feel instead of feeding us tidbits in the name of plot advancement, the producers should focus on one or two story lines per episodes and give us a decent treat, enough to last for one week.A decent 3/5 for me.", "Well Well , the episode's not out yet and boy aren't we waiting already!I'll write what I feel based on the preview and will definetely do a complete review once I'm done watching the episode.First things first , Jon is back.( The Red Woman , we LOVE you now ) The moment we waited for is finally here :D I am waiting to see the shock on some people's faces and what Jon decides to do to them.Secondly\u00a0 Brian's vision + Tower of Joy , well its time to get our hands on some secrets regarding Stark family.Maybe we'd finally learn about the famous fan theory R + L = J 's validity.Thirdly what happens when the dragons are unleashed :PSo hold on to your seatbelts cause the ride has just taken off :)Edit :Well the episode had a slow pace attached to it.Jon Snow :Jon is back and how. He's out and ready to punish the ones who tried killing him. I particularly feel for Snow as Olly still gives him angry looks when he's up there hanging. The best part\u00a0 of the entire episode 'Wear it , watch it , castle black is yours , my watch has ended'Tower of joy : Brian has the visions of the fights which have a changed version as compared to the book. Nothing spectular.Mereen : I had hoped that there would be some action in terms of dragons well no , people at Mereen are figuring out other stuff and Tyrion tries\u00a0 playing drinking games.Winterfell : Ramsay in control of the situation after killing dad and now wants to be proclaimed as the Warden of the North.Arya Stark : Finally her training pays off as she regains her eyesight as well as now has stronger senses. She is no one.All in all there are a lot of things waiting to be told. And all we gotta do is let it all Build-up! Fin!", "This week's episode wasn't firing on all cylinders the way last week's was, but it was still an okay episode overall.In particular, I thought Jon's storyline was well-handled. Kudos to Kit Harrington for that initial scene, because it really was one of his better pieces of acting. He did an excellent job of portraying how unsettling and unnerving it would be to return from the dead remembering your own murder. Likewise, Melisandre was also strong in that scene, with her desperate questioning of Jon about the afterlife and fervent urging that someone must be Azor Ahai (pretty clearly Jon at this point).The concluding execution scene was probably my favorite of the episode. I really like what the show has done with Alliser Thorne; far from the straight-up jerk he was in the books, Show!Alliser has been portrayed in the last few seasons as a short-sighted but principled man who disagrees with Jon and acts on it. His final words were a perfect conclusion to that arc and very satisfying overall. I was scared for a moment that Jon was going to have mercy and cut Olly down. I'm glad he didn't - we needed to see that death has changed Jon. And like many have speculated in the past few months, Jon's watch has ended.The next-best scene was the long-awaited (and sadly incomplete) Tower of Joy scene. I wish they had kept the dialogue from the books between Ned and the Kingsguard, but on the whole the scene was still satisfying. Arthur Dayne was fun to watch, and Bran's commentary made the scene more enjoyable, in my eyes - there's nothing this show does better than strip away innocence. I should have known better than to think that we'd get to see the inside of the Tower of Joy, but it was still enjoyable.The rest of the episode was varying degrees of interesting: I'm really over Cersei trying to be Tywin, though I did love Kevan just up and leaving her when she tried to force her way into the Small Council meeting.Relatedly, Dorne got mentioned and now I'm terrified that Dorne is not over.As much as I love Tyrion, the extended scene between him, Grey Worm and Missandei was wholly unnecessary.After showing some promising signs of growing a backbone, Tommen almost immediately caved to the High Sparrow in conversation - I don't see this ending well.I asked where Sam and Gilly were last week, and now I regret it.Poor Shaggydog. I'm sure I don't like where the North is headed.Arya is one \"Eye of the Tiger\" short of a training montage. But she has her sight back now, so that's something. Other than Jon's scenes and the Tower of Joy, the only other scene I can say I definitely enjoyed was watching Varys in action. We've known for a while that Varys wields a lot of power and leverage, but I really liked him in action. I found him quite threatening and ominous in this scene, and I look forward to more like it.To be honest, I was hoping for more Sansa/Brienne this week, but was disappointed. Thankfully, it looks like she'll be back next week - along with Baelish (finally!). I'm ready to put this episode behind me as the first truly mediocre one of the season and get excited for whatever we're about to see in episode four.(Originally posted on my personal blog)", "I watch every episode twice before sleeping except today. The new format of Show all plot lines for few mins is not working with me. On top of it this seasons main problem is everyone's changed. There was an emotional connect with every character until this season. Cersei changed, Jon Snow changed, Jaime changed, Mellisandre changed, Davos changed and every other character we knew is dead. I don't give a shit about Dany and the Meeren, such a waste of Tyrion and Varys and screen time. Even though it is Young Ned Stark we see, there was no emotional connection. They should\u00a0 have retained Sean Bean itself. Arya's been doing same shit again. Liked the Hound part, though. Why exactly Waif and Jaquen are trying to asses her relationship with Hound? This is the second time. Osha and Rickon - good to see them and sad to see poor shaggy dog. The betrayal of Umbers is not appealing and I don't care about Karstarks and Umbers. At this point of time in books, the only interesting and rooting plot line is the North. The show made it less interesting.The stretching should stop right now before it snaps instead of winding.\u00a0 ", "OMG the Tower of Joy flashback is moving so slowly!\u00a0 Although I had to wonder:\u00a0 what does it say about Ned that he could never tell the true story of how Sir Arthur Dayne died?\u00a0 I have this feeling we'll see Ned walking down the stairs (with or without baby, depending) and not the room or Lyanna.\u00a0 I get Bran's frustration, that's actually the most interesting story line right now.\u00a0 The actor playing Bran is doing a terrific job with all of the nuances.The Arya storyline is moving along nicely and quicker than I feel it would have in past seasons.I get why Ollie hated Jon until the bitter end, plus I don't think that Jon would have been able to cut that rope had Ollie asked for forgiveness.\u00a0 I don't think a single solitary person was surprised when he handed his cloak and said my watch is done.\u00a0 At this point I'm going to say that I've either watched the episodes too many times or the program is becoming predictable?\u00a0 Rickon delivered to Ramsay, Mellisandre resurrecting Jon, Jon walking away from the Wall with \"my watch is over\" ...\u00a0 all seemed like the most obvious things to happen.Dani gets to the Khal-widow-group and is not readily accepted.\u00a0 No time for a \"Hey, my name is Dani and I've walked through fire.\u00a0 You?\" before she is stripped, put in a brown burlap sack and told that she is not automatically in and there will be meetings and votes and arguments about her.\u00a0 She'll be plotting and scheming the whole time and my guess is that she'll end up with at least some Dothraki support.Rickon & Shaggydog, my heart is broken.\u00a0 Hurry, Jon, hurry.Tyrion without dragons is boring now.\u00a0 The Lannister twins may have overplayed their hands. No one seems very scared of them, or worried about offending them.\u00a0 Tommen .... WTH was that about?\u00a0 He's so impressionable, Jamie best start influencing that kid before the High Sparrow wins both Tommen & Margeary over.\u00a0 I love Olenna and I love Olenna, most of all I love Olenna.\u00a0 Please stay.  And that's my very first GoT review.\u00a0 Hurry, Jon, you & Ghost need to hurry!", "Boring. Wasted an episode saying stuff we already knew. They didnt even show Lyanna in the Tower, the fight was hokie (Arthur Dayne used one famous sword not two, nobody dual wields long swords)Jon's resurrection is still being treated underwhelmingly even by him. He should should be freaking out. Only one person had a semi proper response to him being alive, the first traitor on the gallows.The only interesting thing was Umber returning Rickon, which is also stupid because the first thing Ramsay would do would be slit his throat.\u00a0 If he doesn't its just a move to fill plot holes which is even worse.At least they brought Olenna back so now something might actually move along in Kings Landing instead of watching the wicked witch of the west pretend to have feelings.There's nothing even happening on the show this season that isnt surprising and the way they are beating square plot hole pegs thru round holes is starting to get tiresome.", "If GoT were an anime, this would be a filler episode. Dull, slow, and uninteresting.CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD!Not a single major revelation about all that has been left unsaid.They've pushed Lyanna to the next (maybe even further) episode.What is up with Jon \"i-cant-do-this-job-anymore\" Snow?!?The High Sparrow sure is sucking up to Tommen. That Cersei is planning to demand a trial-by-combat, is all we know.No significant plot progress with Daenerys either.When will Bran Stark start learning something?Gilly, Sam, and Sam Jr. are still traveling.The only point of interest that made me feel better is that Arya's eyes are back. Nonetheless, the possibility that Arya has finally accepted that she truly is \"No One\" . I liked Arya.I've got a very fishy feeling about Jon Snow, though. There's definitely more to him than he's letting on.", "I said this about the previous episodes, I will say it about this one.Nothing much happened. Or perhaps I'm wrong? Perhaps too much is happening, with not enough pomp to celebrate its import?There is a lot which I liked about this episode, but more that I didn'tTower of JoySer Arthur Dayne is fantastic! I have no idea why Ser Gerold Hightower wasn't there, but Arthur Dayne made up for it by singlehandedly handing half a dozen men their asses. Wonder why Jaime was never inspired to dual wield like Ser Dayne. He was the type...But the punchline was weak. With Eddard disarmed, Howland just stabs Dayne it the throat, and it's done. If that's all it took, Ned would have remembered it for us. Yes, I never thought Lyanna would be shown right now. There is a lot of power in that reveal, and no doubt the producers wanted to present it with deep impact. Not to mention, they must have been hoping to give GRRM as much time as they could before the big reveal. Bran is... progressing slowly, considering we've not seen him for over a year.Castle BlackTo quote Emperor Palpatine, \"Everything is going as I had forseen\". Here at least. Jon is shaken by his experience, and Kit Harrington has shown that vulnerable side well. His execution of the conspirators was very conspicuously different from last season's beheading. His \"And now my watch is ended\", while not wholly unexpected, throws a wrench in a lot of things. Like Edd. After all he went through, Jon abandons the Wall? What'll happen now? But the stage is being set for the Battle of the Bastards.Vaes DothrakIt always amazes me how Dany just... expects stuff to go her way all the time. Threatening the Dosh Khaleen, rattling off her many titles, like as though they mean something. Tywin laughs in his grave. Or his privy, whichever.King's LandingI do not think I have mentioned how disappointed I was with Jaime. Last season's Dorne arc was pathetic, but his tender moment with Myrcella right before her death made me hope for a better arc this time. I thought that the Riverlands arc would be better set up, with Jaime going there via Dorne. Taking names and kicking ass, before being set for his quest for redemption. Here he is with Cersei, still not ready to dump her ass. Cersei is vain vengeance personified as before. Everyone has acknowledged Frankengregor already. Good.\u00a0 Tommen is trying to be strong. Doesn't look like he'll be succeeding anytime soon.The best part was when the Small Council walked out on Jaime and Cersei. Kevan is so going to die!BraavosArya is clearly not a Warg. But her skills are coming along in unexpected ways.WinterfellYes, everyone was right, and I was hoping there weren't. Umber presents Rickon to the Butcher of the Dreadfort. And Osha too. Why is she so special, I wonder? But what annoys me is that the Umbers were supposed to be with the anti Bolton camp. Or at least, reluctant Boltons. If the Karstarks and Umbers side with Ramsay, his prediction of the Manderlies doing so as well is probably spot on too. So much for the entertaining Lord Manderly's wedding feast.This season will start picking up next episode, I think. Or the Fifth episode, where each character ought to be set on their path for this season.", "Clearly the title Oath Breaker is a big give away to lot of story lines. First things first.Jon Snow is back after being dead, so he is no longer the Lord Commander and is free from NW duties. Probably few people like Alliser and Olly are going to die.By the preview video, Rickon Stark is going to be the gift for Ramsay Snow. Now oathbreaker would go to two story lines, maybe we get to see the scene where Jaime Lannistern kills the Mad King. Second is the scene at Tower of Joy. Ned is the oathbreaker because he raises a Targaryen kid whereas he has already knelt down to Robert baratheon.\u00a0 Deanerys can also be the oathbreaker as she should have been at Vaes Dothrak.In any case,let's see. 6 hours to go! :D", "It was an episode with a scene, which I believe, everyone was looking forward to - The Tower of Joy.There were other scenes as well which were quite entertaining like The Beautiful Death of the False Brothers of the Night's Watch and Arya finally turning into no one.And yet, Tower of Joy was the one that stole the show.Finally, the readers and the viewers got to witness the face off between Ser Arthur Dayne - The Sword of the Morning and Eddard Stark. The scene was beautifully shot and action was mind-blowing! However, they did not introduce Dawn - the Valyrian steel sword of Arthur Dayne, which was a bummer.", "Oh come on people the show is great! I think people hating it are biased book readers. You all had an image in your head while reading the books and now want the show to be exactly like you've imagined. For people who hadn't read the books or all the spoilers and analysis all over the internet, this is the best show ever.

South.  What are you gonna do?  Get warm.  I was with you at Hardhome.  We saw what's out there.  We know it's coming here.  How can you leave us now?  I did everything I could. You know that.  You swore a vow.  Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.  - I gave my life. - For all nights to come.  They killed me, Edd! My own brothers.  You want me to stay here after that?  - ( horn blowing ) - Man: Riders approaching!  Man #2: Open the gate!  ( people murmuring )  This is good soup.  Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?  - With the peas and onions? - Mmm.  We never should have left Winterfell.  Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left?  I want to scream at myself, \"Don't go, you idiot.\"  How could we know?  I spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass I was to you.  I wish I could change everything.  We were children.  I was awful, just admit it.  ( chuckles )  You were occasionally awful.  I'm sure I can't have been great fun.  Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.  - Can you forgive me? - There's nothing to forgive.  - Forgive me. - All right.  All right, I forgive you.  ( laughs )  - ( coughing ) - ( laughs )  You'd think after thousands of years,  the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.  Where will you go?  Where will we go?  If I don't watch over you,  Father's ghost will come back and murder me.  Where will we go?  I can't stay here, not after what happened.  There's only one place we can go.  Home.  Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?  We'll take it back from them.  I don't have an army.  How many wildlings did you save?  They didn't come here to serve me.  They owe you their lives.  You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?  - Sansa. - Winterfell is our home.  It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's.  Wherever they are, it belongs to our family.  We have to fight for it.  I'm tired of fighting.  It's all I've done since I left home.  I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch.  I've killed wildlings. I've killed men that I admire.  I hanged a boy younger than Bran.  I fought and I lost.  If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe.  I want you to help me.  But I'll do it myself if I have to.  My lady.  Ser Davos.  Will you stay here at Castle Black?  I will do as Jon Snow commands.  You serve Jon Snow now?  He's the prince that was promised.  Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.  What happened down there?  There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.  And Shireen?  What happened to the princess?  I saw what happened.  I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field.  My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.  We've met before.  I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.  Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.  That's in the past now.  Yes, it's in the past.  It doesn't mean I forget.  Or forgive.  He admitted it, you know.  Who did?  Stannis.  Just before I executed him.  ( sighs )  ( horses approaching )  ( horse whinnies )  The Defender of the Vale!  Uncle Petyr!  My lord.  Come and see.  I missed your name day. Go on.  - ( screeches ) - ( gasps ) A falcon!  A gyrfalcon.  The greatest and rarest of birds.  Last time I saw you, Baelish,  you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.  Indeed I was.  And yet not long ago, we received reports  that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.  On our way to the Fingers,  we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men.  Seemed to know exactly when  we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.  Do you take me for a fool?  Tell me, Lord Royce,  how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?  I shared my intentions with you  and no one else.  Slander a man in his own home,  you might find yourself crossing swords with him.  Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us.  And only his judgment concerns me.  Robin: Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?  My lord.  My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn.  To your father, to your mother, and now to you.  Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?  ( screeches )  Lord Royce has served the Vale well.  He's enjoyed a distinguished military career.  If we could trust his absolute loyalty,  he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.  You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.  I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?  Fine.  I bring good news.  My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.  I expect she's headed to Castle Black  where her brother serves as Lord Commander.  But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.  ( sighs )  She's my cousin.  We should help her.  That was my instinct as well.  Our lord has spoken.  Gather the Knights of the Vale.  The time has come to join the fray.  ( birds screeching )  Grey Worm: You invite the enemy into our city?  I did.  As a clever man once told me,  \"We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.\"  Grey Worm: I don't make peace with the queen's enemies.  I kill the queen's enemies.  Yes, that's the military approach.  And how has that worked here in Meereen?  I represent the diplomatic approach.  Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters  and they tried to murder her.  We enter these negotiations with open eyes.  Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery  has taught me the horrors of that institution.  How many days were you a slave?  ( stammers ) Long enough to know.  Not long enough to understand.  I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor.  And somehow you've risen  to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.  It's most impressive.  And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.  Here's to reversals of fortune.  We came here to meet the queen  and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.  Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.  We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.  Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.  Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever.  Her path takes her westward.  When we last met, I offered her ships  so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.  She refused them because hundreds of thousands  of men, women, and children still lived in chains.  As they have since the dawn of time.  - Not anymore. - You think you're a free man now?  You still follow orders.  Just because your master has silver hair and tits  doesn't mean she's not a master.  Friends, friends, friends, please.  There have always been  those with wealth and power and those with nothing.  That is the way of the world.  I'm not here to change the way of the world.  Slavery is the way of our world.  You don't need slaves to make money.  There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years  and I grew up richer than any of you.  But our queen recognizes that she erred  by abolishing slavery  without providing a new system to replace it.  So here is the queen's proposal.  Slavery will never return to Meereen,  but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay  time to adjust to the new order.  What does that mean?  Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,  we will give you seven years to end the practice.  Slaveholders will be compensated  for their losses, of course, at fair prices.  In exchange, you will cut off  your support for the Sons of the Harpy.  We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.  Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.  I do hope you accept, my friends.  You will not receive a better offer.  ( rings bell )  Let us sail on the tide of freedom  instead of being drowned by it.  And as a parting gift to our honored guests  Give freedom a chance.  See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before.  ( whispering in Valyrian )  ( Tyrion speaking Valyrian )  Perhaps I should translate for you.  Man: We speak the Common Tongue.  - Excellent. - You met with the slavers today.  Tyrion: I did.  Our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum.  Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.  I imagine this room was built  so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.  But I am not your ruler.  I'm not the Breaker of Chains.  I'm not the Unburnt.  And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.  You are a stranger here.  So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?  Because our queen chose me as her advisor.  Until she returns from her travels--  When does she return?  Soon. You have my word.  We don't know you. We don't trust you. We know Torgo Nudho.  We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.  And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.  As commander of the Unsullied, he knows how to defeat the slavers  and he knows when it is time to make peace.  You have made peace with the slavers?  Tyrion: We offered terms.  ( speaking Valyrian )  - Do not use me for your lies. - Those men respect you.  They respect me because they know who I am.  - They know I am loyal. - As do I.  I am loyal to my queen, not you.  If you betray her work, you are my enemy.  I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.  You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.  For a short time.  Seven years is not a short time for a slave.  You're right.  Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once.  War is a horror that should be ended at once.  I can't do both today.  You are wrong to trust these men.  I don't trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest.  They're trustworthy if they're convinced  that working with me is in their self-interest.  You don't know them. You don't understand them.  We are not human in their eyes.  They look at me and see a weapon.  They look at her and see a whore.  They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast.  Their contempt is their weakness.  They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.  You will not use them.  They will use you. That is what they do.  ( bird screeching )  ( breathing heavily )  You all right?  Why don't you sit and catch your breath?  - I'm fine. - ( chuckles )  I don't think you could ride the dragon.  20 years ago, maybe.  - What? - Our queen.  She's wild, you know. Don't let her size fool you.  It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man.  You, I don't think your heart could take it.  Must make you angry that our queen chose me.  Makes me sad. You'll disappoint her before long.  - She'll move on. - We'll all disappoint her before long.  We need each other right now. After we're done needing each other--  Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal.  What do I have to gain?  If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man.  If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man.  You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?  None.  The road running through the Horse Gate,  they call that the godsway.  Eastern Market, Western Market.  When Khal Drogo died,  she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,  the widows of the dead khals.  That's where they would have taken her,  the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.  What are you doing?  It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.  Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?  If they spot us and we're unarmed,  we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market.  But if they see weapons  You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.  There's 100,000 of them down there.  We can't fight our way out.  We wait till dark, and then we'll find her.  Uh  I'm very attached to this knife.  Don't worry. It didn't touch you.  You know what happens?  I know what happens.  I'll do it myself.  - ( drum music playing ) - ( chatter )  ( moaning )  I should have been born a Dothraki.  ( men speaking Dothraki )  - Come on. - ( continues in Dothraki )  ( speaking Dothraki )  ( grunting )  ( shouts )  ( shouting in Dothraki )  ( bone cracks )  ( choking )  ( squelches )  ( gasping )  Told you, I'm very attached to this knife.  You all right?  If they find a body with a stab wound,  the whole city will be looking for us.  ( grunting )  ( thuds )  Huh.  ( women speaking Dothraki )  Mm-hmm.  - No, don't hurt her. - She'll give us away.  We have to go now.  ( whimpering )  We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.  All we can do is try.  No.  We can do more than that.  And you're going to help me.  ( speaking Dothraki )  If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go?  - ( door closes ) - What would you seek out?  I'd go to my brother,  my husband, my family.  Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money,  finery, power.  Seeking out your family means seeking out sin.  I'm not maligning you.  I sought those things out, too.  To the exclusion of all else.  My father was a cobbler.  He died when I was young and I took over his shop.  He was a simple man and he made simple shoes.  But I found that the more work I put into my shoes,  the more people wanted them.  Fine leather, ornamentation,  detailing, and time.  Time most of all.  Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.  Quality takes time.  ( chuckles ) Yes.  I imagine you've worn a year  of someone's life on your back.  The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time  and they paid well for the privilege.  I used their money  to buy a taste of their lives for myself.  Each time I indulged,  I felt myself ascending to something better.  And one day you walked through a graveyard  and realized it was all for nothing  and set out on the path to righteousness.  Book of the Stranger, verse 25.  You know \"The Seven-Pointed Star.\"  Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.  Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people.  You're close.  But it wasn't a graveyard.  It was a feast.  I bought old fine wine  and young pretty girls  and invited my friends to come and share it all.  We passed around the wine, passed around the women,  and soon we fell into a stupor.  I woke before dawn.  I could barely stand.  Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor,  lying in heaps next to their fine clothes.  The truth of their bodies laid bare.  I could smell them  beneath the incense and the perfume  and the fine food that had already started to turn.  And I saw it with perfect clarity.  I saw what my sins were.  The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used,  my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position.  It was all part of a story.  A story I was telling myself about who I was.  A collection of lies  that would disappear in the light.  The people I was trying to climb away from,  the beggars in the street,  the poor,  they were closer to the truth than I ever was.  So what did you do?  I left to go and find them.  I didn't even put on my shoes.  I walked out the door and never went back.  Come, let's go and see him.  - Who? - Your brother.  ( door locks )  Loras.  Loras.  ( sobbing )  Listen to me.  You need to stay strong.  I can't stay strong.  I never was strong.  You are strong.  You are the future of our house,  the future of our family.  - I don't care about that. - Shh!  Shh.  Have you-- have you told them that?  That you don't care?  I just want it to stop.  Help me.  ( sobbing )  They want me to help you.  They want me to help tear you down.  They want me to help tear you down.  That's why he's letting me see you. I know it is.  And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.  Let them win.  Just make it stop.  Please.  - ( sobbing ) - All right.  Pycelle: And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament.  This High Sparrow.  I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace.  Not setting them off, that's the most important thing.  You are beset with enemies both within and without.  What are you doing here?  I am advising the king on our current predicament.  Leave.  I am a member of the small council.  The king--  Is this a small council meeting?  Obviously not.  I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.  Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester.  That will be all for now.  Your Grace.  Since I've missed the past several small council meetings,  I wanted to speak to you about a few things.  I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.  As have we all, unfortunately.  We need to be careful in dealing with such a man.  To prevent things from escalating any further.  We have to be careful not to antagonize him.  He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk.  - He's dangerous. - Look at me.  What did they do to me?  To the king's own mother?  It's all right.  It's done. It's in the past.  And of course  Margaery's safety is paramount.  You don't like Margaery, do you?  Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant.  Margaery is the queen.  Queens must command respect. Kings even more so.  Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's.  The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens.  No respect for anything in this world.  He has no use for the things of this world.  He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?  With fantasies.  With beggars in the street.  With nothing.  Mother  there's something I want to tell you.  Something the High Sparrow told me.  You've spoken with him?  I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told--  It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly  given his constant prattling about the truth.  I am your mother.  You can always trust me.  ( door opens )  The small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.  I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time.  You're not welcome.  You once spoke of your respect for our father  because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.  My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority,  publically shamed, and confined to the Red Keep.  ( chuckles ) What's left to work with?  Jaime: Cersei is the mother of the king.  She has the king's ear and his trust.  And the king has been speaking regularly  with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.  The High Sparrow seized power  knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves  instead of seizing it back.  Here we are. Well done to us.  Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms  rests in his dirty peasant hands.  In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.  But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement.  Yes, Margaery will repent her sins  before the good people of the city.  Oh, no.  That cannot happen.  That will not happen.  I agree.  You've got the second largest army in Westeros.  You'll bring them into the city,  stop Queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts,  and take her back into Crown custody.  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow  or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.  You will take no action at all.  When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down.  Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?  No, but if the king should call--  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything.  When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably,  and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,  do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?  You hate these fanatics as much as we do.  You hate what they've done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back?  Or have you given him up for good?  Of course I want him back.  Then stand aside  and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.  If it doesn't go as planned,  the sparrows have many friends in this city.  We'll have civil war. Many will die.  Many will die no matter what we do.  Better them than us.  ( chatter )  ( fire crackling )  They told me you were home and I didn't believe it.  \"Theon Greyjoy?\" I said.  \"He's dead.  He's been dead a long time.\"  He let you go?  I escaped.  I can't hear you.  I escaped.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Men died trying to rescue you.  Good men.  My men.  I'm sorry.  You were my brother.  You were a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother  and I risked everything for you  and you betrayed me.  I know. I know and I'm sorry.  Stop saying that.  He broke me.  He broke me into 1,000 pieces.  - I know. - You don't know.  He sent us one of those pieces.  That's why I came for you.  ( sobbing )  Why did you come here?  Where else could I go?  You heard Father was dead and you thought you'd claim the crown?  No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.  You happen to show up on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?  I didn't know.  You think any ironborn wants you to be king  after what you've done?  I don't want to be king.  What do you want?  I should have listened to you. You're the only one--  That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me.  Tell me what you want.  You should rule the Iron Islands.  Let me help you.  They've cleaned you up nicely.  You know who I am?  A lord.  Yes.  A lord.  You've seen my banners?  The flayed man.  Does that worry you at all?  You eat them after?  ( chuckles )  No.  ( scoffs ) Then I've seen worse.  You served the Starks?  Aye. They put me in chains  and put a sword at my throat,  so I served them.  The Starks have been gone for a long time,  but you kept protecting Rickon.  He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer.  I served his family a long time.  Didn't get no wages.  Way I see it, I'm owed.  Be that as it may,  Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.  He's mine.  So what use could I possibly have for you?  ( scoffs )  I can give you what you want.  And you're sure you know what that is?  Same thing men always want.  And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.  ( moans )  You're a good talker.  I like that.  You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.  That so?  I had to work hard to get him talking.  But he talked.  They all do.  He told me everything.  All about the Stark boys,  who helped them escape,  and how she did it.  ( sighs )  Man: Open the gate!  Sorry about the food.  It's not what we're known for.  That's all right. There are more important things.  ( door opens )  A letter for you, Lord Commander.  I'm not Lord Commander anymore.  \"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow.  You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall.  You have betrayed your own kind.  You have betrayed the North.  Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see.  Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.  His direwolf's skin is on my floor.  Come and see. I want my bride back.  Send her to me, bastard,  and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers.  Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter  every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection.  You will watch as I skin them living.  You--\"  Go on.  It's just more of the same.  \"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister.  You will watch as my dogs  devour your wild little brother.  Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.  Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell  and Warden of the North.\"  Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.  His father's dead.  Ramsay killed him.  - And now he has Rickon. - We don't know that.  Yes, we do.  How many men does he have in his army?  I heard him say 5,000  once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.  How many do you have?  That can march and fight?  2,000.  The rest are children and old people.  You're the son of the last true Warden of the North.  Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.  A monster has taken our home and our brother.  We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.

Jorah and Daario undertake a difficult task. Jaime and Cersei try to improve their situation.  Summary In King's Landing Underneath the Great Sept of Baelor, Septa Unella enters Queen Margaery Tyrell's cell and leads her to a private meeting with the High Sparrow. The High Sparrow asks Margaery what she would do if he allowed her to leave that day. Margaery replies that she wants to return to her family and her husband Tommen Baratheon. The High Sparrow respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin, citing his experience as a cobbler. Margaery manages to impress the Sparrow with her knowledge of The Book of the Stranger, which she admits Septa Unella had read at her. The High Sparrow chuckles and agrees that Unella has a habit of reading at people instead of to them.  The High Sparrow recounts how in his youth, he was a womanizer and drunkard. He underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy, as his drunken guests lay naked all around his house. Tired of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence, the High Sparrow turned his life around and became a devoted member of the Faith of the Seven. He then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute. Believing he has found a way to reach Margaery, the Sparrow allows her to visit her brother Loras Tyrell.  Book of the Stranger 11 Margaery remains in her cell.  She finds a dejected Loras lying on the floor of his cell. Loras has lost the will to continue resisting but Margaery tells him to stay strong because he is the future of House Tyrell. Loras tells them that he only wants his imprisonment to end and pleads with her to help him. Margaery tells Loras that the Sparrow is trying to use them to break each other and again tells him to stay strong.  At the Red Keep, Cersei Lannister walks in on Grand Maester Pycelle advising King Tommen to accommodate the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant. Cersei requests that Pycelle leave the room while she talks to her son alone under the pretext of meeting him for updates about the previous Small Council meetings. During their conversation, Tommen proposes that the Iron Throne not antagonize the Sparrows further in an effort to avoid endangering Margaery's life. Cersei reminds her son about the humiliation she endured at the Sparrows' hands and exploits Tommen's love for Margaery. She convinces her son that the High Sparrow has no respect for kings, queens, and society. Tommen then reveals a secret that the High Sparrow shared with him.  Armed with this new information, Cersei barges into a Small Council meeting between Kevan Lannister, Olenna Tyrell, and Jaime Lannister. While Kevan and Olenna are initially hostile, Cersei convinces them to listen to her. She then informs the Council that the High Sparrow has planned to make Margaery do the walk of atonement. Olenna is horrified that the Sparrows plan to debase her granddaughter. Jaime then urges the Council to allow the Tyrells to march their army into King's Landing, crush the Faith Militant, and bring Margaery and Loras back to the Red Keep into Crown custody. Kevan says that Tommen expressly forbid him to use the Lannister army he commands at the city to make a move against the Great Sept, for fear that the Faith Militant will harm Margaery in retaliation. Jaime suggests that Olenna send House Tyrell's army to the city instead, and points out to his uncle that Tommen only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying, so Kevan wouldn't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the Tyrell army arrives. The Tyrell army will surround the Great Sept, intimidating the Sparrows into releasing Margaery and Loras, without any blood actually being shed - and by the time Tommen finds out what they've done he will already be happy with the outcome. Kevan's interest is now turned, but he still expresses reluctance should they fail. Cersei is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the Sparrows for taking his last remaining son and heir Lancel Lannister. Olenna agrees that blood will be shed no matter what they do at this point, so it's better if it's the Sparrows' blood and not theirs.  At the Wall At Castle Black, Eddison Tollett watches Jon Snow pack up his things. Edd scolds Jon for leaving the Night's Watch after taking an oath, to which Jon replies that he gave his life for the Night's Watch and can't trust his Watch brothers after what happened. Edd reminds him they both saw what happened at Hardhome and that enemy is still coming for them. At that moment, the horns sound for the arrival of travellers. Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne ride through the gates and dismount in the courtyard. Jon rushes out to see his half-sister Sansa for the first time since their family left Winterfell and they embrace. Later that night, they converse and reminisce on their childhood. Sansa proposes they take Winterfell back from the Boltons but Jon says he's done fighting, especially after hanging Olly.  Book of the Stranger 25 Jon and Sansa are reunited at the Wall.  Davos Seaworth asks whether Melisandre will stay at Castle Black and she replies she will do as Jon Snow, The Prince That Was Promised, commands. Davos asks what happened to Stannis and she replies he was defeated in battle. When he asks about Shireen, Melisandre is reluctant to speak. Their conversation is interrupted by Brienne, who recognizes Davos and Melisandre as Stannis' former entourage. Still bitter over the death of King Renly Baratheon, Brienne warns Melisandre that she does not forget or forgive. She also tells them that she executed Stannis after he admitted using blood magic to assassinate Renly.  Some time later, Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton stating that he has Rickon Stark at Winterfell and if Sansa is not returned, he will slaughter every Wildling at Castle Black, let his men rape Sansa, and feed Jon and Rickon to his dogs. Jon asks Tormund how many men he has available to fight and Tormund replies he has 2,000 able fighters, far less than the estimated 5,000 Ramsay has. Sansa says that they have to try to retake their home and rescue their brother and that the houses of the North will unite behind Jon as the son of the true Warden of the North. Jon agrees to take Ramsay down.  At Runestone Book of the Stranger 08 Robin practices his archery.  At Runestone, Robin Arryn trains at his archery with Lord Yohn Royce. However, Robin is just as pitiful at archery as he is at swordsmanship. Petyr Baelish arrives with a retinue of Arryn guards and a pet falcon as a belated name-day gift for Robin, much to his delight. Royce reminds Baelish that Baelish told him that he was taking Robin's cousin Sansa with him to The Fingers, but Royce received word that she had been married to Ramsay Bolton. Baelish tells him that on the way to The Fingers, he and Sansa were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. A confrontation between Petyr and Royce ensues, in which Petyr accuses Royce of giving away the information regarding the location of Sansa Stark to House Bolton. When Royce accuses Baelish of slander, Petyr reminds him that Robin is the Lord of the Vale, and asks for his judgment. Robin then asks Baelish if they should throw Lord Royce from the Moon Door, which prompts the surrounding knights, including those loyal to Royce, to muster themselves. Royce swears his loyalty to Robin, and he is let off without punishment on Baelish's recommendation. Royce comes to the dark realization that Littlefinger has control over Robin. Petyr and Robin decide they have to muster the Vale knights to march North and aid Sansa.  In Winterfell At Winterfell, Osha is brought before Ramsay Bolton, who says that while her fellow captive Rickon Stark has value to Ramsay, he is unsure of her worth. Osha denounces the Starks, saying that her servitude and loyalty to them were forced. She also attempts to seduce Ramsay, climbing onto his lap and kissing him, all the while trying to get the knife he had been using to peel apples. Ramsay seemingly falls for it, saying that it took much longer for him to get Theon Greyjoy over to his side but that Theon told him everything, including how Osha had seduced Theon in order to help Rickon and Bran Stark escape Winterfell. Osha realizes that she has been lured into a trap, and tries to stab Ramsay, only for him to slash her throat first. He resumes peeling his apple complacently as she dies on the floor.  At Pyke Book of the Stranger 09 Theon returns home.  Theon Greyjoy returns home to Pyke, where he learns of the death of his father, Balon Greyjoy. His sister, Yara, is unhappy about his return and his earlier refusal to leave the Dreadfort when she made an attempt to rescue him from Ramsay Bolton. Theon explains that Ramsay \"broke him into a thousand pieces,\" which Yara affirms, \"Yes, he sent us one of those pieces,\" referring to the box containing Theon's penis that she and Balon Greyjoy received. Yara suspects that Theon has come back to declare himself King of the Iron Islands, but he insists that he does not want the crown. Instead, he wants for Yara to rule, and offers to help her in any way that he can.  In Meereen Tyrion Lannister along with Grey Worm, Missandei, and Varys meet with representatives of the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and the slave-trading city of Volantis; who have arrived by sea. As the diplomatic mission enters the harbor, Grey Worm advocates using military force. When Tyrion explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave, Missandei counters that he has not truly experienced slavery. The emissaries are Tyrion's former slave master Yezzan zo Qaggaz, the Yunkai'i Wise Master Razdal mo Eraz and the Volantene triarch Belicho Paenymion.  Book of the Stranger 12 Varys, Tyrion and Missandei converge to prepare for their meeting.  In their meeting chambers, Yezzan marvels that Tyrion has gone from being a nearly-worthless slave to the de facto ruler of Meereen. The slave-trading cities offer to give Daenerys Targaryen and her mercenaries a large pot of money if they sail away from Slaver's Bay. When Missandei defends Daenerys's actions in liberating slaves, Razdal contends that slavery has existed for centuries. After hearing their offer, Tyrion proposes a counter-offer. He offers to give them a seven-year grace period to phase out slavery and to compensate slave owners, however they must end all backing for the Sons of the Harpy (regardless of whether they admit this backing or not).  He then cautions them that they will not get a better offer. Tyrion then gives them time to consider his offer, though Grey Worm and Missandei insist on abolishing slavery.  Tyrion and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the Meereen throne room. A freedman demands to know when Daenerys will return while another is appalled at the idea of Tyrion negotiating with slave traders. Tyrion insists he is doing his best to rule the city in Daenerys's absence. The freedmen do not trust Tyrion, a foreigner and a newcomer, and look to Grey Worm and Missandei for reassurance. Despite their misgivings, they both publicly back Tyrion's diplomacy in front of the freedmen. In private, Grey Worm and Missandei warn Tyrion that the masters will outmaneuver him, despite his best efforts to do the same to them.  In Vaes Dothrak Ser Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis approach the outskirts of Vaes Dothrak and discard their weapons, as drawing a blade in the city is considered sacrilege. Within the city itself, Jorah and Daario run afoul of Akho and Iggo who see through Jorah's claims to be a wine merchant. Daario takes care of Iggo while Akho tackles Jorah. The knight is nearly undone, but Daario saves him at the last minute with the stiletto he smuggled in. As a precaution Daario smashes Aggo's skull with a rock to disguise his use of a bladed weapon.  Meanwhile, the High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen gives Daenerys a commentary on the other crones. Some of them hate Daenerys, thinking the Dothraki should not interbreed with other races, but the high priestess dismisses them, saying that the Dothraki have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity. To illustrate her point, the high priestess indicates another of the khaleen, a Lhazareen girl (Ornela) taken from her village at the age of twelve. Daenerys asks to relieve herself, and the high priestess sends Ornela with her. As they walk, Daenerys learns that Ornela's khal died when she was only sixteen. The pair are interrupted by Jorah and Daario, who take the Lhazareen hostage. Daenerys, unsurprised to see them, cancels their plans for escape \u2013 they have a slim chance of leaving Vaes Dothrak, let alone getting back to Meereen \u2013 and tells them that she has a plan of her own. She asks Ornela if she is willing to help them, calling her Khaleesi (queen) instead of a khaleen (crone). The girl reluctantly agrees.  During the Khalar vezhven, the khals argue about how to deal with Iggo and Akho's deaths; Khal Moro defuses the situation by reminding them that Ahko was a member of his khalasar, and he does not care about finding the killer if he was stupid enough to get himself killed. Daenerys is then brought in by the two priestesses she befriended before. Moro feels she should join the dosh khaleen, but another khal expresses interest in making her his khaleesi, while another suggests giving her to the Wise Masters in exchange for ten thousand horses.  Daenerys dismisses all of them. She reminds them that her husband, in the same temple in which they all now sit, declared that he would lead a Dothraki army across the Narrow Sea to retake the Iron Throne for his khaleesi, while all they have done since is raid and plunder nearby villages. She declares they are all petty and weak, and none of them are fit to lead the Dothraki - so she will lead them herself.  After a pause, Moro and the khals burst into laughter. Disgusted with her insolence, Moro decrees that instead of joining the dosh khaleen, she will be raped by each of the khals, then by all of their bloodriders, and then, if she is still alive, by their horses. He mocks the notion that they would ever think of serving her. Throughout their scorn, Daenerys's smile has not faltered at all; in fact, she seems to relish the thought. She calmly reaches over and clamps her hand on the basket of a burning brazier; yet she doesn't flinch. The khals expressions turn to amazement and fear as they realise too late just whom they are dealing with. In a flat tone, Daenerys informs them they aren't going to serve; they're going to die. With these words she topples the brazier, setting the floor of the hut alight in seconds. The khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly spreading fire, only to find the temple's single door barred, the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead outside. Khal Moro is the only one left as he turns to face Daenerys, who pushes the last brazier over in his direction. Khal Moro is engulfed by flames and his screams don't last long.    Daeneryskhalasargaze Dany proves to the Dothraki who their true Khaleesi is.  As the flames climb higher, the dosh khaleen and khalasars gather outside in confusion, watching their temple burn. Eventually, the doors collapse and Daenerys emerges, her clothes burnt off her body but otherwise untouched by the flames. The entire leadership present at Vaes Dothrak is now incinerated. Awed, horrified and fearful in equal measure, the crowd of thousands bow to Daenerys almost immediately, with the high priestess and the rest of the dosh khaleen following after a moment. Jorah and Daario move to the front of the crowd and bow as well. While Jorah has seen this once before, the normally unflappable Daario is utterly awestruck. "], "review": ["Going down off the top of my head:Thank God they actually reunited Jon and Sansa and didn\u2019t pull the \u201coh you just missed him\u201d shit I thought they might. Why they had Jon march toward the northern side of the Wall only to \u2026 stay where he was \u2026 I don\u2019t know. But the Jon/Sansa reunion was great and I\u2019m glad Sansa is having him get his ass in the game. The major plot I actually cared about \u2014 Jon, Sansa and getting the North back \u2014 is finally primed. And so many great characters are intersecting here, it\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m guessing Brienne and Podrick head to the Riverlands to try to get the Tullys on board (or at least, see what\u2019s happening), while Davos and Sansa and Co. go on their big PR tour. I\u2019d like to see Jon get more gung ho (see his reaction to the Pink Letter in the book), but baby steps. It also makes me wonder if this will also be the core group that eventually \u201cfights the good fight\u201d against not only Ramsay but also the Others and *gulp* maybe Dany. Jon, Davos, Brienne, Tormund, Sansa and even Melisandre on the same side looks a LOT like, \u201cHere is your final pack of protagonists.\u201d Is it any coincidence that all of these characters are suddenly now converged (and have converging goals even if, say, Brienne and Pod go to the Riverlands) as the show enters its endgame? I don\u2019t think so.The Faith stuff is officially a slog. We get it, Cersei is pissed, Tommen is dickless, Loras and Margaery are trapped and the Sparrow is nuts. Get on with it.Not a fan of the Iron Islands in the book, even though I like Asha (Yara). Interesting to throw Theon into the Kingsmoot, though.I still do not give a shit about Meereen but it was interesting to see Tyrion make what looked like progress where Dany couldn\u2019t make any. I think we\u2019re meant to wonder if Tyrion is right and compromise was necessary, or Missandei and Grey Worm are right and Tyrion\u2019s being naive. Could be either one. But I don\u2019t care which. :-(You knew Osha wasn\u2019t long for the world but I\u2019d have liked to see her go out better than that. I guess we should be thankful it wasn\u2019t another hounds-devour-woman scene or a rape scene or anything too horrific. Stabbed in the throat is probably the best way she could have gone out. It also drove the point home that Ramsay is not Theon and can\u2019t be flattered or persuaded.I have finally found my zen with the Dany-is-fireproof bullshit. I can\u2019t tell if I wasn\u2019t giving them enough credit before or am giving them too much credit now, but here you go: Kelsey L. Hayes's answer to Why is Daenerys Targaryen apparently immune to fire in the show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d? And thinking about it more, the red priests might enter the picture as a direct result of hearing about her newest stunt. Which would actually just further drive home my point.I actually found the Dothraki set-up itself much more annoying than Dany being fireproof, something the show had already sort of established. These other women just need a Girl Talk, doncha know, to get out of their rut. And the Dothraki are sexist rapist assholes who underestimate the girl, like any foe Dany seems to face, really, so it\u2019s cool if they just sit there and do absolutely nothing while she knocks over some braziers. And of course all the cowed brown people immediately kneel the fuck down before the naked pasty girl coming out of the fire. I groaned; they didn\u2019t learn their lesson from the \u201cyay colonialism!\u201d shit that ended the third season. I mentioned this in another answer, but this, THIS, is your bright line between Jon and Dany: Jon experiences a touch of the magical and immediately says he isn\u2019t a god and is freaked by the whole thing and doesn\u2019t expect, demand or welcome adoration or worship from anyone. Whereas Dany looks on like, \u201cHell yeah, bow before me, serfs\u201d (note the use of Smug Smirkface, one of Dany\u2019s three trademark expressions, along with Vacant Mile-Long Stare and Crazyface). I know everyone is ~caught up in the moment~ but \u2026 something is not right here. And I think D&D may be telling us as much and it\u2019s getting lost in the \u201comg Dany is amazing!\u201d thing on the one hand from show-only viewers and \u201cWhat the hell are they doing?\u201d reaction from the book-readers. Both sides see Dany as this special heroic snowflake (either because they actually think she is or because they\u2019re annoyed D&D are painting her as such) but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what\u2019s being conveyed.The good news is that the quota\u2019d Dany power moment for the season is done with. Let\u2019s move on.", "It was pretty bad. While it isn\u2019t as bad as some of the top stinkers (S5E10, S6E1), there was too much that\u2019s disappointing at best or just plain stupid at worst.Let\u2019s start with what\u2019s plain stupid.-The ending scene with Daenerys, the darling D&D are trying too hard to make us love. Why did the Khals do nothing but stand around scared when she spills over the brazier? I thought these men built their lives around being able to react to intense situations. Also, as many lore buffs on Quora emphasize, Dany isn\u2019t supposed to be immune to fire. That\u2019s a fact that GRRM himself confirmed. Of course, at this point, it\u2019s clear that the minds behind the show don\u2019t give a damn about the source material. Even worse, they care more about presenting this dumbed down, generic good vs. evil story for the masses, which just isn\u2019t what ASOIAF is about.Now let\u2019s move on to what\u2019s disappointing.I was expecting Euron to appear again this episode, the Kingsmoot to happen, and for another good taste of his seductive eccentric insanity but all we got was this scene that consisted of Yar(Asha) being mad with Theon about the events of her failed rescue back in Season 4.The failed rescue that to this day, is close to being one of the worst scenes to come out of Game of Thrones, featuring shirtless Ramsay and vengeful Ironborn who don\u2019t even try to hit him. Seriously, there was this great opening for Yara to throw an axe at him while he was busy opening the dog cages, but they needed Ramsay to survive for at least two more seasons (so he could rape Sansa, display ungodly military prowess against Stannis, kill his father without any real consequences, feed Walda and his little brother without any real consequences and get rewarded by a free young Stark boy immediately after, thwart an assassination attempt and knife Tonks in the neck, etc.). It\u2019s clear they want him to be the Big Bad against Sansa and Jon, at the \u201cbig\u201d (~5000 Boltons, less wildlings, ??Vale Army) that\u2019ll last all of S6E9.(As far as that battle goes\u2026it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t sound very exciting. In terms of scale, it\u2019s just a battle between leftovers from the War of the Five Kings. It should have happened last season. The Battle of the Blackwater was ten times more massive, and the events at Hardhome was ten times more significant as far as plot goes. Instead, they have Brienne execute Stannis to give a battle that should have been his victory to Jon, and have it fill up an entire episode at the end of the subsequent season. I thought we\u2019d be having the Others break down the wall by this point, but it looks like they\u2019re competing with Daenerys in some procrastinate-on-getting-to-the-seven-kingdoms-competition.)At the wall, Brienne reveals to Davos that she executed Stannis. He should have put a knife through her eyes right there for that, but sadly, he didn\u2019t. Hopefully Brienne becomes fuel for another Melisandre sacrifice, or gets the Reek treatment from Ramsay. But this isn\u2019t a just world, and that\u2019s not going to happen, because she\u2019s apparently going to be in Riverrun later this season. Why would she? To get assistance from the Tullys? Edmure is a prisoner, and the Blackfish is under siege by Lannisters (who she\u2019s worked with) at Riverrun. How can they help? One thing is clear, she\u2019ll be back to filling her role as the most useless character on the screen.(Note: My dislike of Brienne isn\u2019t because of her character traits, but because she\u2019s another Olly, and to some extent, another Ramsay. She performs feats the writers need to be performed to advance the plot. Olly was shoehorned into shanking Jon. Ramsay was shoehorned into being invincible so that he can torture and rape to his hearts delight (so that we can hate him and cheer for Jon/Sansa to bring about his downfall\u2026which will probably be done by Littlefinger instead - HA!! ha\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026ohgod)The character that everyone was clamoring to resurrect, Jon Snow, isn\u2019t back with a vengeance. You would think that he would be jumping out of death itself to give the mutineers a taste of Longclaw, and display the kind of badass ruthlessness worthy of the Starks who held the North for millenia. He\u2019s supposed to be back to be the real Prince Who Was Promised. He is the real Warrior of Light (not that Stannis poser; who, by the way, had a much more compelling actor). The next target on his list should be the bastard who raped his half-sister repeatedly and holds a North that won\u2019t be united against the pending White Walker invasion.But\u2026he\u2019s back with this weird intent to just\u2026give up? What was he planning on doing before receiving the Pink Letter? Dress like Ned Stark and wait for Ramsay to come in and mistake him for a character played by Sean Bean? Pathetic.At this point, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he accidentally trips and falls on Ramsays sword with that stupid vacant expression Kit Harington loves to perpetually give. Sadly, the audience would still clamor for another resurrection.", "Prologue: I think a lot of the disappointment for book readers is that the show just has \u2018magic\u2019. \u2018Magic\u2019 is generic and just does stuff: Dragon hatching is magic, Melisandre is magic and does magic. Magic happens.To be honest, in my eyes, that\u2019s a good thing. If we saw the subtleties, the real \u2018cost\u2019 of the different types of magic in the books, it would be a massive spoiler. We\u2019d be able to extrapolate \u2018rules\u2019 and \u2018origins\u2019 and \u2018mechanisms\u2019 and it would ruin books 6 and 7. If this is the rationale, then colour me grateful: I appreciate the thought.Castle Black: Early adopters of Sansa the strong woman were absolutely right. She is fab. The best aspect of show Sansa is that she doesn\u2019t follow the Dany-Melisandre rule for reasoned debate\u2026\u2019when they doubt, let them out\u2019. Keeping her top on at all times, she is intelligent and fearless. Meanwhile Tormund is giving Brienne the full Joey Tribbiani - \u2018how you doing?\u2019The Vale: Like Rickon, Robert has grown up real fast: toddler to teen in 30 seconds. Littlefinger buys his \u2018yeah\u2026whatever\u2026.Moon Door\u2019 with a falcon. A Gyr-falcon. It absolutely beggars belief that the Lord of the fucking Vale, the spoilt little bastard with falcons on practically everything in his impregnable castle, which is called the fucking Eyrie, has never owned a falcon before. The Knights of the Vale must be supremely stupid never to have thought of buying him a falcon because, if I were prepared to do Lysa Arryn to gain power, I\u2019d have explored every single other option first. Seems obvious to me, but maybe I\u2019m an absolute genius like Littlefinger. Though not as creepy. Looking forward to seeing his head decorating a spike in Winterfell.King\u2019s Landing: the Lord Privy Toast-Rack Tommen is blithering. Boring.Meereen: If anyone needs to get their boobs out it\u2019s Tyrion because Grey Worm and Missendei are struggling to believe in the Audacity of Hope. Tyrion is still doing his House MD impression: should he be called on for an urgent diagnosis, it\u2019s either the AWOIAF equivalent of sarcoidosis, or the AWOIAF equivalent of Wegner\u2019s. It\u2019s always one or the other. Never lupus, though (thanks, Govind).Vaes Dothrak: The Dothraki are cargo-culted by the new House Targaryen words: \u2018Boobs and Fire.\u2019 Magic everywhere.There\u2019s a hell of a mess to clear up.If we\u2019re being picky, it does seem strange that the Dothraki are awed by the impressive Unburnt conclusion to Dany\u2019s Disco Inferno. They ride all over Essos, doing their pillaging and stuff, and that continent is chock full of weirdos. Blue lipped weirdos. Shadow-binding weirdos. Warlock weirdos. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t get out much. I very much suspect that they\u2019re following her for her boobs. Why not?EDIT: it\u2019s easy to be wise after the event, but Royce should have offered Robert TWO falcons, then two falcons and a SPARROWHAWK, then two falcons, a sparrowhawk and sixteen PARROTS\u2026keep raising Royce, at some point Littlefinger\u2019s going to run out of caged birds because his wheelhouse isn\u2019t so big. Then, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s the better man\u2026", "Despite the spectacle that that had been missing in the last three episodes, I was disappointed in this one. Probably my least favorite of the entire season.I think it\u2019s just all too predictable, which would be OK if I thought the dialogue and the acting was really blowing me away. The acting is adequate but the dialogue is just horrible. Again, the High Septon\u2019s monologue is just another example of how bad Benioff and Weiss\u2019 dialogue is to me. I can\u2019t put my finger on it: it\u2019s almost a good monologue but because it just misses being good by a hair\u2019s-breadth it comes off as predictable, dull, cliched and shallow to me. Like, they say: we need to fill time, let\u2019s make a two person dialogue scene; we\u2019ll give some backstory of the High Septon! And then they proceed to nail all their well-worn cliches into it. Just awful. I still feel like they stress their political agendas even when they try not to. It\u2019s annoying.Sort of like Jon Bonjovi\u2019s lyrics. That\u2019s the nearest analogy that I can make. Which is weird but there you go.The plot is moving forward on all fronts, but overall the episode disappointed me and didn\u2019t satisfy me. As always, I pin the blame on Weiss and Benioff\u2019s writing most of all.AS far as the last scene goes, I was thinking yesterday that Dany would pull her big move in this episode four, after the last three episodes that were without huge spectacle.. However, I thought that Drogon would rescue her.I think it is a better choice that Dany does it herself. So Dany herself, it seems, is the Stallion Who Mounts the World, at least in the show. That\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019m still not sold that it\u2019s her and not Drogon in the books.I had a bit of a problme with the execution of the scene. Something about the music and Emilia Clarke\u2019s glassy gaze made me literally laugh out loud. It just felt off, the camera angles were funny and cliched. I did get a sense that it was going for a bit of a horror film feel, oddly, which makes me think that they are setting up Dany to commit atrocities.But broadly it was all very predictable.I was glad to see that Jon, realizing that his winter apparel was not going to cut it, came back to do some last minute packing.The reunion scene between Sansa and Jon was really well done and it brought tears to my eyes: I had\u2019dt realized how much I wanted Starks together.Exactly as I predicted, Jon said no, Sansa said yes, news of Rickon came and Jon said yes. the D\u2019s are not as clever as GRRM. The show is much more predictable than the books.The scene of everybody eating with their hands and grunting amused me.I\u2019m shipping Brienne and Tormund Rib-chewer. Davos is going to kill the Melisandre.I\u2019m surprised that they had Saint Tyrion the Goldenhearted, he of the Mellifluous, Badly-accented Voice allow slavery to continue. The show thus far as been very clear about it\u2019s SLAVERY IS BAD message. So, here is what is going to happen: Those whores that Tyrion sat on the slaver\u2019s laps? They are going to kill the slavers. Trust me. THERE WILL BE WAR.Oh, man. I\u2019m not surprised that she bit the big one(and how cliched was that?) but I hoped that Natalie Tena would have more scenes than that. She crackles on-screen like few of the actors in that series do. Bummer.Vaes Dothrak, well, my thoughts on the final scene are above. I found the Daario/Mormont scenes a bit lacklustre and ho-hum. However, not as much as other scenes this season.Jaime and especially Cersei actors had a bit more meat on the bone of their script to chew on, but it all seems so rushed and dull, still. I do assume that they will attack the Sept but I\u2019m not sure if that will play out well for Margaery and Loras who again is annoying in his wussiness as compared to the cocky but tough book Loras.", "My review is out of order and to entertain all of you, I cried at the beginning of the episode and then was screaming by the end of it. I tried not to put some spoilers-Sansa and Jon reuniting, Thanks to D & D, At least they united 2 Starks. Sansa showing character growth, apologizing to Jon, hanging out at the night's watch, and finally taking control of her own story with the push to march on Winterfell.High Sparrow backstory was good, I always like his bold and calm attitude. Ser Loras made a small appearance, sorry from him from all the book fans, And for all TV series fans- I tell you he is not just a gay man, he is a fighter, and that too a great one.My favorite scene was of Theon and Asha, But I feel like something weird is going to happen, like he's going to lay down his life for her. I feel like there has go be some \"greater purpose\" for him.Osha was playing the same game like always but Ramsay is not Theon.Things are going way too well for Littlefinger. But I don't think his campaign for Winterfell will be successful, since he's marching north with southern soldiers during winter (and also Sansa probably wants his head on a platter)Poor Jorah tried the pocket sand technique in a fight but it didnt go well. Thanks to Daario for saving one of my favorite characterI am not liking any Tyrion scenes, I know he will get a Emmy but still their is something off about them. And Missandai in them business pants, Who is designing clothes for her.What stole the show was \u2026Ohhh Dany\u2026.\"To go forward, you must go back.\" Dany's story circled back to the end of the first season. Dany. She is special, she is the mother of dragons and immune to fire. Not book Dany, but show Dany is. So please stop worrying book fans.Tormund eating seductively was without a doubt the highlight of the episode. Tormund doesn't break eye contact. Brienne might finally get broken in, He is the Giant\u2019s bane after all.and we are coming for you, Bastard", "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606I was going to give this episode 4 stars out of 5, because for the most part, I liked how things were happening - until the very end, a scene which was like someone pissing in a fairly decent bowl of soup.Spoilers if you haven\u2019t watched The Book of the Stranger yet.My favourite parts of the episode, as one could easily guess, were the events happening at Castle Black. It was refreshing to see two Starks together after such a long time, and their acknowledgement of their past was touching. Tormund appears to be seriously interested in Brienne, though she looked positively creeped out. I wanted to see how far Davos would go in confronting Melisandre, but Brienne interrupted before we could find out. It\u2019s sad to see that Sansa has to try so hard to convince Jon to reclaim Winterfell, especially after they got Ramsay\u2019s letter about Rickon. Maybe Jon did lose something at the resurrection. Speaking of Ramsay, while it was disappointing that we won\u2019t be seeing Osha again, I must admit that I was glad to see her go quickly.King\u2019s Landing was, well, let\u2019s say promising some action in the upcoming episodes. The Lannister-Tyrell alliance is appearing to be strengthened, mostly thanks to Cersei. When the High Sparrow started with his backstory about his cobbling days, I was really expecting a monologue that Septon Meribald would be proud of. But it was, at best, laughable - I thought he had seen what has war has done to the people, and that he would say something like what Mirri Maz Duur said to Dany - \u201cyou will burn down no more septs, your knights will not trample any more children into the dust\u201d - but no, he found religion after he got hungover and saw a lot of naked dudes. Laughable. There was one more sibling reunion - between Margaery and Loras - and the former\u2019s resolve is commendable. I was getting a lot of Reek vibes from Loras, however, in more ways than one.Things are brewing elsewhere in the Seven Kingdoms, with quick looks at the Vale and the Iron Islands. The show has finally revealed Littlefinger\u2019s true intentions, as he easily convinces young Robert Arryn to committing the Knights of the Vale against the Boltons. I\u2019m not sure if it would have been better or worse to leave it as a surprise, but based on the promo for the next episode, the real surprise is how Littlefinger is capable of travelling so fast! The third and final sibling reunion in this episode was at Pyke, where Theon appears almost magically, with no explanation given as to how he managed to get to the shore and hire a ship. We will have to wait and see what he is going to do next episode, which is going to be the Kingsmoot.Meereen was mostly mediocre, with Tyrion offering terms to Yunkai and Astapor, to the chagrin of the freed people of Meereen. I have a feeling that he is stalling, trying to cut the funding of the Sons by any means necessary, while he waits for Daenerys to return. The promo shows him taking further steps, allying with anyone who would help keep some order in the city.And finally, the fiasco. Vaes Dothrak was definitely the most anticipated part of this episode, with Jorah and Daario arriving to rescue Daenerys out of the hands of hundreds of thousands of angry warriors. Dany is shown to be making friends among sympathetic dosh khaleen, one of them anyway, while her rescuers somehow manage to make contact with her. When Dany refused to go with them, I knew she had a plan, which was also made clear by the smug look on her face when she has addressing the small congregation of khals. Surprisingly, they are so patient with her, finding her atrocious comments adorable. Next thing we know, she burns down the whole temple, and walks out of it naked and unburnt, while all the khals are dead. How convenient. More than anything else, I wonder how did that place catch on fire so quickly - did they construct it in such a way that a tipped over brazier would just bring the whole place down? I mean, I would have understood if it was dragonfire, but a bowl of burning coals? So she\u2019s immune to fire now. Sooner or later she is going to pull a Johnny Storm and go \u201cFlame on\u201d, I\u2019m sure.While Margaery quotes a line from it, giving the reason for this episode title, the final scene reveals the true meaning - the showrunners don\u2019t give a damn about the book of some stranger.3/10.", "I liked this episode. Going by the TV, and not on books, I loved this episode. Not thinking about deus ex machina part of the final scene,First things first in the first scene - the hug that made me so happy, Sansa and Jon reuniting. Everything was perfect in that scene. Sansa being truly happy in ages, Stark children meeting and reminiscing about old times, Sansa finding the fire in her belly (I\u2019ll take back Winterfell, with or without your help). Queen in the making!!!The pink letter is also here. So the two things I was waiting for to stop Jon from leaving Castle Black happened in the same episode. Now we wait for the planning phase on how to attack Boltons and their supporting houses.Was Brienne trying to antagonize Davos and Melisandre or was she just gloating in their misery? I thought D&D would reveal the truth about Shireen to Davos through her but the scene took another turn. And there was some serious heart eyes from Tormund to Brienne. One off thing or something being planned for future? you decide.At the opposite end - The Queen that has staked her claim. And it was done through another one of her larger than life feat which brought the entire Dothraki to their knees. Dany burned all the Khals and came unburnt from the flames. Clear message that she is near God mode in TV show and I find the possibility of her turning into an antagonist (in the show) infinitesimal. While the gesture and scene was as good as they can be when it comes to other grand scenes of Dany in the show, it just amused me to see the years of \u201cDany is not immune to fire\u201d going down the drain. Old weak poor Targaryens of the old who were killed by fire, Dany has no time for some weak-ass flames.The middle of the episode was not much to rave about but it started the wheel in motion for the coming episodes.LF has entered the frey and has secured his armies. I thought that he would descend upon the survivors of War of the Bastards, finish them off, and claim Wintefell for his own. But by the looks of promo of next episode, it seems that he is at Castle Black and may join Jon in a combined attack. Let Sansa slap him couple of times, please!! (did you knew about Ramsay?).Theon had a homecoming, not a happy one, with Yara fearing that he will make his claim for the throne. Theon was quick to alleviate her fears and the brother-sister had a tense reconciliation. The main villain should enter in the next episode.Meeren plot is having some parallels with last season story line at Wall. Tyrion wants to achieve lasting peace and understands that it will take a handshake to achieve that and not cutting the hand off, but slaves are having a hard time to understand his plan. Tyrion is also a fav of D&D so him sharing the fate of season 5 finale Jon is close to none, but will he get some kind of threat to his life? Anyway, this line of story will be moot as Dany is about to swoop in with her horde of Dothraki and quite possibly all three dragons to achieve peace in 7 min vs Tyrion\u2019s 7 years. There is your difference between a God and a mortal, at least in the TV show.Osha\u2019s fate was expected, she was well out of her depth when dealing with Ramsay, who also can do nothing wrong in the TV show.King\u2019s Landing is ripe with the tension of the battle that is about to come (promo scenes of season 6 with Tyrell army at the steps of Sept). Cersei has convinced Olenna and Kevan. Tommen is easily persuaded with anyone who talks with him for 5 mins and is not of a concern. The question to be discussed and debated is will their plan to attack Sept meet some debacle? As the scene with Lancel asking Cersei to order Gregor to stand aside doesn\u2019t align with Cersei\u2019s current scheme of attaching and successfully getting rid of High Sparrow.On a final note - Margaery showed her strength and wits by quickly understanding the plan of High Sparrow, but sadly Loras is broken. Even if he is rescued now, he may be of no use to anyone for a long time to come. This may be a parallel to the books, where he is of no use to anyone because of the injuries he received while storming Dragonstone.On an ending note, Please sir, May I have some more of Sansa and Jon avenging the Starks together for the rest of the season.", "This was the best episode of the season. [Spoilers ahead]Is Raksha Bandhan around the corner?An unnaturally high number of siblings reunite this episode.Sansa reaches the Wall before Jon can escape, and presumably postpones his retirement plans. Ramsay\u2019s deliciously villainous letter has the unintended result of getting Tormund riled up and he now faces a difficult battle against the free folk led by a free Jon.Margaery gets to see what\u2019s left of Loras and tries her best to mollify him. Loras seems to be beyond hope however, and if a confession is truly what the High Sparrow is after, it ought to be apparent that he is a much easier nut to crack than Margaery.The scene between Theon and Yara told us nothing we didn\u2019t already know \u2014 Theon is broken, has no interest in the throne, and will back his sister in the Kingsmoot.Not so little fingerAt the Vale, Baelish finally made an appearance. His act of gifting a falcon to his step-son Robin seemed ingenuous enough at first but was in fact an overt case of jury tampering. Having won the childish Robin\u2019s favor, Baelish uses it to threaten his guardian lord into submission and then to recruit him to his cause of marching on the North. Helping extinguish the Bolton family line is another pernicious masterstroke by Littlefinger, as it would redeem him not just in the eyes of Sansa but also the rulers down South.Given how far Baelish has come playing one piece off another, only something supernatural would prevent him from eventually sitting on the Iron Throne. And when that day should come, the Game of Thrones would lose its finest player.RealpolitikTyrion is putting to use the political chops he picked up in King\u2019s Landing, by cutting deals with the slave-masters in an attempt to buy peace. While Missandei and Greyworm\u2019s concerns are easy for him to dismiss, selling this scheme to Daenerys might be another beast altogether.Over in King\u2019s Landing, the ruling class put aside their differences for now in order to get rid of the populist uprising that could uproot their world order. For more on this, see my answer to Does Cersei's plan to deal with the Faith Militant have ulterior motives? If so, what are they?Daenerys takes a leaf out of Hanuman\u2019s bookBrought to Vaes Dothrak against her wishes and browbeaten by the sexist Khals and hardened Dosh Khaleen alike, Daenerys decides to finally give the rapists their comeuppance in a certified badass Khaleesi scene. I admit, when Dany started making her speech, I feared for her life and wondered how she planned to wriggle her way out of this conundrum. But unlike her clueless commanders, she actually had a plan; a plan to, in the words of her mad father, \u201cburn them all\u201d.In what is a stunning throwback to the season one finale, the episode ends with a majestic shot of the Dothraki bowing to Dany, who has once again come out of a fire unburnt and (to the collective cheer of prurient teenagers around the world) naked.Closing thoughtsWith only 19 episodes left in the show, creaters Benioff & Weiss have reached unprecedented levels of ruthlessness, killing off one secondary character after the other. I personally love this as all three murders so far (Doran, Roose and now Osha) have been bonafide shock moments.The limited time left has also ensured that a number of primary storylines have begun intersecting and slowly approaching their respective climaxes. It can\u2019t be long now before we see all the big face-offs.Of course, while the petty humans settle their scores and grapple over territory, the biggest threat of them lurks out of sight, biding his time, waiting to strike.", "(Show Spoilers)This episode was designed to interest us. It anticipated that many fans would be wondering: Where is Littefinger? What is going on with Daenarys Targaryen? Will Meereen survive the Sons of the Harpy? What happened to poor Robin Arryn? When is Margaery going to figure out how to beat the High Sparrow at his own game?And all I wanted to do was stay with Sansa and Jon Snow.That is the best part of the episode. Sansa comes to the Night\u2019s Watch before Jon Snow leaves. So his dark night of the soul has begun to abate. Brienne makes sure to tell Melissandre and Davos about the death of Stannis, so the show has finally wiped their hands of Stannis Baratheon. Melissandre commits herself to Jon Snow as she is sure he is the Prince that is Promised, while Davos reminds her that she thought the same of Stannis\u2014that was good timing on his part. And Jon Snow finally gets the pink letter\u2014come and see. His sense of purpose exists with a fervor. Rickon is a prisoner, and Ramsay decides to insult every Wilding while Tormund, not much of a reader, hears the letter aloud. So the Battle of the Bastards has been set in motion. The show seems to care about this story very much.But we have other stories. I suppose the show put a lot of money into making Dany look like the Terminator. Littlefinger is all but ruler in the Vale, and he plans to help Sansa, but we know it isn\u2019t out of altruism. Cersei wants to stop the High Sparrow with the help of her uncle and a determined Olenna Tyrell. Jaime is still not doing much of anything, while his little brother is meeting with the slavers to make some accord about their economic rights while Grey Worm and Missandei fume. The Ironborn were gone before my eyes adjusted to the screen. Loras Tyrell has been broken by the Faith Militant\u2014how? I want to know the purpose of that crazy storyline. Margaery may be the only live wire left in King\u2019s Landing. Daario really likes one of his knives, we find out. Yeah.I found the episode to be dull, dull, dull. And no, I don\u2019t need shock, death, boobs, butts, and cool CGI. I need a good story. I need characters to behave like they aren\u2019t sleepwalking. The episode is burning through storylines without giving time for us to even connect the dots. This was very disappointing. Does the show only have one good storyline left\u2014the Starks? What is happening to Game of Thrones?", "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 - Why 4/5 : The last scene \u201d Dany isn\u2019t supposed to be immune to fire. That\u2019s a fact that GRRM himself confirmed. But its TV show and Who cares\u2026Note: I\u2019m reviewing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from the perspective of someone who has read all of George R.R. Martin\u2019s novels.There are lots of reviews to I\u2019m just summing up mine:Verdict:A part of what makes the theme of forgiveness so strong in \u201cBook of the Stranger\u201d is the way the episode delineates between the slights you should forgive because they\u2019re truly past, the injuries you forgive for strategic reasons and the sins so grave that they make resolution truly impossible.All told, a really strong episode of Game of Thrones. I don\u2019t have a lot of complaints. I loved the family reunion at Castle Black. I loved Dany finally getting her groove back and defeating her enemies. But, as mentioned earlier it doesn\u2019t happened the way many os us expected. I hope it\u2019s a sign of her taking charge and just beating the crap out of her enemies in Slaver\u2019s Bay so she can move on to Westeros.Theon and Yara had such a brief scene, I didn\u2019t feel like flying all the way to the Iron Islands to talk about it this week. Suffice to say, Yara needed to lay off a bit and show some sympathy. Theon\u2019s been through a hell nobody could possibly understand. I was glad to see him lend her his support, and I\u2019m eager to get on with that plot and see what happens with it. The Iron Islands have been much ignored in this show, and I\u2019m curious where it all leads.I didn\u2019t like how Davos began questioning Melisandre about Princess Shireen and then got sidetracked by Brienne\u2019s entrance. That needs to be addressed, and soon. If nothing else, Davos will think better of Brienne when he learns what horrors Stannis finally stooped to (even if I will never forgive the showrunners for so badly mangling Stannis.) How Davos will react, and what he might try to do to Melisandre, remains to be seen. But he needs to know that a little girl was murdered for the red priestess\u2019 quest.I was even less fond of Tyrion\u2019s scenes, but maybe he\u2019ll surprise me. and I quite believe he\u2019ll. I also didn\u2019t care for Ramsay and Osha\u2019s scene. We don\u2019t need to keep seeing Ramsay do bad things to remember he\u2019s a villain. That\u2019s firmly established. Killing a Wildling woman who we haven\u2019t seen in two seasons with a knife is nowhere near as shocking or horrible as what he did to his father\u2019s wife and his little half-brother anyways.And yes we are coming for you, Bastard\u2026 waiting for Bastard-bowl. Who else?Thanks for A2A Monu Kamble.", "It was the best episode of the season so far to me. Things are definitely unfolding like I thought they would so far.Biggest surprise for me was Brienne confirming that she killed Stannis and also issuing a not so idle threat to Melisandre, which may make for some interesting conflict.It was kind of a weird transition how Melisandre just went from manic to casually believing Jon is \u2018the one\u2019. I found it interesting she actually is now calling him \u2018the prince that was promised\u2019 instead of Azor Ahai.Sansa is finally having her Furiosa moment, which is great. I wonder how Littlefinger is going to weasel out of selling out Sansa when she confronts him?I was actually expecting Drogon to show up and confirm the Stallion that mounts the world prophecy at the burning house, but I guess it wasn\u2019t in the budget. I\u2019m probably in the minority, but I am actively rooting against Dany. I don\u2019t like her character at all and I think the Targaryens are villains. Dragons are bad.I\u2019m really not liking the Kings Landing story arc. I already figured Olenna was going to come in and get her grandchildren, but I don\u2019t really like how they are making it seem like Cersei is the brains of the operation, when the entire Faith Militant problem is her fault to begin with. I have a feeling that Tommen is now on the death clock since Cersei\u2019s trial is coming up.Meereen is still a mess. I feel they changed too much of the book version to actually make it interesting. Its at least good to see Tyrion back in a Hand role which hes best at. They could have at least fleshed out the slavery sidebar by going more indepth with Missandei and Greyworm\u2019s relationship. I don\u2019t like how they only use their characters in an oblivious capacity. They are really missing an opportunity to flesh out the heart of that conflict.I have a feeling that Rickon\u2019s days may also be numbered. We all know Ramsay will get his due and be treated like a mad dog, but I think hes going to take Rickon with him. I still think a version of the Great Northern Conspiracy will happen. I think Ramsay may even be double-crossed and the Umbers will give him their own version of the Red Wedding.It looks like Bran has been relegated to being the flash back machine. Kind of a let down to have him go all that way to be used as a plot hole filling device.", "Some brilliant reviews here.Here's mine, and I won't be summarising the episode as some of the answers here have taken care of that.The major theme of this episode seems to sibling reunions.First things first, I cried happy tears when Jon & Sansa met. You could see it in Sansa's eyes the trepidation, the anxiety of whether she'll get to see her brother (half, anyway), after travelling all that distance. Is he really there? Will she finally reunite with a family member? And bam! there he is. Their meeting is a welcome relief after all the hits & misses that we've seen of the Stark kids over the 5-odd seasons. Though, honest question: did Sansa really tower over Jon while hugging or did he lift her up? Either way, looked a bit weird. The conversation that follows is amazing, though. Reminiscing and regrets, and a bit of forgiveness for perceived injuries. Sweet! Also, what is interesting is the way Sansa's character has shaped up. She seems to have made up her mind to take back Winterfell and rightfully so, after having endured the horrors right from King's Landing to Winterfell under the Boltons. She reminds Snow of the Wildlings who would back him and this shows the level of thought she's given to the matter. Epic character arc.Margaery & Loras. A resilient Margaery and a completely shattered Loras, in the dungeons of the High Sparrow. Quite interesting, though the High Sparrow plot is slowly becoming an unnecessary distraction in the larger scheme of things.And finally, the meeting of Theon & Yara. She's disappointed in him to say the least, and he's repentant. Will need to see whether Theon's support to Yara actually matters or not at the Kingsmoot coming up in the next episode.Tyrion and the Meereen plot doesn't add up to much. Except with Tyrion mouthing some clever lines. And really, Varys appeared just for one scene and didn't have a single line to say. What a sheer waste of talent! Wake up, D&D. This plot can really use a lot of improvements.Dynamic conversation between Davos, Melisandre and Brienne. Melisandre looks cornered by both Davos & Brienne, and Davos is left speechless when he comes to know that Brienne executed Stannis. Melisandre's probably shitting bricks when Davos asks her about Shireen. A little late in the day, don't you think? Whatevs.Dany, Jorah & Daario. Sigh! D&D are pyromaniacs. Seriously, she's the \"unburnt\"? Come on, GRRM was quite clear when he rubbished this theory, but no, D&D want Dany to emerge as the true hero (with boobs on display for added imagery). Not. It seems inconceivable that none of the Khals even touched Dany when she was on the brazier dropping spree. So what if they didn't have any weapons?! None of them even lunge at her. Great, big savage brutes that they are. Unbelievable shit. And wait a minute, what about Drogon? He was supposed to rescue Dany! So much for that, you sneaky trailer. Maybe the budget got exhausted in the pyrotechnics and they couldn't spring for Drogon to carry Dany, again. Maybe. Speaking of dragons, what happened to the ones Tyrion freed?Finally, the pink letter stuff. Predictable. Let's move on. We know there's a Bastard Bowl in the offing. Let's get to it NAAAOOW.The Lannisters-Tyrell, slimeball Littlefinger & the Ramsay & Osha plotlines don't warrant any of my time. Though, I can't wait for Sansa to cause Littlefinger's downfall.Arya and Bran don't appear in this episode at all. I expected at least Arya's plot to move forward this week, but looks like it'll happen next week. I eagerly await the leap in Bran's story in the next episode, which seems to be heading in a very exciting direction.So my rating for the episode, 3.5 out of 5. Extra 0.5 attributable to the eyes Tormund makes at Brienne while eating which makes her recoil and causes Dolorous Edd to shudder. Funny!", "One of the best shows of the season which I have watched so farSpoilers alertJon and Sansa finally met and their hugging scene marks for an emotional moment.I wonder how much love they have felt for each other after years of IsolationLittle finger had gone to House Arryn and manipulates the king of the house who is Catelyn\u2019s nephew .He has something different in Mind.

I was looking forward to the Sansa - Ghost reunion just as much. And why isn\u2019t Ghost hanging around with Jon after he is resurrected? Is D&D trying to give us a clue about Jon or is it just about budget?The ugly,Dany is confirmed to be fire immune in the show. And the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen burns faster than a matchstick on a hot day. The fiercest warriors in Essos just scratching their &%$*^ waiting to be burnt.

Osha asks if he eats the skin of the people he flays. He smirks, and kills her, and then when he peels the skin of the next apple, he eats it. What is the audience to think?", "I thought it was great. Definitely the highlight of the season so far.The peak of the episode was the climax with Dany which people seem to be really bothered by. I get it, but I disagree.While this disagrees with what Martin has said about her abilities, there\u2019s literally been nothing important in the books so far that depends on her not being fire-proof, so unless there\u2019s something upcoming we don\u2019t know about, this was always Martin being pedantic. Love the man, in awe of his abilities, but we all know full well that he has Dany live through that fire at the end of the first book because it\u2019s an awe-inspiring scene, and realistically the character would be bound to try it again as needed afterward if she thought she had the ability - which she sure seemed to - and it was never realistic that she\u2019d wait even this long to do it.To me this is the TV show asking themselves, \u201cWait, why aren\u2019t we writing another scene like this?\u201d, and then realizing they had no good reason not to do it.Additionally, while I understand that the Dothraki have always made people feel uncomfortable from a colonialist perspective, if someone set the room on fire around me, I don\u2019t I\u2019d act all that rationally either. It\u2019s not about ignorant savages, it\u2019s about having your reality turned on its head, and the very reason people enjoy the season is that its as true for the audience as it is for the Khals.I think it\u2019s really nice to have Sansa & Jon not even reunited, but together for the first time - they never interacted before to my knowledge. I think it\u2019s a bit much to have the unite at the same time when Rickon comes back into the picture, but that\u2019s the kind of lack of subtlety I\u2019m used to with the show.I\u2019m hoping not-gone-Jon ends up being more interesting than simply a guy who is hesitant after getting hurt but then goes and wins a battle. I want him to actually surprise me in some kind of jaw-dropping way.", "The Daenerys segment was appropriately intense, with a decent ending. But the biggest problem with it was that Drogon is not involved. That seems incredible to me, especially given the name \u201cDrogon\u201d and the fact that he\u2019s Dany\u2019s metaphorical child - he\u2019s the \u201cStallion that Mounts the World\u201d. Drogon showing up to save her should be an incredibly auspicious sign, something that truly gets the Dothraki khalasars to bow before her in awe. But instead we get Dany walking naked out of the fire - a well-shot scene, but so much less than it could have been.The scenes in King\u2019s Landing were very good, with a particularly excellent scene in the Small Council room. The only flaw was (yet another) monologue from the High Septon which ran a tad long, and only served to remind us yet again that he\u2019s a religious fanatic.It was great to see Jon and Sansa re-unite, and I\u2019m glad that they\u2019re finally getting the \u201cwe should retake Winterfell\u201d plot underway. Most of all, I\u2019m incredibly happy that it\u2019s Sansa pushing for this - it\u2019s starting to resemble empowerment.In tandem with that, the show actually did a superb job of reintroducing the Vale and Littlefinger this episode, and getting them to march north to Winterfell and Sansa. The timing might not work out so well on that, but it\u2019s good that it\u2019s underway.Both Tyrion and Ramsay have the same problem, namely that they\u2019re the show\u2019s equivalent of the \u201cMereenese Knot\u201d from the books: they\u2019re treading water plot-wise, going nowhere and taking up valuable screen-time until other characters have been moved into the right positions by the plot. Ramsay\u2019s clearly not going anywhere until he dies in the rumored \u201cBastard Bowl\u201d battle (probably in the penultimate episode this season), and Tyrion doesn\u2019t appear to be in any sort of rush to leave. The latter is especially strange in light of his letting the dragons off their leash - when is the show planning to fire that particular Chekhov\u2019s Gun? But at least there\u2019s some rationale for him to continue getting screen-time, unlike with Ramsay . We get it, Game of Thrones showrunners - he\u2019s a bad guy, and we knew that before the last season even started. Did you think we were so enamored with Joffrey that everyone was begging for Joffrey 2.0?All in all, it was a good episode. I\u2019d give it a 4/5.", "Meaty: that\u2019s how I describe Season 6 Episode 4. Meaty and salty and leaving me thirsty for S6E5. This was the episode that felt like all the characters for whom I was crying \u201cgrow a pair\u201d came through. There was Sansa finally, finally saying here\u2019s our path to the future and we have to pull together. Sansa? Finally? Stopped combing her hair long enough to realize that if she left destiny to others again she\u2019d be back in the flaying-arms of that Bolton bastard. And there was Daenerys finally stepping away from her \u201clet\u2019s all get along\u201d detours freeing the slaves and getting freed herself. Without taking a moment to say thank you and give one of those thirsty boys a sweet kiss, she turned the tables on the Dothraki as the Mother of Dragons she is. Their arrogance has always been their weak point and they underestimated the pale beauty \u2014 won\u2019t happen again! And how wonderful to see Brienne of Tarth get a break after all that wasted nobility. I have always wondered why nobody has been able to unseat the Sparrow and his religious stranglehold over King\u2019s Landing \u2014 but now, finally, the disparate royal parties are beginning to coalesce. I mean: how could Tommen allow Margaery to remain another night in prison without a hairbrush and a good sarong? So, returning to the beginning of this very long paragraph, it is now time for Tommen to grow a pair, to face and to unseat a movement that in crusading against political corruption has grown fascistic. C\u2019mon, even Theon Greyjoy has returned to his home, a flayed and broken man but wise enough to know that it is now time to surrender his own ego and support his fierce and, in her own way, loving sister. And on to tonight, S6E5, and, I hope, more Arya in the mix.", "Since the episode has not aired yet , I do not know the things that will be happening in it. Especially even before episode three. But if you are asking me what could happen in it. , here's my guess. The episode three is named as Oathbreaker. This episode may heavily feature Jon Snow after revival. Note that his oaths to Nights Watch have ended now that he has died. And will they be applied back on his resurrected form ?Perhaps no. Perhaps yes. He is technically free from his vows but he is Jon Snow. The loyal Watcher in the Dark. This question arises because no other Lord Commander has ever been brought back. ( tell me if it is so)The book of Stranger\u00a0 , to me seems a Strange name. This episode might focus less on Jon and more on Daenerys or Tyrion. Tyrion and his books. \u200bThis episode will be having some parts of the rising complications in the North , now that Ramsay is Lord Bolton. Also we would lead forward to Cersie's Trail , which will be happening in the latter half ( episode 8?)\u00a0\u00a0 Some more head smashing by Robert Strong could be seen too.", "The speculations for the next episode can be:- The Stranger is one aspect of The Seven in the Faith of the Seven, the predominant religion of Westeros. He is the aspect of the Faith\u2019s god that represents the unknown and death.The Stranger is unique among the Seven in a few ways. While the other aspects of the Seven are human males or females, the Stranger is considered monstrous and does not have a defined gender (though he is referred to as male). As such, he is often depicted as a hooded figure with animalistic features.While follows of the Faith of the Seven frequently pay tribute to the various aspects of their god, few worship or offer tribute directly to the Stranger, finding him macabre and terrifying. Still, some societal outcasts identify with the Stranger, and he is considered one face of the Many-Faced God by the Faceless Men and devotees of the House of Black and White.The Faith\u2019s holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star, is split into books that correspond to the aspects of the Seven. As such, the Book of the Stranger is the book corresponding to the Stranger. The episode being named after the holy book of what is essentially Westeros\u2019s God of Death is ominous indeed.Another interesting note is that Sandor \u201cThe Hound\u201d Clegane\u2019s horse was named \u201cStranger,\u201d though no one was ever certain if Clegane name the horse afterthe Stranger. Still, there are theories that the Hound is still alive in Westeros, so you have to wonder if this is a sly hint planted by the showrunners.Source:-\u00a0 Game of Thrones: What Is The Book Of The Stranger?", "This is my first review of an episode this season so here goes.I found this episode to be very meh. It was unentertaining and felt like it was just going through the motions, giving us brief glimpses of the characters we love but nothing overly substantial in pyke, meereen, Brienne and kings landing.The best scenes involved Jon and Sansa. They felt the most natural or unforced. The same cannot be said for Danys bs way of becoming the great khaleesi of the dothraki.Personally I feel like the show is trying to juggle too many storylines and right now the show as a whole is suffering.Here's to hoping that by the end of the season they can right the ship because the first four episodes have been quite underwhelming to say the least.", "UPDATE After I\u2019ve watched the episode, I\u2019m so impressed! This episode is BRILLIANT, and by this time is the most epic, engaging and meaningful episode of the season (If we\u2019re speaking about the whole episode, not about the epic ending, such as in E02)Image Courtesy: TeiIku at Deviantart (Daenerys Targareyen)Daenerys\u2019s scene was really hot (in all senses), unexpactable and awesome. Her win was a shock for me, even though I was expecting that something WILL happen. Yeah, a simple escape by cover of night is not a MOTHER\u2019S OF DRAGONS way.I have no pity for dead Khals, but I want to assume that Daenerys is really cruel with her enemies. Being so merciless with 3 dragons and huge army behind her back will let her to gain the Iron Throne back. But I\u2019m not sure that Westeros will have a great time under her rule.JOHN, JOHN, JOHN AND FAMILY REUNIONIt was a sweet moment, when Sansa and John finally meet again. It was 5 seasons (!) ago, when they saw each other last time. Sansa finally understood, how silly she was, and John\u2026 After his resurrection he became a little bit emo. But with Sansa\u2019s help, he admitted that they have to claim their home back.Ramsay\u2019s letter (very similar to the original letter in the book) was a trigger to immediate actions. I\u2019m so thrilled to watch The Battle of the Bastards!Image Courtesy: Art by Erta\u00e7 Alt\u0131n\u00f6zOSHA\u2019S DEATHI expected that she will be killed, because after Ramsay had Rickon, there was no point in keeping her alive. However, the scene where she was trying to fool him and kill him was so promising!KING\u2019S LANDINGThe Sparrows, Tyrells, Lannisters\u2026 so boring. It would be nice if the High Sparrow would be killed (don\u2019t like this character at all), but while we have white walkers\u2019 threat in the North, and dragons\u2019 threat in the South, watching these political intrigue is not so pleasing.Hope, Margaery will be okay. Actually, when Tommen was saying something like that \u201cMa, High Septon talked to me and\u2026.\u201d I was expecting that Margaery is already pregnant, and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t hurt her so much as her brother and will let her to go out of the dungeon.This situation would be a nice +1 strike to Cercey\u2019s back. Because in this situation, she will be not only a mother of the king, but a grandmother to a future king (very lol situation for her, who is so feared of loosing her power and beauty)=======Here is my main speculations, written before the Episode was aired:======Speaking of the title, I'm 99% sure, that it's about The Stranger - is one face of The Seven-in-One God, representing the death and the unknown. Maybe the Book of the Stranger is some kind of the list, which contains dead people or men, who are destined to die.So it could be an allegory of someone's death, which is going to happen in the next episode (oh, what a surprise, isn't it? :) As for me, this title is should reveal us something concerning Arya in The House of Black and White as the Faceless Men respect the Stranger (unlike others). But in the episode description there's no any mention of Arya, so let it be more about allegory and metaphorical meaning.Besides, this title could be connected with the Sparrows, his leader The High Sparrow, The Faith of the Seven and fates of Margaery and Loras.So what we'll see in the episode?Tyrion, who will try to find new allies (as I think he is going to find a help from the mercenaries in exchange for some gold/other benefits) TRUEJorah and Daario that will fight for Dayneris ( I assume that one of them will die, as for me it will be Mormont *cry face*)TRUE (ACTUALLY, DAYNERIS CAN TAKE CARE ABOUT HERSELF ON THE HIGH LEVEL, BUT WITHOUT JORAH, DAAARIO AND THAT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG KHALEESI DANY\u2019S EPIC SCENE COULD NOT HAPPEN EVER)Jaime and Cersei will try to 'show their power' and probably Olenna will confront with them. Maybe we'll see a suspiocious death of the Kevan Lannister (and Cersei will think, that it was planned by Tyrells) NOT SO TRUE, AS OLENNA SUPPORTED LANNYSTERS AND THERE WAS NO KEVAN\u2019S DEATH/PARTLY TRUEHope, you've enjoyed my guesswork!", "As most of us are aware of the seven gods, The Stranger is an aspect of the Seven. He is rarely prayed to and represents death and the unknown. The other aspects of the Seven are depicted and represented by a human form but the Stranger is often portrayed in a wide variety, often frightening.Though it will be a long-shot but the coincidence that the Stranger might be a representation of the Others (White Walkers) and somehow Sam Tarly finds a book about them in Old Town. Must be a good read and highly recommended in the days to come in Westeros.Will have to wait and (nights)watch!!", "I always recap each episode of Game of Thrones, and this week is no different. Those reunions! That fire! My most important takeaway? Is Daenerys\u2019 hair fireproof?It was an awesome episode\u2026just enough spark and enough exposition. It was a vast improvement over the previous week\u2019s hour, but then again, how do you top Jon Snow coming back to life? You can\u2019t\u2026you need to have a filler episode to make way for a show like \u201cBook of the Stranger.\u201dTo read more of my snarky recap, feel free to read my entire review on my blog: http://seeheresthething.com/s6e4...", "forget about the the GOT download the app : goo.gl/8c1zlI"]}, "55": {"id": "s06e05", "name": "The Door", "script": "(theme music playing)   (knock at door)  - Sansa: Yes? - (door opens)  For you, my lady.  How far is Mole's Town?  (footsteps)  Sansa.  Lady Brienne.  When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.  You have no idea how happy I am  to see you unharmed.  Unharmed?  What are you doing here?  I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid.  They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.  To come to my aid?  Did you know about Ramsay?  If you didn't know, you're an idiot.  If you did know, you're my enemy.  Would you like to hear about our wedding night?  He never hurt my face.  He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter.  But the rest of me,  he did what he liked with the rest of me  as long as I could still give him an heir.  What do you think he did?  I can't begin to contemplate--  What do you think he did to me?  Lady Sansa asked you a question.  He beat you.  Yes, he enjoyed that.  What else do you think he did?  - Sansa, I-- - What else?  Did he cut you?  - Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along. - I didn't know.  I thought you knew everyone's secrets.  I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.  I underestimated a stranger.  The other things he did,  ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things,  but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.  I can still feel it.  I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.  I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.  I'm so sorry.  You said you would protect me.  And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.  I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore.  You can't protect me.  You won't even be able to protect yourself  if I tell Brienne to cut you down.  And why shouldn't I?  Do you want me to beg for my life?  If that's what you want, I will.  Whatever you ask that is in my power,  I will do.  What if I want you to die here and now?  Then I will die.  You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family  and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family.  Go back to Moat Cailin.  My brother and I will take back the North on our own.  I never want to see you again.  I would do anything to undo what's been done to you.  I know that I can't.  Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go?  Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish  has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.  You might consider seeking him out.  The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.  I have an army.  Your brother's army.  Half-brother.  (staves clacking)  (grunting)  You're not ready.  You should go home before it's too late.  (grunts)  (grunts)  (grunts)  You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.  She has a point.  None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies.  They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.  Who was the first?  He was no one.  The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face  and how to give the gift.  The man taught others in exchange for their service.  Many served, many more gifts were given.  Soon all the masters and overseers were gone  and the Faceless Men fled.  Where did they go?  Here.  They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house.  These were the faces they wore in life  when they were not wearing others.  The first Faceless Men.  And now a girl is one of them,  if a girl desires.  A girl has no desires.  Who?  An actress who calls herself Lady Crane.  She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square.  A girl has been given a second chance.  There will not be a third.  One way or another,  a face will be added to the hall.  (applause)  (horn blows)  (crowd laughs)  - (farts) - Ahh!  Oh, murdered by a boar.  The great big hairy whore.  He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts  and soon I am no more.  Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie.  I love you, Father. Please don't die.  - Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine. - (laughs)  I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land.  And our son alone on that cold, cold throne  without a guiding hand.  Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace?  To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?  Ned Stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.  - (crowd laughs) - (footsteps)  Ooh!  Ooh, what's happened here, then?  He brought you here, Ned Stark,  'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land.  You should be king of us all  and I should be your Hand.  We men of the North are right good hands  at keeping people lawful.  I'd ask him for permission,  but he smells too bloody awful.  - (screams) - (crowd laughs)  I die! I die!  And here I now must lie.  Oh, woe. Oh, no.  - (farts) - (laughing)  Oh, I am about to go.  (farting)  Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?  The Iron Throne's what I demand.  - You cannot. - I can.  - You will not. - I will.  - You dare not. - I dare yes.  - The line of succession. - What's that mean?  - The proper progression. - What's that mean?  - The lawful ascension. - What's that mean?  (laughing)  - (music playing) - (cheering)  So move along, give me my chair  and there won't be no more trouble.  - (grunts) - (crowd laughs)  But we had a deal all done and dusted.  I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.  (laughter, applause)  Save my father.  Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.  - Save him, please. - Show him mercy.  Show the people what a good king should be.  Good people, you may all relax.  My father's friend shall be spared the--  - (audience gasps) - (gasps)  - (music playing) - Sansa actor: Father! No!  Oh, Father. Oh!  (laughter)  Tyrion actor: Worry not!  All is well.  I have here a decree  from my father Tywin Lannister,  the richest man you'll see.  He proclaims me Hand of the King.  The position's mine for life.  And he's given me permission to take  Sansa as my wife.  - (screams) - (crowd booing)  You'll learn that what I lack in height,  - I make up for in appetite. - (screams)  So let's forget about your plight,  and go rehearse our wedding night.  - (music playing) - (applause)  It's a wart. Two warts.  I've got two fucking warts on my cock.  Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.  Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.  You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.  I had two lines.  There are no small parts. You rang very false.  I rang very false?  What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.  (laughs)  Bianca: You weren't complaining about me last night.  Tyrion actor: May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?  Lady Crane: I'm a rum girl, Bobono.  You need to know that if we're going to be intimate.  Of course we're going to be intimate.  It's only a matter of time.  (rum pouring)  To our children.  May they have your talent.  And your filthy mind.  (chuckles)  A girl will poison the rum.  Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.  If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall  A girl is not ready.  She's a good actress.  So a man has heard.  Seems like a decent woman.  Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?  No.  Who wants her dead?  That does not matter. The price was paid.  The younger actress.  She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.  A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.  A girl has decided.  A servant does not ask questions.  (raven cawing)  (ravens cawing)  (voices whispering)  - (raven caws) - (whispering continues)  (whispering)  (breathing heavily)  No! No! No!  (screaming)  (screaming stops)  (ice crackling)  (gasps)  It was you.  You made the white walkers.  We were at war.  We were being slaughtered.  Our sacred trees cut down.  We needed to defend ourselves.  From whom?  From you.  From men.  Aeron: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God.  In his name we gather today  to choose a new king as our leader.  Who makes a claim?  I am Yara Greyjoy,  daughter of Balon Greyjoy,  King of the Iron Islands.  I claim the Salt Throne.  We've never had a queen. Not once.  There are many things we've never done.  We've never made our mark upon the world.  The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind  until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms  long enough to become a nuisance.  Then they swat us down.  They conquer us, humiliate us,  and go right back to forgetting we exist.  Men: Aye!  - We are a sea people. - Aye!  - Our god is a sea god. - Aye!  When I am queen, we will build a fleet that--  - You shall not be queen! - I am not finished!  Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us.  Not when Balon's own male heir has returned.  I am Theon Greyjoy  last living son of Balon Greyjoy.  And she is your rightful ruler.  Men: Aye!  Those of you that have sailed under her,  and there are many of you here,  - you know what she is. - Aye!  - She is a reaver. - Aye!  - She is a warrior. - Aye!  She is ironborn!  Aye!  We will find no better leader.  This is our queen.  (men cheering)  (men chanting) Yara! Yara! Yara!  I'm Euron Greyjoy.  I claim the Salt Throne.  (men murmuring)  Niece.  Nephew.  Little Theon.  Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground.  (men chuckle)  Captured a castle you couldn't keep.  Got yourself taken prisoner.  Even heard you have no cock.  (men laugh)  Explains why you think a woman can be king.  When did you return, Uncle?  A few days ago.  I had some things to take care of.  Long overdue.  I'm glad you're here.  Now I know what my first act as queen will be.  To execute the man who killed my father.  (men murmuring)  I did.  I killed him.  Threw him right over a rope bridge  and watched him fall.  He was leading us nowhere  and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me.  No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him.  He led us into two wars we couldn't win.  I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.  That would have been hard to do.  You weren't here.  Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.  Gallivanting?  That the sort of thing you start to say  - once your dick gets chopped off? - (men laugh)  Did the great lords of Westeros teach you words like that?  You were gone.  Yara was here.  Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.  Getting ready to bring us back to glory.  Euron: And how will she do that?  I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.  Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet  because I'm the one who knows how to use it.  I've been all over the world.  I've seen more of it than all of you combined.  And across the sea there is a person  who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.  Someone with a large army,  three large dragons, and no husband.  I'm going to build that fleet  and I'm going to gallivant right over  and give it to Daenerys Targaryen  - along with my big cock. - (men laugh)  You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?  I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her.  And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.  I wasn't born to be king.  I paid the iron price  and here I stand.  (cheering)  (men chanting) Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!  Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!  Euron! Euron!  May Euron, your servant, be born again  from the sea as you were.  Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone.  Bless him with steel.  Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.  He is speaking to us and he says  we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.  Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away.  Let the old Euron drown.  Let his lungs fill with seawater.  Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.  What is dead may never die,  but rises again harder and stronger.  (gagging, coughing)  (gasping)  What is dead may never die.  All: What is dead may never die.  (cheers)  Where are my niece and nephew?  Let's go murder them.  Aeron: They stole our best ships.  Won't be enough to save them.  Go back to your homes.  Chop down every tree you can find.  Quarter-saw the timber and start building.  I want every man bending planks.  I want every woman spinning flax for sails.  Build me a thousand ships  and I will give you this world.  I banished you twice.  You came back twice.  And you saved my life.  So I can't take you back  and I can't send you away.  You must send me away.  Is there a cure?  I don't know.  How long does it take?  I don't know that either.  But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough.  I'll end things before that.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Don't be.  All I've ever wanted was to serve you.  Tyrion Lannister was right.  I love you.  I'll always love you.  Good-bye, khaleesi.  Do not walk away from your queen,  Jorah the Andal.  You have not been dismissed.  You pledged yourself to me.  You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.  Well, I command you to find the cure  wherever it is in this world.  I command you to heal yourself  and then return to me.  When I take the Seven Kingdoms,  I need you by my side.  In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters,  how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?  None.  And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men?  Two, but that was the day of the pact.  Since then, nothing.  So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.  For now.  For now is the best we get in our profession.  It's not enough.  Considering the city was on the brink of civil war,  I'd say it's a good start.  It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.  They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.  The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.  Resist the foreign invaders.  Our queen has an even better story.  Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.  The people know who brought them freedom.  Yes, but do they know who brought them security?  Who brought about an end to the violence?  We need someone the people trust,  someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.  Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?  Who said anything about \"him\"?              That's about the extent of my Valyrian.  Thank you for travelling all this way.  I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.  The truth is we need your help.  We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to--  You don't need to persuade me.  I came to help.  Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised.  From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.  Yes.  She has freed the slaves from their chains  and crucified the Masters for their sins.  She did indeed.  Her dragons are fire made flesh,  a gift from the Lord of Light.  But you heard all of this before, haven't you?  On the Long Bridge of Volantis.  The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands,  burning their sins and flesh away.  Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers.  The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.  You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed.  And while she's gone, you want her advisors  to be worshipped and obeyed.  I'd settle for obeyed.  I will summon my most eloquent priests.  They will spread the word.  Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness  in this war and in the great war still to come.  That sounds most excellent.  A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed  as the chosen one by one of your priestesses.  He, too, had a glorious destiny.  He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated  by the man standing beside me.  Last I had heard, he had been defeated again,  this time at Winterfell and this time for good.  We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.  I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake.  Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic?  You're always right.  Everything is the Lord's will.  Everything is the Lord's will.  But men and women make mistakes.  Even honest servants of the Lord.  And you, an honest servant of the Lord,  why should I trust you to know any more  than the priestess who counseled Stannis?  My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,  but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.  Everyone is what they are  and where they are for a reason.  Terrible things happen for a reason.  Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child.  If not for your mutilation  at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,  you wouldn't be here helping the Lord's Chosen  bring his light into the world.  Knowledge has made you powerful.  But there's still so much you don't know.  Do you remember what you heard that night  when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire?  You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember?  Should I tell you what the voice said?  Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?  We serve the same queen.  If you are her true friend,  you have nothing to fear from me.  (raven caws)  (wind howling)  What?  (gasps)  (gasps)  (screams)  He saw me, the Night King!  - He saw me! - He touched you.  I don't know. He was close, but--  He touched you.  He knows you are here. He'll come for you.  But he can't get in.  He can now. His mark is on you.  You must leave, all of you.  Meera: Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.  Hodor.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.  - The time has come. - The time for what?  For you to become me.  But am I ready?  No.  We can't defend the north from the walkers  and the south from the Boltons.  If we want to survive, we need Winterfell  and to take Winterfell, we need more men.  Davos: Aside from the Starks and the Boltons,  the most powerful houses in the North  are the Umbers, the Karstarks,  and the Manderlys.  The Umbers and the Karstarks  have already declared for the Boltons,  so we're not doing so well there.  The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang.  But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay  without knowing they had another choice.  I beg your pardon, my lady,  but they know that a Stark beheaded their father.  I don't think we can count on them either.  How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?  Precious little, my lady.  My father always said Northerners are different.  More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.  They may well be loyal,  but how many rose up against the Boltons  when they betrayed your family?  I may not know the North, but I know men.  They're more or less the same in any corner of the world  and even the bravest of them don't want to see  their wives and children skinned for a lost cause.  If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him,  they need to believe it's a fight they can win.  There are more than three other houses in the North--  Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,  Mazin, Hornwood.  Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others.  We can start small and build.  Sansa: The North remembers.  They remember the Stark name.  People will still risk everything for it,  from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.  I don't doubt it.  But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.  No, but I do.  Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son  as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.  And there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern,  but they will back us against the Boltons without question.  I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.  My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it  and retaken Riverrun.  How do you know that?  Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.  That's good.  The Blackfish is a legend.  His support would mean a great deal.  Stark, Tully, a few more houses,  almost starts to look like a winning side.  I've sworn to protect you, my lady.  You heard them. We need more men  and my uncle has an army.  We can send the Blackfish a raven.  Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.  It has to be you.  Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you  and you'll know how to talk to him.  What is it?  I don't like leaving you here alone.  With Jon?  Not him. He seems trustworthy.  A bit brooding, perhaps.  I suppose that's understandable, considering.  The others, though.  Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother  with bloodmagic.  And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they?  Already out looking for a leader with better prospects.  And that wildling fellow with the beard--  Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman  or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.  He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him.  Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?  New dress?  I made it myself. Do you like it?  Yeah, it's-- I like the wolf bit.  Good, because I made this for you.  I made it like the one Father used to wear.  As near as I can remember.  Thank you, Sansa.  You're welcome.  Don't knock it down while I'm gone.  I'll do my best.  Good luck.  Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?  I'm not the Lord Comman--  yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.  (raven caws)  Meera: We can go home now, Hodor.  Well, maybe not home home,  but somewhere that isn't a cave.  (chuckles) Hodor.  Eat something that isn't moss.  I want an egg. How do you like 'em?  Boiled? Fried up with some butter?  (laughs) Hodor.  With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.  Hodor.  Get Bran and run!  (white walkers snarling)  Bran. Bran, wake up.  - Bran. - Hodor. Hodor.  Bran, wake up.  - Man: Gods keep you on the kingsroad. - Woman: Take it easy.  Watch yourself.  Hodor.  Hodor. Hodor.  Help me!  (shouts)  Leaf: Go!  Go!  (shrieking)  Rickard: Remember that you are a Stark.  Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale  and try to stay out of fights.  Yes, Father.  But if you have to fight, win.  Bran! Bran, wake up!  (snarling)  (grunts)  (branches breaking)  - (screams) - (growls)  Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.  - Bran! Bran, wake up! - Hodor. Hodor.  You have to wake up.  - We need Hodor. - Hodor. Hodor.  Meera: Bran, we need Hodor.  Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.  (screaming)  - (shrieks) - Hodor. Hodor.  (snarling)  Bran, we're all going to die!  Meera: Bran, wake up!  We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!  Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.  Hodor. Hodor.  Warg into Hodor now!  Bran, wake up. We need Hodor.  We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!  Listen to your friend, Brandon.  Hodor: Hodor. Hodor.  Hodor. Hodor.  Hodor. Hodor.  (shrieks)  (gasps)  (groans)  (Summer barking)  (growling)  - Summer! - Leaf: Go.  Go!  (yelping)  (snarling)  Three-Eyed Raven: The time has come.  Leave me.  - What are you doing? - Go!  (snarling)  (snarling)  (grunts)  - Hodor, hurry! - (grunts)  Hodor!  Hold the door!  Meera: Hold the door!  Hold the door!  Hold the door!  (thumping)  (wights snarling)  Hold the door!  - Meera: Hold the door! - Nan: Wylis!  What's the matter?  - Hold the door! - Come on, son.  Hold the door!  - (snarling continues) - (shouts)  (screams)  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold the door!  Hold the door!  Hold the door!  Hold the door! Hold the door!

Summary At the Wall The Door 05 Sansa refuses Littlefinger's offer.  Sansa Stark receives a message bearing the sigil of House Baelish, asking her to a meeting in Mole's Town. Accompanied by Brienne, Sansa furiously confronts Petyr Baelish, asking if he was aware what Ramsay Bolton was capable of. Baelish deflects, saying he has the knights of The Vale waiting at Moat Cailin to aid Sansa. She is mistrustful of him when he claims he had no idea of Ramsay's abusive treatment of her. Sansa describes her wedding night and what Ramsay did, Littlefinger looks on in silent horror and apologizes to her, offering to protect her now. She doubts Baelish's ability to protect her or even himself, threatening to have Brienne kill him. He says he'll do whatever she asks and Sansa tells him to leave and never come back for her. He obeys, but not before informing that her great-uncle Brynden Tully has recaptured Riverrun and recommending she seek him out and the remaining loyal Tully forces. Sansa says she already has an army, her brother Jon Snow's army of wildlings. \"Half-brother,\" Baelish clarifies as he walks away.  At Castle Black, a war council is called, and is attended by Sansa, Brienne, Podrick, Jon, Davos, Melisandre, Tormund and Eddison Tollett, who discuss the need for more men to defend Castle Black, since the Karstarks and Umbers, two major Houses in the North, have declared for Ramsay. Jon points out that they can summon the rest of the minor Houses, such as the Mormonts, Glovers, Cerwyns, and Mazins, to rival their enemies. Sansa states that \"the North remembers\" - the people of the North are still loyal to the Starks and will risk everything for the name Stark. She reveals Brynden's successful retaking of Riverrun, though she claims she learned via one of Ramsay's ravens in order to stop Jon from pursuing Littlefinger. Sansa subsequently tasks Brienne and Podrick with securing Brynden's help while the rest of them leave Castle Black to start building their army. Before leaving Castle Black, Sansa presents Jon with a new cloak like their father's, carrying the Stark sigil.  In Braavos The Waif continues to drill Arya, mocking her high-born origins. Jaqen H\u2019ghar explains that the Faceless Men were slaves in Valyria before establishing the Free City of Braavos and the House of Black & White. Handing Arya a vial, Jaqen tells her an actress, Lady Crane, will be the next to receive the Many-Faced God\u2019s \u201cgift.\u201d  The Door 31 Arya watches The Bloody Hand, a stage-play in Braavos loosely based on the recent civil wars in Westeros.  Arya enjoys the spectacle of the actors re-enacting the War of the Five Kings, playing Baratheons and Lannisters, but her pleasure ceases when her father, and his execution, are inaccurately caricatured. Eddard is portrayed as a buffoon, and the actress who plays Sansa has her breasts bared to the audience. Arya sneaks into the dressing room after the play to observe her target \u2013 the actress playing Cersei \u2013 who appears to be a clever, decent woman. Arya later shares with Jaqen her plan to poison Lady Crane\u2019s rum, which no one else in the troupe drinks. Arya suspects that a jealous younger actress, Bianca, has commissioned the kill. Jaqen cuts her off, reminding her a servant does not question.  In Vaes Dothrak The Door 35 Jorah shows his arm to Daenerys.  Daenerys is unsure of what to do with Jorah, having banished him twice, seeing him defiantly return twice, and him twice saving her life. Jorah finally confesses his love for Daenerys, but also reveals his spreading greyscale infection, and says that this time, he needs to leave for good. He starts to leave and states his plan to take his own life well before the greyscale envelops him, but Daenerys tearfully commands him to find a cure and come back to her side when she conquers Westeros. Jorah then departs while Daenerys and Daario Naharis lead the Dothraki horde back to Meereen.  In Meereen Kinvara introduced mereen the door Kinvara, the High Red Priestess.  While the rulers of Meereen enjoy a tenuous peace, Tyrion reminds them of the need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys's blessing, as the Masters could use Tyrion and Varys's foreign status against them to reclaim Slaver's Bay. To that end, Tyrion invites Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, to negotiate spreading the word of Daenerys's accomplishments. To Tyrion's surprise, Kinvara appears to be highly accommodating in supporting Tyrion's goals, as she firmly believes that Daenerys is The Prince That Was Promised. Varys is more skeptical, being suspicious of any practitioners of magic, and points out that Melisandre had already declared Stannis Baratheon to be the Prince, only for him to be defeated twice. Kinvara says that while the Lord of Light has a plan, the humans following him do occasionally make errors. She then unnerves Varys by revealing that she knows Varys was emasculated by a \"second-rate sorcerer\" and offers to repeat the words he heard in the flames, and identify who it was that spoke. Varys is uncharacteristically unsettled by this revelation. Kinvara then assures Tyrion that she will send the preachers and priests best suited to the task at hand.  On the Iron Islands As the Kingsmoot is held, Yara Greyjoy is the first to lay claim to the Salt Throne. Yara argues that raiding the mainland is not enough for their people, and that they need to use military force to teach the mainlanders a lesson. An Ironborn man challenges Yara's candidacy on the grounds that she is a woman and points out that her brother Theon Greyjoy has returned. Theon endorses his older sister and urges the gathering to do the same; stressing that she is a warrior, a reaver, and an Ironborn. Many shout for Yara to be their Queen.  Before they can crown Yara, Euron Greyjoy joins the gathering to lay claim to the Salt Throne. He openly mocks Theon for his military failures and emasculation before deriding Yara as a woman. Yara in turn accuses Euron of killing their King and her father Balon. To her surprise, Euron admits killing Balon but then defends his actions on the grounds that Balon was leading them to defeat in the North. When Euron states that his only regret is not killing Balon years earlier, he is met by resounding cheers from the crowd. Theon then counters that Euron had spent years gallivanting overseas while Yara was commanding Ironborn ships and men. Yara then suggests building a massive fleet to attack and make their mark on Westeros.  The Door 25 Euron Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands.  In response, Euron announces that he also supports expanding the Ironborn fleet. Revealing a trick up his sleeve, he then proposes to marry Daenerys Targaryen and then carry her army and dragons back to Westeros. The Ironborn support Euron's plan and declare him king. The Drowned Men priest Aeron Greyjoy then leads Euron down to the sea to be drowned and reborn, as is the custom. Knowing that Euron will kill them as soon as he is able, Yara, Theon, and many of their loyalists flee the Iron Islands during Euron's coronation, taking much of the Iron Fleet with them. After Euron revives himself, he is crowned by his brother Aeron. After learning that his niece and nephew have fled with their best ships, Euron calls on his followers to build their own ships so that he may pursue the pair and kill them.  Beyond the Wall The Three-Eyed Raven shows Bran a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in a lush green valley. His vision shows Leaf and other Children of the Forest talking amongst themselves, then looking eagerly at a captive bound to the tree. Leaf approaches and forces a Dragonglass dagger into the captive's chest. The captive screams, but does not die, instead becoming the first White Walker.  Bran immediately confronts Leaf about creating the White Walkers. Leaf explains that they were at war with the First Men and were desperate. Later, Bran is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the Weirwood tree. Bran wargs into the tree by himself and sees the army of the dead. He slowly walks through the army until he comes to a space occupied by four White Walkers, including the Night King.  As Bran becomes aware that the The Night King and the dead are now able to see him, the Night King grabs his arm. He breaks out of the vision with a scream waking the others.  The Three-Eyed Raven tells Bran, Meera and Hodor that the Night King is now able to locate Bran, who is now marked on his right forearm, and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the White Walkers and the wights out of the cave.  As a result, they must leave immediately and Bran must \"become\" the Three-Eyed Raven. Bran asks whether he is ready, and the Raven says \"No\" at which point Bran's eyes whiten as he enters another vision.  As Meera and Hodor are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible, indicating the arrival of the army of the dead outside of the cave.  The Night King and three White Walkers start marching towards the cave. The Children of the Forest try using magic projectiles to fend the Walkers off, but are overwhelmed. They light a fire around the entrance which prevents the wights from entering but the Walkers extinguish a pathway and walk through.  The wights end up climbing over the Weirwood and dropping through roots at the top of the cave. Meera desperately tries to get Bran out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened Hodor to carry Bran away to no avail. Using a dragonglass-tipped spear, Meera kills the first White Walker that enters, and fights alongside the remaining Children of the Forest to try to fend off the wights until Bran wakes up. Wights begin to swarm the cave, killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf, as Meera starts yelling at Bran to warg into Hodor.  In the vision, Bran is at Winterfell watching his father say goodbye to his own father, Rickard Stark, before being sent to the Vale as a ward. While still in the vision, Bran hears Meera's cries to warg into Hodor and the Three-Eyed Raven tells him to listen to her. Bran wargs into both the present-day Hodor in the cave and Wylis, the young version of Hodor in his vision.  Young hodor seizing hold the door Wylis seizing, as his words \"hold the door\" evolve into \"Hodor\".  The Hodor in the cave puts Bran's body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with Leaf and Meera, as Bran's direwolf Summer is killed attacking the wights. As the wights are closing in on them, Leaf sacrifices herself, using magic to cause a huge explosion, buying the other three enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel. While the Three-Eyed Raven and Bran are still sharing a vision, the Night King kills the Three-Eyed Raven, and his figure within Bran's vision blows away as ashes and rags.  With some difficulty Hodor pushes the door open and pulls Bran through, coming back to help Meera close the door just as the wights approach. Meera grabs Bran's sled and tells Hodor to bar the exit, shouting to \"Hold the door!\". Inside Bran's vision, Wylis notices Bran, who links the present Hodor to the past Wylis. Wylis begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self. As Meera continues to yell \"Hold the door!\" to present-day Hodor, within Bran's vision Wylis falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure. Eventually, \"hold the door\" slurs into \"Hodor,\" as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment Hodor lost the ability to say any other words, and his destiny was fixed.  Present-day Hodor braces himself against the door long enough for Meera to disappear into the snow with Bran's unconscious body on the sled. Inevitably, the wights break through parts of the wood and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed Hodor. With no possibility of escape for him, all that is shown at the end is young Wylis in the past seizing and crying out \"Hodor.\""], "review": ["\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Why 5/5 : Game of Thrones Season 6 Episode 5 (The Door) was easily the most emotionally powerful of the season so far, and probably the most intense I can remember since the burning of princess Shireen in Season 5.Note: I\u2019m reviewing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from the perspective of someone who has read all of George R.R. Martin\u2019s novels and watched the TV show till latest episode.[Spoilers for those who are yet to watch the episode]Here we go for full review:I never thought much about Hodor when reading the books, or really when watching the show. It wasn\u2019t until this season when, a few episodes back, we see in one of Bran\u2019s visions that Hodor was not always Hodor. That he could speak.Hodor. (Credit: HBO)That was curious. Until the end. And it makes me want to cry.Bran is lost in a vision, taken there by the Three Eyed Raven, taken back not to witness his father departing for the Vale, but to somehow commune with Willas, Hodor\u2019s past self, a great big boy who whose life would change forever for one purpose: To hold the door. To save Bran and Meera. To foil the intentions of the Night\u2019s King. This guy:The Night\u2019s King (Credit: HBO)In all six seasons of Game of Thrones I have never once felt truly surprised and moved at the same time.Many of the biggest and most terrible events\u2014Ned\u2019s beheading or the Red Wedding or the wickedness of Ramsay Snow\u2014were in the first five of George R.R. Martin\u2019s books. Diversions from the book were either welcome but not terribly important\u2014much of the streamlining in the show, for instance\u2014or infuriating and pointless, like the burning of Stannis\u2019s daughter.But this came as a huge surprise to me. Hodor isn\u2019t just a big dumb giant of a man, he\u2019s a hero. His whole entire life was fated for this one moment, for him to hold the door against an unspeakable evil, to save a boy and a girl. I have been moved. Truly moved and a little flabbergasted, to boot. The show has done something special tonight, something unexpected but not simply for shock and awe. This was touching and tragic and powerful. Hodor became a hero tonight. He sacrificed himself, and his entire life, for this brief moment.Hold the door.Hodor.Let\u2019s stay here in the frozen wastes beyond the Wall for a while. It\u2019s cold, but I feel warm from all the revelations.Meera. Credit: HBONorth of the Wall: Meera and the Children of the ForestNorth of the Wall had all the best bits in Sunday night\u2019s episode of Game of Thrones. Beyond the tragic revelations surrounding Hodor, we had two other important moments.The first dealt with the weird, branchy-looking folk we know as the Children of the Forest. These are the \u201celves\u201d of Game of Thrones. They lived in the land now known as Westeros long before the First Men arrived. And when the men arrived, conflict ensued. What we discover in tonight\u2019s episode is that the Children, in a misguided effort to beat back the tide of humankind, used dark magic to create a weapon: The White Walkers. We aren\u2019t given a very detailed explanation of how this worked or what came directly after. Suffice to say, like most weapons of tremendous power, the White Walkers were more than the Children of the Forest could handle. It\u2019s the story of Frankenstein\u2019s monster, or the nuclear bomb. The White Walkers became enemies of their creators, and in tonight\u2019s episode, they slaughter them. Maybe not all of them, but all that were there with Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven.The second big deal in the cave has to do with Meera Reed. At one point, one of the Children of the Forest grabs a spear and thrusts it into the long-haired White Walker. This WW plucks the spear out of his chest and kills the elf in almost the same movement. But then Meera picks up a spear and lobs it into the Walker\u2019s chest and the creature turns into ice and shatters, much like a slightly colder version of the Wicked Witch of the West.This seems important to me. Was this a spear tipped with Dragon Glass? (Obsidian.) Or is it specifically because it was Meera who threw the spear that matters? Like Jon Snow, she\u2019s killed a White Walker now. Is it really the weapon that matters, or is it the hand that wields it?Credit: HBOWe are going to talk spoilers/book spoilers/fan theories which I happen to support real quick:I\u2019ve never much cared for the theory that Meera Reed is, in fact, Jon Snow\u2019s twin. The idea is that Meera and Jon were both born to Lyanna Stark in the Tower of Joy when Ned finds them. He\u2019s there with Howland Reed, the only two survivors of the battle against Arthur Dayne and the King\u2019s Guard. Ned takes Jon back to Winterfell and claims him as his own. Howland takes Meera back with him to the swamps and claims her as his own. The two are never told they\u2019re brother and sister, or that they\u2019re the children of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.I always thought this was a bit of a stretch, and that while the R+L = J theory was obviously true, the R+L = J & M theory was far-fetched. But after tonight\u2019s episode, I think I may have to whistle a different tune. Let me know if you feel the same or if I\u2019m crazy or simply missed something.Castle Black:First let me say this: Sansa is so much more awesome than she used to be. Perhaps a bit too hot-headed, but you can hardly blame her. She reminds me of a somewhat more determined Catelyn, without all the irrationality.We get a couple great Sansa scenes in \u201cThe Door.\u201d At least a couple weeks must have passed at this point. Not only has Littlefinger traveled all the way from the Vale to Mole\u2019s Town, Sansa\u2019s had time to make Jon a really excellent fur coat.In any case, Sansa meets with Littlefinger in Mole\u2019s Town and basically tells him that he\u2019s a lying sack of cow dung. She forces him to tell her what he thinks Ramsay did to her after she was abandoned with the Boltons. Baelish, for once, seems lost for words. He does, eventually, convey to her that her uncle, Brynden the Blackfish, has retaken Riverrun and marshaled an army. That\u2019s sort of an odd favor, though, since we can assume Littlefinger wants Jon and Sansa to use his army from the Vale. As always, his plots and plans are a bit inscrutable.Credit: HBOLater, Sansa lies to Jon and everyone else when they ask where she learned of the Blackfish\u2019s victories in the Riverlands. Later, Brienne asks her why she lied, and Sansa doesn\u2019t answer. I think it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want Jon to be tempted with the promise of an army from a man she no longer trusts. No doubt the offer would be tempting, since an army from the Vale\u2014the one kingdom untouched by war at this point, other than Dorne\u2014would tip the scales in their favor against the Boltons.But Sansa wants to play the game on her own terms, and her and Jon and Davos agree to go out and recruit as many of the Northern vassals as they can. I\u2019m glad they finally mentioned the Manderly\u2019s, too. Perhaps there\u2019s pie in the show\u2019s future after all.So Jon and Sansa set out, though Brienne is off to meet with the Blackfish. I\u2019m not sure I agree with sending her away. Podrick would have been a perfectly fine messenger. At least a retinue of sorts accompanies our heroes. The Red Lady, Podrick Payne, Davos Seaworth, Tormund Giantsbane (who is still making hilariously wonderful eyes at Brienne of Tarth. and I love it) They go to rally the North against Ramsay Bolton.They\u2019ll ride to White Harbor. Ramsay we are coming for you. Bastardbowl one step close\u2026The Iron Islands:Here Euron Greyjoy wins the Kingsmoot, much to the chagrin of his niece and nephew Yara and Theon. Euron is crazy, but he promises his people glory and riches. He tells them he\u2019ll go to Dany with a fleet and together with the Mother of Dragons they\u2019ll rule the world.So Yara and Theon escape while Euron is being drowned (yeah, in most places it\u2019s \u201ccrowned\u201d but they heard it wrong in the Iron Islands and so the rhyme stuck.) Not only do they escape, they take a bunch of ships with them. At least they had allies.Where will they sail? Like Dorne and various other regions, this is a fairly huge departure from the books.We\u2019ll fly to the other side of the continent and out across the narrow sea, for now. To\u2026Braavos:Here Arya Stark is still training, still getting the living daylights beat out of her by the older girl, still on track to become a Faceless Man (Girl?) (A girl has no face!)Finally, Arya\u2019s story went somewhere. Tasked with assassinating an actress, Arya is sent by Jaqen H\u2019ghar to a play. It\u2019s not just any play either. It\u2019s the story of King Robert\u2019s death, and the beheading of Eddard Stark.Credit: HBOI\u2019m not sure at this point what she\u2019ll end up becoming, but I\u2019m still betting against her going all the way Faceless. I said it in my predictions video and I\u2019ll say it again: Arya Stark is a Stark first and foremost. She can\u2019t forget or let go of the travesties visited upon her and her family.Vaes Dothrak:We won\u2019t linger long. Just long enough to watch as Jorah Mormont confesses both his love for Dany and his sickness, the Grey Scale. Perhaps the two are not so different for the aging knight. Both will kill him eventually.It\u2019s a touching moment, though nowhere near so powerful as Hodor\u2019s sacrifice later on. I\u2019m glad it came before that actually, as it would have been entirely overshadowed.Still, it was good to see Jorah speak plainly to his queen of his infatuation and devotion. It was good to see her forgive him at last. After all, he only agreed to spy on her before he knew her, before he loved her. Eventually he stopped. Everyone deserves redemption, and Jorah more than most.Dany told him, \u201cWell, I command you to find the cure, wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.\u201dSo Jorah goes on one very much impossible quest. Perhaps he meets his family up in the North will side with Jon and Sansa, too.Credit: HBOMeereenIn Meereen, Tyrion is still doing what he does best: Talking and drinking and knowing things. His plan, now that a tenuous peace has been achieved, is to get the propaganda machine\u2019s wheels spinning. So naturally he turns to the church.The High Priestess of the Lord of Light meets with Tyrion and Varys and agrees to help them, since Dany is obviously the Chosen One (just like Stannis, Varys points out; and just like Jon Snow, we think to ourselves.)Varys is, interestingly, pretty hostile about \u201cfanatics.\u201d He confronts the priestess about Stannis, mucking up Tyrion\u2019s diplomatic efforts with a pretty hostile challenge to the woman. Perhaps he takes issue with her desire to use the dragons to burn \u201cthousands\u201d of unbelievers. Tyrion does also, though only jokingly. Varys seems truly disturbed by the woman.He\u2019s more disturbed when he discovers that she knows his story, his deepest secrets, the tale of his loss of manhood at the hands of his master. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Varys so off his game and unsettled. I\u2019m not sure how to feel about it, to be honest. In the books, Varys isn\u2019t anywhere near Meereen, so I\u2019m still getting used to him being here.VerdictIt\u2019s interesting how certain parts of the show are so like the books while others are so different. I don\u2019t know what happens with Bran beyond the Wall.Then, in other areas the show seems so entirely and utterly divorced from Martin\u2019s work. Sansa in Castle Black? Varys in Meereen? Doran Martell in the grave? It\u2019s strange.Strange but okay. I like that the show and the books have diverged so vastly, because now I can still look forward to a different story in the books. I\u2019m actually hoping, however, that the Hodor story is the same in the books as it was on TV, because that moment was just so great.Hodor is one of the few characters on this show who got to exhibit unadulterated joy. He was never weighed down by politics, family drama and intrigue. No matter which characters or houses you happen to favor, everybody was on Team Hodor. Kudos to Kristian Nairn, who managed to turn a single-word performance into such a memorable character. He will be missed. Hodor. Hodor.. Hodor\u2026This was the best episode of Season 6 so far, and one of the best I\u2019ve seen of the entire show. Hodor has been utterly transformed for me, and we\u2019ve learned something big and important about the origin of the White Walkers. All told, a brilliant hour of television and I can\u2019t wait for next week. We have five episodes left. I wish we had ten.Update: source link.What did you think?Thanks for A2A Mohit Chawla.", "See, without Cersei and Jaime dragging it down with their boringness, I enjoy this show a lot more. Now if we can only cut out Dany, Jorah, Tyrion and Varys, we\u2019ll have a cracking show.This was probably the first episode in this series\u2019 history that I as a long time book fan literally stood up with my jaw dropped at what was happening on the screen. So many theories confirmed; so many other theories quashed in this episode. Previously bits from the show that hadn\u2019t featured in the books were either so obvious(Daenerys) or just not going to happen that way in the books(anything with Sansa or Brienne\u2026) But the Bran scene had me floored.A lot of scenes of people asserting good old fashioned dominance: Sansa dominates Littlefinger; The Waif dominates Arya; The Red Priestess dominates Varys; Euron Greyjoy dominates Yara and Theon; Bran dominates Hodor;The North\u2014some good solid soap opera going on between Sansa and Littlefinger. Littlefinger is still manipulating Sansa. People all over the internet are bitching about Sansa lying to Jon: these are the same people who bitch about her being so honest to everybody. I think holding her cards close to her chest is a good thing; and I\u2019m not so sure she should trust Littlefinger with his men. I mean, from her point of view. We saw what happened the last time Littlefinger offered to help someone(Ned.) But what confuses me, is why is Melisandre at that table? I mean, isn\u2019t Melisandre all about fighting the White Walkers? Isn\u2019t that her MAIN THING? And suddenly she\u2019s all just involved in the council meeting to take Winterfell? This show needs to think things through a little bit. I have a sour taste in my mouth about Brienne and Tormund Chocolate Stealer because my HILARIOUS post about him last week was flagged for being a joke answer, even though it wasn\u2019t really a joke, it was just funny. Lord Commander Edd Tollett. \u2018Don\u2019t Let the WAll Fall Down while I\u2019m gone.\u201d Jon says.Gee, I wonder what that was foreshadowing? Hamfisted Weiss and Benioff strike again.Braavos\u2014impressive as it is and despite the fact that it works cinematically, you have to wonder what the whole beat Arya training is good for? I understand it\u2019s some brainwashing technique, but it seems to be an end to itself. When Arya can\u2019t hit the Waif, she\u2019s failed: as if the whole thing is to hit the waif. By not hitting the waif, she proves that she\u2019s not \u2018one of them.\u2019 Yet, if she hit the waif, wouldn\u2019t that prove that the waif wasn\u2019t one of them? And anyway, what do all these quarterstaff shenanigans have to do with being a Faceless Man? How often are Faceless Men going to have to deal with people coming at them and fighting like that? It\u2019s like the show has combined water dancing of the books with, er, Faceless Manning. It\u2019s funny how the show boils thing down to sheer obviousness: Kill this innocent person or we\u2019ll kill you.But the play\u2026though the circumstances are slightly different, the play(based on a play from the Mercy chapter from the yet-to-be-released Winds of Winter\u2026I mean THIS is George RR Martin. You can really tell that this is the product of a great mind: the play is so multi-layered: it comments on nature of drama and it\u2019s distortion of events for the sake of story, as good king Joffrey is betrayed by the evil Tyrion and Stark\u2019s head is cut off; it works as history: medieval drama really was that silly; it works as we see the affect on poor Arya at the story being told and how it \u2018reminds\u2019 her of who she is\u2014so, so sad. And it\u2019s funny as hell. So when Arya says she\u2019s made her decision at the end, I think it\u2019s clear: she\u2019s out of there! On the other handd, was that Richardd E Grant as one of the actors? I can\u2019t imagine that he would have such a small role in this show: I assume he\u2019ll be back.Daenerys\u2014\u201dfind a cure and then come back. I\u2019ll need you in Westeros.\u201d Ah, see? This is just shit. I mean pure, unadulterated, unpasteurized, grade A, unfiltered, free-range, grass-fed, non-biodegradable nuclear SHIT. I can buy Dany walking unburnt through the fire. No problem. But Jorah just merrily riding off to cure an incurable disease? Puh-lease. Obviously, Benioff and Weiss screwed up by giving Greyscale to Jorah and now they have to backpedal furiously because \u2018they need him\u2019 with Dany for whatever the plot demands. Stupid.The Iron Islands\u2014Yara is, like, queen of the Game of Thrones montage, isn\u2019t she? I liked the King\u2019s Moot scene. Show Euron has all the spookiness and freakiness and madness shaved off him. Why is the show so afraid to get freaky? But it does what it does and I thought it worked well. Some other reviewer remarked about the whole kinslaying taboo having gone out the window. I could write alot about how the show boils everything down to life and death. I don\u2019t like it, but the show does, so I think that Euron\u2019s gleeful admission of murdering his brother and his wishes to murder Theon and Yara make sense within the confines of the show.I totally called that Theon would be taking Victarion\u2019s place. I didn\u2019t call Yara doing it.By the way, Theon\u2019s accent totally changed. That thick Yorkshire accent he\u2019s been doing\u2026it was mostly gone. I don\u2019t like that.Meereen: Speaking of stupid, I thought Tyrion was all-good, all-knowing? I can\u2019t think that his spreading the News of Daenerys\u2019 godhood is all that good idea. And the show hates religioun with a passion. So working with the Red Priestess is going to backfire. Nice face acting from Conleth Hill, seriously. I bought his horror and fear. But, where exactly is it going? Are the Red Priests going to screw things up for the fragile peace, or\u2026ooh, yeah. I forgot. I don\u2019t care.Bran: WOW. So this is what it\u2019s like for show-only watchers. A dozen fan-theories confirmed or destroyed in a few scenes.Children of the Forest made the White Walkers to defend themselves from humans!! Someone on reddit pointed out a throwaway line from A Storm of Swords: \u201cWas it really an Other you killed, Sam, or just a child\u2019s snow knight?\u201d Grrm strikes again!White Walkers/Others are NOT bothered by fire. Fire does NOT destroy them. Repeat Fire does not destroy them. Only the wights.Hodor. That \u2018hold the door\u2019 theory was always one of the funniest and most pointless bits of tinfoil I\u2019ve ever read. And yet\u2026apparently\u2026 Laughing my a off.No Tower of Joy revelation, but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re getting it.I have to wonder about Summer dying. Do you all think that it happens that way in the books? I tend to think Summer will survive that episode in the books, and they killed him off because of budget and shock value. But Hodor\u2019s death felt all too book-like, for me: effectively because Hodor gives his life for Bran, but because Bran wargs him and ruins his mind. There is no way that Benioff and Weiss came up with that idea: that\u2019s GRRM all the way.. And which way were they heading? North or South? I think something has to happen at the standing stones, which I think is where the White Walkers took the Craster\u2019s baby in Season 4, right?I don\u2019t know if it was just the spoiler power of the last scene or the lack of Jaime and Cersei\u2019s boring boringness or what, but I enjoyed this episode more than most.", "Pretty good.(Spoilers obviously. Pretty nasty ones. Go back if you haven\u2019t seen it already.)\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to remain when you are gone?\u201d - Bran, Dance with Dragons.Beyond the NorthWe finally have major answers. We know that the children of the forest, never always sung the song of the earth. They spoke the song of the dead for their own good. Their self-interests have finally lead to a full-stop of their tribe.The scene where Meera is waking up Bran is so similar to the prologue of Dance with Dragons, wherein Varamyr is being woken up violently by Thistle.We then have Meera feeling the cold and running out to witness the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Camera zooms in on the Night\u2019s King and then on to Meera:He sees me.It was established early on that ripples created by the present can be felt, and that now it can certainly have influence over the past. This truly doesn\u2019t sow any fruitful seeds, though. One such as that of Hodor. Isaac does a great job in projecting those emotions just by the use of his eyes. Works all the time. \u201cI told you so\u201d moments. Also, the tinfoils were partly right about Bran being a villain. The climax was a tragic poetry, poignantly constructed and delivered. Since this is coming straight from Martin, the show hasn\u2019t diverged on this bit. Thank god.Hodor\u2019s loss was truly fitting to the story. He has been Stark loyalist right from the birth. I think it is one of the very few advantages that the show medium enjoys: flashbacks. It\u2019s definitely visually stunning which perfectly enables them to explore Hodor\u2019s tragedy in his last, life-saving moments. I was more proud than sad somehow, as I always thought that when time comes Hodor must be sacrificed for good.Well \u201cThe Bear and the Maiden Fair\u201d tickling scenes are truly a gem. Bummer that our Maiden has to part ways. Sansa! That brings up the legendary Blackfish. The last we know of him was he escaped the red wedding and now he has an army!?There were other little moments I thoroughly enjoyed as well: Sansa\u2019s sisterly offering to Jon, Edd, Varys\u2019 past, and goodbye Jorah the Andal for good. I think Jorah\u2019s path will meet Euron or whosoever is going to eastwards to woo our Dragon lady.Kinvara. Kinvara. Ania Bukstein was meant to play this part. Her eyes ruined the spider\u2019s web. Wonder where the show writers are going with this? Is Quaithe coming back too this season?We are left to ponder over who\u2019s side we really want to be.The reason why obsidian can kill the WW because that\u2019s their core. They seem to be a lot powerful.The landscapes shots were carefully fitted with the character\u2019s depth. The colors in scene where Dany and the Co. have a chat were spot on too. This show gets a A for offering small moments and balancing the main story solidly.Hold the Door is possibly the new Always, possibly.Side Note: Coincidentally Jack Bender (Sopranos, Carniv\u00e0le, Under the Dome) earlier directed a movie called Rewind which is as the name suggest is based on time travel. The director clearly nailed the tragiheroic final moments of Hodor.", "Liked this episode thanks to a tense and brilliant ending. It washed away all the sins which show committed on Ironborn in this episode, which irked me despite the fact that I\u2019ve stopped comparing the show to books.****Obvious Spoilers follows****Talking about the top 3 exciting scenes/moments of the episode:Big reveal about the origins of Others. Children of the forest created something which in the end even they couldn\u2019t control, classic case of Frankenstein's monster. Bloodraven, children of forest, Summer (poor Summer), and Hodor (poor poor Hodor) sacrificed themselves in an intense climax to the episode when the Night King came calling for the Bran. Another highly unlikely and far out theory of \u201cHold the Door = Hodor\u201d came true, though partially, in an highly emotional end to the episode. Poor Hodor, he never had a choice in how his life was going to be shaped just so that he could hold the door years later. And note to D&D - STOP KILLING DIREWOLVES!!!!Sansa taking down Littlefinger. Her decision to make him say the deeds which Ramsay had done to her was chilling. Littlefinger had the decency to look ashamed, though for a master manipulator like him that would have come easy. I still maintain that the bastard knew everything about The Bastard and threw Sansa to the wolves (ironic pun). On the other hand, Sansa knitting Direwolf for herself and Jon was a cute momentWaif\u2019s punches - 10/10. Arya should plan on befriending her somehow and then when the time comes leave Braavos with her. Waif will definitely come handy in many a tight spots. A little reveal about the origins of First Faceless Man and how he brought the gift to slaves. Maybe in coming episode, show will give us the canon version of DoomContinuing a bit more on Arya scenes. The show did a interesting take in replacing Petyr with Tyrion in the play which was being enacted in the scene of betraying Ned. Not just replaced but shown in a highly negative light when after betraying Ned he forcefully married Sansa. Foreshadowing for a conflict between Arya and Tyrion?? Faceless men don\u2019t like dragons and they can give the contract to Arya to kill Tyrion who is helping Dany the mother of Dragons. Seems plausible.Sansa was shown in charge in scenes of planning their strategy against Boltons but there was also some naivety. She seems too trusting and banking on the \u201cNorth remembers\u201d. Given the harsh realities she has faced in past couple of years she should be skeptical of anything like this. Also how the armies in Riverrun will help them in North if she is not ready to take help from Petyr who is stationed at Moat Cailin.Now to talk about Kingsmoot. Even if I like to keep books out of my mind while watching show, somethings are just unacceptable. Kinslaying is the biggest crime and a Kinslayer is accursed in eyes of Gods and shunned by his fellow men. This is also true for Ironborn. This makes the decision of show to let Euron proudly accept that he killed his brother and King (adding Kingslaying to the list) strange and reduced Ironborn to lowly pirates who don\u2019t care about any of these things. I\u2019m not fan of Ironborn, but this stooped them down even more.Yara and Theon were smart enough to bail out from Kingsmoot as soon as possible with all the good ships that they can manage. Good on them, as Euron first item in his to-do list was to finish off his niece and nephew. And then the great leader Euron ordered his minions to \u201cchop down all trees and make me a fleet\u201d. Well they better make these ships in next couple of episodes if the Ironborn story is going to progress at all. Good luck ya poor \u2018xcuse of pirates!!!One perfunctory line mention for Vaes Dothrak - Dany is all teared up about poor Jorah the Andal and commands him to find a cure and come back.Moving on, in Meereen, another red priestess is in play now. Fanaticism and highly inflated ego is a very dangerous combination, so Kinvara + Dany can spell out bad news for everyone in near future. The stage seems set for Kinvara vs Melisandre (or Dany vs Jon). Good on Varys, though, to call out Kinvara on the questions that all the viewers were thinking.", "Oh, my word: it was fantastic!It makes it very hard to be flippant: the ending was extraordinary. Layers upon layers. The \u2018magic\u2019 stuff has been quite frustrating for me so far because (unlike the books) there seems no cost to it. This episode showed an incalculable cost: a person\u2019s mind.Previously, I was going toCompare the Night\u2019s King to Jack Frost, the naughty Goblin, from the popular book series for young children, Rainbow Magic. Not any more.Nor am I going to mention Bloodraven with his face like a disappointed iron.I take it back, Bloodraven: you were right to be a massive spoil-sport, with your \u2018we must leave this interesting flashback and return to the tree-cave, where we will be dank and bored for all eternity whilst mushrooms grow out of our faces.\u2019Bloodraven, you were right. Mushroom faces would be wonderful right now.Instead we had:-The Wall: Ding, dong! There\u2019s somebody at the door. If ever someone deserved hot pincers, it\u2019s Baelish.Braavos: Arya needs to kill the (possibly) Nice Lady because it\u2019s already been paid for. The corpse is presumably some kind of receipt and the potential \u2018cooling-off\u2019 period doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.Bran: Bran touches something he shouldn\u2019t. There were no warning signs around it and he probably has a claim: if a person can get compensation for a cup of coffee being hot, then the payout for entering a vision where the Night\u2019s King touches your arm, giving him access all areas to your tree cave in the future, should be astronomical.Iron Islands: Yara is looking odds on to be Queen until Euron rocks up to remind the Ironborn that he has a knob and she doesn\u2019t. He cannot resist a \u2018Theon hasn\u2019t got a knob\u2019 put-down, but how he knows that Theon hasn\u2019t got a knob is anyone\u2019s guess.Euron gets the job because he has a knob, though the Ironborn do noti) check he\u2019s got a knobii) recall that they also have knobs making them equally qualified, oriii) consider that it\u2019s not a great way to choose a leader.Vaes Dothrak: Dany commands Jorah to find a cure for greyscale and then return to her. Jorah goes off to do so. Daario looks at them both like they\u2019re stupid (which they are).Meereen: Tyrion decides to throw some religious fanaticism into the murder soup that is Meereen. If there\u2019s one thing guaranteed to cement a fragile peace, it\u2019s religious fanaticism (-not): Varys looks at Tyrion like Daario looked at Dumb and Dumber in the previous paragraph.The tree cave:I drew a diagram: I\u2019m not sure it helps.A bit like quantum mechanics, I kind of understood it at the time, but now I could no more explain it than I could resurrect Jon Snow. It is below.The last five minutes with Bran and Hodor were heartbreaking. The actor who plays Bran is extraordinary: he barely moves, and I couldn\u2019t even identify the expressions on his face, but it was all there and I felt it all with him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been left stunned like that by a film or a TV show.", "*SPOILER ALERT*This is not actually a review, this is just a theory stitched from the implications, spoilers and others fan theories which are already stated till season 6 episode 5.I am wondering what if all the spoilers and fan theories come true?1) Fan theory about Meera Reed being the long lost twin sister of Jon Snow.2) Fan theory about John riding an ice dragon.3) Also spoiler about Arya striking 3 names off her list this season.Sophie Turner turns up the HYPE (SPOILERS EVERYTHING)4) The implication from \"The Door\" episode that the White Walkers can now break the wall if Bran crosses the wall with the Knight King's mark on his hand.5) The show makers announced that this season is about Homecoming.So these combine to form this final theory:Bran reaches Castle Black with Meera (She should be alive for him to reach). Following Bran and his mark, the Knight's king marches to the wall with his army.Jon and Sansa will be in the Castle Black gathering the army to attack Boltons and take over Winterfell.If Arya strikes off 3 names off her list this season, I am guessing one of them should be Melisandre. She has to reach the Castle Black to kill her. So in the same time , she may reach Castle Black.If the theory about Meera being long lost twin sister of John is true, that makes her half-Strak and Winterfell is her home.So all Starks are united now. Jon, Bran, Sansa and Meera. They rescue Rickon together in Winterfell. Homecoming FTW.Now we have 4 people to ride the dragons (Daenerys, John, Tyrion and Meera) and 3 Dragons. It would be perfect if John wakes up the ice dragon trapped inside the wall. 4 Dragons and 4 people of that ambition can conquer anything. If this happens, there is no perfect time than this to be alive.PS: This is just a theory. There may be many loop holes in this. Comment if you find any. Everything has to fit in the timeline though.", "To be frank this episode somewhat turned to a time travel science fiction movie in the end.I still don\u2019t get why the 3 eyed raven took bran back in time to winterfell when he knew white walkers were coming for him. Did he do it just to make bran realize what turned Willis into HODOR? and what made willis cry \u201chold the door(hodor)\u201d when he is technically in the past at that time. Did bran warg into willis but then how hodor was under his control at the present or \u201cWarging doesn\u2019t follow rules of time\u201d.Ahhh!! Its confusing.It popped up lots of questions about bran\u2019s future and I know dozens of fan theories will arise until next week but still bran\u2019s character has taken a very deeper turn and he suddenly is gaining more and more importance as a character. Every one else starts to look petty infront of him.The demise of so many major characters in the same episode makes me sad. Children of the forest are technically all gone, 3 eyed raven gone, HODOR gone :\u2019( , Summer gone :\u2019( :\u2019(. What\u2019s now left of Bran and company if only Bran and Meera.What did the 3 eyed raven meant when he said it\u2019s time for you to become me. This is the one thing that I am dying to watch in the further episodes.Overall the episode was good and confusing for the end bit,important characters died but well then its Game of thrones. Killing characters after making audience love them is its USP.", "(Show Spoilers) Despite the very unexpected explanation of the Others/White Walkers, I thought this was a good episode.Sansa: The episode begins with Sansa working on clothes, and receiving a message to go to Mole Town. The expected confrontation with Littlefinger was well done: Sansa makes it clear that she suffered at the hands of Ramsay. Yet Littlefinger still finds himself in control again, first with his insistence that he never knew what Ramsay was. (Do you believe him?) Then he asks to speak, giving him a chance to dominate the conversation by telling Sansa that the Blackfish has somehow taken back Riverrun. She has more allies in her war against the Boltons. Sansa does not share this information with Jon, sending a wary Brienne to negotiate terms in the South. Now we may have yet another reason for Jaime to go to Riverrun, and perhaps participate in the cause of the Starks, as I cannot see him defending Ramsay, who thankfully is a renegade against the Lannisters. This plot development makes the Battle of the Bastards into a larger Westeros cause.Jon Snow: Sansa gives him a direwolf outfit, so Jon has been presented with clothes and free to leave the Night\u2019s Watch to aide the Stark cause. (I couldn\u2019t resist the Harry Potter joke when I saw the scene.) We don\u2019t get much of Jon, but what we get is important, as he will be doing politics to gain support for his battle against Ramsay. I predict he will get House Mormont and House Cerwyn, with House Hornwood as undecided. Sansa made a good argument for the Karstarks returning to the Stark fold, which Davos dismissed. We heard \u201cthe North remembers\u201d a lot in this section, which may be the show\u2019s way of acknowledging the book\u2019s Northern conspiracy without developing it into the plot itself.Arya: A girl has been given a second chance. It is a hard test for Ayra, as she has to watch an outdoor play that ridicules her father\u2019s death and shows the grief of her sister. Will Ayra kill the actress that she has been ordered to assassinate? Will she remember who she is, and decide to go to Westeros to avenge her father\u2019s death? The show leaves us with these questions.Daenarys and Meereen: She left her superhero cape with the horses, so she is back as good old Dany, talking to Jorah and ordering him to heal himself from greyscale. After dispatching all the Khals of the Dothraki into the flames, I suppose it isn\u2019t too much to ask. It was a nice moment, and knowing Jorah, he will obey, and everyone with greyscale will start worshipping Daenarys Targaryen too. We also got another Red Priestess, who has sworn that Dany is the prince who is promised. Thank goodness for Varys\u2014he mentioned Stannis Baratheon and the \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d speech. This priestess knows something about Varys and his mutilation, so R\u2019hllor is clearly invested in every link. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder about R\u2019hllor: the god raised Jon from the dead through one priestess, while another one is on Team Daenarys. It made me think of how both teams pray to God to win the Superbowl. However, it is significant that R\u2019hllor is clearly a player in the affairs of Westeros, even though so few in Westeros believe in that god.Ironborn: Is it me or is show Euron unimpressive? Why would anyone choose him over Yara? But I live in a country that may nominate Donald Trump to run for president, so I have no right to judge the Ironborn. Theon kept his word, insisting that his sister should be the first Queen of the Ironborn, and Yara certainly did her best to convince them. Euron introduces the Daenarys connection, while he apologized for not killing Balon Greyjoy sooner. I think the story will still be good, as Yara and Theon have taken ships, while Euron (no eyepatch) has ordered everyone to build more. I don\u2019t know where Theon and Yara will go, but it won\u2019t be helpful to Euron, He will probably be going to Slaver\u2019s Bay.Bran,Hodor, and The White Walkers: I saved this for last, as this was the Hardhome battle for episode 5. We find out that the Children of The Forest created the White Walkers to defend themselves against \u201cMen\u201d. (Well, if we need to get technical, it would have been the First Men, and I bet they are sorry now, as they made peace with them. Was that First Man a Stark tied up against the tree?) Bran was marked by the Night King (again, this suggests that he is a Stark to me), and Bloodraven warns him that he will come to find him. We find out how Hodor got his name, plus we learn that visions do affect the past. Hodor means \u201chold the door\u201d, which Hodor does to save Bran while Bran in a vision is looking at the young Wylis who has a seizure precisely when the present Hodor is defending Bran against the army of the dead. It is heartbreaking. We also see more death to important characters. This episode shows that Bran must live at all costs, and the costs were high. The show is playing a risky game with the Stark direwolves, and I really need to think about why they are choosing this path.A lot of questions remain\u2014the fate of Hodor, the connections of the Red God, Littlefinger\u2019s game, the show\u2019s risky gamble with the direwolves, who will support Jon Snow, why did the White Walkers go rogue after the Children created them?. We shall see.", "Disclaimer: I am only going to talk of the elephant in the room. The rest of the episode was good but really nothing special in my humble opinion. Apart from you know what, the best takeaways I had from this episode were:1)So Jorah is going on a lone wolf sort of a quest. I think this is a fascinating turn of events and can take the character to much darker, Wolverine-sque territories. We should finally get to see the real Jorah.2)Arya\u2019s arc is unfortunately, still quite bland. Lets hope she gets to kill someone by the end of the season. And no, I don\u2019t think she is returning to Westeros anytime soon.3)From the Northern arc, the Brienne and Tormund moment was fantastic, the rest was just setup for Bastard bowl. I am having a premonition Littlefinger may pull off a major backstab by the end of the season.Now that that\u2019s over, lets talk of what\u2019s breaking the Internet right now, and more importnantly, what implications does it have for the entire ASoIaF fandom.OBVIOUS Spoilers follow:So, we finally get to know why Hodor is well, Hodor, one of the apparently trivial, yet nevertheless most intriguing mysteries plaguing us since S1. I won\u2019t waste time describing exactly how this happens, but here\u2019s what I believe are its repercussions.First of all, lets be clear about how time travel in GoT really works. As many others have already mentioned, its based on a causal loop model. I feel there are two necessary points regarding this:1)To answer another long standing fan query, yes, Bran can and does change the past. The limit of his abilities are not presently clear. E.g: We don\u2019t know if Bran can directly interact with the past, like whether Ned Stark can hear him when he calls out. What we do know, however, is that Bran can warg into anybody\u2019s past versions, and thus indirectly affect the timeline.2)The timeline we are watching is one that has already been tampered with by future Bran. E.g: Its not like say X-Men:Days of Future Past or Back to the Future where a character goes back in time and his actions there change the present. No, to give a Back to the Future analogy, we are watching the timeline after it has been modified by Marty, and it is slowly being revealed how the modification takes place.What this means of course, is that now we have to see the entire series in a different light. \u201cHodor\u201d will hardly be the only time Bran uses his abilities, and what this implies is that literally any of the major events so far may have been orchestrated by Bran.And I don\u2019t have it to spell it out from here. \u201cHold the Door\u201d doesn\u2019t hold the door, but unlocks one to a Pandora\u2019s Box of wild fan theories. GoT has finally let its rabid fandom off its leash. We now have a license to go ballistic with our imagination, and justify everything with Time Travel, the mother of all deus ex machinas.But rationally speaking, there are 3 possibilities I can think of which Bran influences:1)Jaime pushes Bran out the window: Arguably the event which started it all (it directly lead to Tyrion\u2019s capture which indirectly led to the War of the Five Kings). But more significantly, it set Bran on the path towards Bloodraven and becoming a Greenseer, which had and will have a far reaching impact on the overall plot. So its quite possible Bran time travelled, warged into Jaime, and pushed his past self out the window, to set this crucial chain of events into motion.On a side note if this is really true, Jaime goes from a morally ambiguous anti-hero to a genuinely decent guy who, for all his flaws, would never hurt a child. I don\u2019t think GRRM would go down this route, it makes Jaime, hands down, the coolest character in the entire series!2)Something to do with Benjen: Again I have a hunch Benjen\u2019s fate will be revealed by Bran later this season, and who knows, he might even be responsible for Benjen going underground for all this time. Though to what purpose is of course, anybody\u2019s guess.3)The Mad King:This is more tinfoil, but The Mad King also dies uttering the same words over and over \u201cBurn them all\u201d. The resemblance to Hodor seems uncanny. Bran might have warged into Aerys, or even killed Aerys by warging into Jaime, who knows, either way it will be cool as fuck.P.S: This episode also properly introduced a cult favourite from the books, Euron Greyjoy. And I must say I am largely disappointed. This character had the potential to be the next Khal Drogo, Oberyn Martell or Sandor Clegane. I don\u2019t know whether its the writing( which frankly seems a bit weak this season ) or the acting, but Euron clearly lacks the bite and a certain edge which made the likes of Oberyn or the Hound such fan favourites. Show Euron gives the impression of a pompous noble, who will get killed any moment now, rather than a badass player of the Game, which book Euron is. And I virtually rolled my eyes at the thought of show Euron seducing Daenerys, I found the portrayal that bad, but then again its only my opinion.Overall, one of GoT\u2019s better episodes, though I would say lacked in overall consistency, and the usually sharp writing of GoT. Still plenty of positives, and nicely sets up the rest of the season.", "Spoiler free review: Fuck you, D&D.Spoilers:The good:Sansa. While she\u2019s still making missteps, she\u2019s also learning who not to trust. Refusing Littlefinger\u2019s help is extremely smart. While in the short term, it does seem like the most sensible thing to do, she also knows well enough that Littlefinger\u2019s help will come at a price.While it\u2019s far less subtle in the books, the intrigue between the Lannisters and the Tyrells is starting to go somewhere. I hope Oleana Tyrell realises that something smells fishy with Cersi\u2019s story. It\u2019s going to be so much less interesting if she thinks everything is on the level.It looks like the Iron Islands story might be going somewhere.The bad:Arya\u2019s story. Arya gets the shit beat out of her, Jaquen asks her things, Arya gives the answers she thinks he wants. Wash, rinse, repeat. Are they actually training her or just beating her up and playing mind games? I\u2019m annoyed that I\u2019m unsure about whether this is bad writing, or if they are actually trying to hint that something\u2019s up with how Jaquen and the Waif are treating Arya.The fuck you:Sure, kill another direwolf. I guess they mean as much as oaths mean in this world (as opposed to GRR\u2019s world). Don\u2019t bother making it meaningful or anything. CGI is expensive afterall.Pulling a Buffy\u2019s mom with Hodor. Seriously, fuck you D&D. You did not have the skill to pull off whatever GRR planned there, and you damn well knew it. The way it\u2019s written, there\u2019s no reason for him to die except to get us to cry.Look, I\u2019m fine with characters I like dying. It makes for a good story and it\u2019s not out of place in this world. But seriously, Hodor died just because Bloodraven\u2026what? Didn\u2019t like him? Felt like shattering an innocent boy\u2019s mind before needlessly making him die? For the lulz?Because, if Bloodraven didn\u2019t feel the need to wander around in Winterfell past, Bran could have warged Hodor from the present and not hurt him. Oh, but then Hodor wouldn\u2019t be Hodor. Even better, then Bran could have told Wyllis, \u201cHey, pick me up, we need to go NOW!\u201d and off they would have ran.And maybe Hodor/Wyllis still died that day, but:a). It would have been his choice.b). At least he\u2019d have not lived most of his life with a severe mental impairment.If the argument is that Wyllis wouldn\u2019t have been the faithful companion Hodor was, how would Bloodraven have known? He\u2019s not omnicient. If he was, he\u2019d have given them a few hours warning that the White Walkers were on the way (he\u2019d have known, of course). Plus, really, Hodor/Wyllis the only one in Westeros who would have helped? Jojen has greendreams which sent him to Bran. He knew it was his job to get him to the Children of the Forest. There\u2019s really nobody that either Bran or the Reed\u2019s knew who could have leant a back?There were ways to make Hodor\u2019s death both inevitable and meaningful. What\u2019s wrong with Bran figuring out there\u2019s something wrong with Bloodraven\u2019s little trip to the past while the White Walkers are outside the cave? What if it\u2019s Bran\u2019s arguing with Bloodraven that makes him warging Hodor from the past inevitable? What if it was Hodor in the present that realised he needed to hold the door, and he sends the message to himself?And I guess you can warg someone from the past for a certain amount of time before you break their brain? It was quite awhile after Bran warged Hodor that Hodor was told to \u201chold the door\u201d.Pointless. D&D just wanted to steal GRR\u2019s thunder.", "Hackneyed\u2026but chock full of spoilers.Sansa is all grown up now. They even flew Baelish about 700 miles through the winter and raiders, etc, just so he could be told off by her. I guess he\u2019ll just sneak on down to Moat Caillin again to hang out with Jon Snow\u2019s mom. Or maybe she came up north too. It should be a pretty quick trip if you don\u2019t leave the highway and only have a toilet break every 3 hours. It\u2019s great, though, she\u2019s sassy, making clothes, and all the while Jon Snow is moping around the castle telling everyone, \u201cHey, don\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m not in charge any more,\u201d and not inviting the woman who resurrected him to his meetings. Thank goodness for Brienne and Tormund, who are the comic relief in Westeroi\u2019s version of \u2018Taming of the Shrew\u2019.Speaking of theater, I did enjoy the show they put on in Braavos. It was a very welcome break from the Rocky Training Montage. There were boobs and, finally, a penis. Yes, they are taking the fan input seriously now. Actually, the theater piece was quite good, but I have to say it expects a lot from the Braavosi audience\u2019s knowledge of the court politics in Westeros. I would have written it with far more errors and character mixups, unless, bear with me and my theories, Varys has a sideline as a bard. Evidence 1: He tells Tyrion that he was part of a mummers troupe. Evidence 2: Varys has terrific connections in Braavos and could totally produce the play. Evidence 3: the guy is always dressing up and acting out different characters, especially in the book. He knows talent when he sees it. He\u2019ll be having Briennea playing the Sansa and Sansa playing Cersei, just as soon as Arya\u2019s done chasing chickens around the yard and not bruising despite multiple blows to the head and \u2018gives the gift of the Faceless God\u2019 to the two current actresses.Many people are excited about the Hodor revelation. I was not. It felt lame and small. When I heard D&D talking about it after the show, and how flabbergasted they were when it was revealed, I was imagining their real reaction. \u201cReally? He holds a door and dies? Oh yeah, don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t change that. Couldn\u2019t top that.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why they\u2019ve basically killed off Bran and Meera, and had the super-cheesy grenade self-sacrifice trope, but with elves! They are that upset. With a dash out the back door from a cave in a hill in a mountain valley that was surrounded by wights and WW\u2019s in the middle of a snow storm (WW home field advantage terrain, not Bran\u2019s), dragging a sledge, it seems like there should be no chance of survival. Bran even has a spider-tracer on him. Should wrap that up 5 minutes into the next episode. There just wasn\u2019t time this week.Couldn\u2019t have the wights trying to break through the torch-lit door catch fire and burn the place to the ground with the wight army inside as a setback for the WW\u2019s, nor have Hodor escape and explain how he felt to Bran about the guy messing him up since he was a kid and warging into him when he wanted to see over everyone\u2019s head. And that\u2019s just simple stuff I was thinking as I watched it. Nope. The \u2018Hold the door\u2019 explanation was painful enough that D&D decided just to end this storyline and quickly deal with the \u2018Here, this is how the Others were made. OK. It\u2019s done now. We now have the three classic monsters (Vampires, golems, werewolves) + dragons. We simplified it and made the out-of-control golems also be vampires.\u2019 No need for more buildup. It really feels to me like they are tying up the lose ends as quickly as they can. I guess the dragons are sort of golems, being created by Dany, but they\u2019re also sort of werewolf.The scenes with Dany were more of the same for her. A lot of gazing down at people and acting important. I\u2019m not sure if the \u2018I order you to find a cure to your disease, you big lovable lug,\u2019 was meant to illustrate her naivete or just weak writing. I think the only people who managed to stop greyscale were Stannis\u2019s maester & co., and they\u2019re long gone. Regardless, here\u2019s a horse, you\u2019re in the Dothraki foothills far from anyone who won\u2019t just kill you for having greyscale. Good luck, old friend. OK, yes, the lamb people will cure him. They seem nice.So, what else? Ah-yes, the Iron Born. Many besides me have talked about the fickle crowd. I\u2019ll cheer for anyone\u2026when do we get to go reaving again! Arrr! Well, in a nod to the impatience to go reaving, they elect Euron the next king through a resoundingly loud \u2018Rhubarb!\u2019 and then a few stick around to watch the ceremony. Theon and Yara know better. They hang back and while everyone is distracted ask \u201cWho wants to go reaving?\u201d 3/4 of the Iron Born go with them, and the rest is history. How else could they steal all the boats? No way it was just their loyal retainers, otherwise they would have still had the loudest \u2018Rhubarb!\u2019. I did enjoy the deeply spiritual reawakening of Euron after his baptism. \u201cFirst things first, lets kill my niece and nephew!\u201dThe episode needed more Tyrion. It still had him, but that guy (Peter Dinklage and Tyrion) is great. He manages his lines really well, and does the character better than in the books. I loved the lines in the last couple of episodes, \u201cA wise man once said\u2026\u201d \u201cwho said that?\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I drink and I know things.\u201d He\u2019s practically breaking fourth wall with that. It\u2019s terrific. And do you know what it would be really great for\u2026writing plays with Varys! Evidence 4. I can see the two of them doing a fantastic version of \u2018Brush Up On Your Shakespeare\u2019, from \u201cKiss me Kate!\u201d, a comedy-musical about a production of \u2018Taming of the Shrew\u2019, a Shakespeare play that is almost entirely a play-within-a-play, see Christopher Sly. The number of layers on this is off-the charts.", "[This review contains BIG spoilers from the episode. Seriously, do not read a word until you\u2019ve seen it]\u2026\u2026\u2026Holy, Holy Hodor. What did we just witness? It\u2019s hard to objectively review \u201cThe Door\u201d because like every episode featuring the Night King, this one too ultimately knocks it out of the park. Its failings, of which there are many, simply fall away given the potently visceral reaction that the ending evokes.That being said, let\u2019s attempt to deconstruct everything that happened over the course of this momentous episode.Surefooted SansaSophie Turner is awesome this episode. Her scene with Baelish is powerful, and forces the audience (if not Baelish himself) to contemplate the very real cost of viewing people as property to be traded for personal gain. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Baelish knew Ramsay\u2019s true nature or not; Sansa has paid the price for his actions regardless and will never recover wholly.In a positive sign however, while Sansa is wiser to his act and understandably wary of accepting his help, she has also begun to understand how the game is played. She can see through Baelish\u2019s contrite act and keep him at arm\u2019s length but at the same time, use his offer to get herself a bigger army.Sansa is also increasingly asserting herself as the Stark in the North, and is doing so while keeping her cards close to her chest, trusting not even Jon with the full extent of her plans. The show is hinting at some forthcoming tension between the two (with Baelish alluding to Jon being her half brother and Brienne asking her why she lied) but I can\u2019t yet be sure whether this will materialize, or if it is simply a red herring.Off Broadway in BraavosThe arc with no name finally lived up to its billing, and served up some satisfying scenes. The skit was delectable on its own, hilariously showcasing the \u201ctruth\u201d that\u2019s being propagated through the seven kingdoms following Joffrey\u2019s demise. But its real purpose was to demonstrate just how difficult it is going to be for Arya to let go of the past, given the magnitude of injustice she\u2019s had to put up with.On a side note, despite the show\u2019s attempts at lionizing the Sand Snakes, it seems to be Arya\u2019s sparring partner who has quietly established herself as the frontrunner to succeed Brienne as the most awe-inspiring female fighter in Westeros.Missionaries in MeereenAs expected, Tyrion\u2019s expedient plan to contain the violence in Meereen has yielded good short-term results. However, he understands that buying peace isn\u2019t sufficient. If the people are to truly believe in Daenerys\u2019 cause, they have to think of her as a higher being. It is to promulgate her divinity that he recruits the new Red Priestess who promptly impresses even the skeptical Varys with the bag of tricks we\u2019ve seen only too often courtesy Melisandre. Of course, one can\u2019t help but be mistrustful of the priestess\u2019 youth and good looks, given what we now know about the red gem she wears around her neck.Dany maybe immune to fire, but loyalty still melts her heart. Hence, on learning that her guardian angel Jorah has contracted Greyscale, she comes down with a curious case of Graduation Goggles, and orders him to find a cure. I have never liked Jorah, and hope that this offers us at least half a season\u2019s break from him.Logic is drownedThe Iron Islands segment was perhaps the most poorly directed and logic-defying segment of Thrones in ages. Just how fickle is this mob? They change their kingly allegiance with the pace of someone swiping through a list of potential hookups on Tinder.First, they throw their weight behind Yara after a few rallying cries. Then, they\u2019re swayed towards Theon when someone reminds them that Yara ticks all boxes except the most important one \u2014 \u201chas a penis\u201d (and conveniently forget that neither does Theon). And just when it appears that Theon has led them yet again to believe in Yara, out comes Uncle Euron. Looking far from regal, Euron admits to regicide and promptly lays out his plan \u2014 offer Daenerys their ships and form a coalition, then rule the Seven Kingdoms after her dragons have taken care of the rest. Whatever happened to \u201cwe do not sow\u201d?Anyway, let\u2019s chalk up the fact that the crowd immediately embraced someone who had supposedly not even set foot in Pyke in the last several years to another case of Ironborn fickleness. Even then, Euron\u2019s entire claim rests on the fact that he\u2019s got a huge fleet of ships \u2014 something that he lets Theon and Yara run away with while he was busy being baptized! And what\u2019s his reaction to this? Build a new fleet!Thankfully, given the time it takes to presumably build battle-ready ships, it seems as though we\u2019re once again prematurely bidding farewell to the Iron Islanders for the season. It is worth noting however that despite the contrived manner in which the show has arrived at it, the alliance between Dany and the Iron Islanders is a natural-enough, mutually beneficial one. Although, given what we know of Daenerys, Euron is likely to end up with the short end of the stick.HBO presents InterstellarSandwiched awkwardly in between Arya and the Iron Islands segment was the huge revelation that the White Walkers were, in fact, created by the Children of the Forest to curb man\u2019s encroachment on their lands. This scene had the potential to be an amazing cliffhanger, and the show really goofed up with its execution here.But boom! From here on out, the episode was pure gold. Not learning from his antics in the pilot, Bran again lets curiosity get the better of him. It turns out that Ned appearing to hear him in a previous flashback was no coincidence, as the Night King not just senses Bran\u2019s presence but actually makes use of it to break past the protective shielding that had till this point been guarding the children and the Three Eyed Raven.I was starting to seriously question the Three Eyed Raven\u2019s priority when faced with an impending White Walker invasion, he takes Bran on yet another pensieve trip. But as it turns out, Bran wasn\u2019t there for sightseeing.In what was Thrones\u2019 most tragic and intricately plotted shock moment till date, time proves to be a closed loop. Bran\u2019s warging into Hodor and Meera\u2019s repeated commands to \u201chold the door\u201d condemn poor Wyllis of the past to a simple-minded life as Hodor, only for that life to ultimately end at the same moment in the present, as Hodor, in one final heroic act, holds the door long enough for Bran and Meera to escape to safety. Wyllis\u2019 helpless screams set against the heartrending soundtrack had me completely dumbstruck.Hodor\u2019s childlike innocence and the utter lack of control he had over his fate makes this the most saddening death on Thrones for me (Shireen ranks a close second), and I don\u2019t think the visceral effect of that final scene will diminish even after repeated viewings.Rest in peace, Hodor. The world will never see your kind again.", "Game of Thrones\u2019 \u201cThe Door\u201d advances the slowed events of the show by bringing into fruition a key turning point for one of our inactive protagonists.There is more setup than anything, but I thought this was a great look into Bran Stark, someone who was sidelined for the entirety of season 5 and more or less inactive for the rest of the show.SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD.The WallIn the past few episodes, one question has been irking my existence: what exactly is Petyr (Littlefinger) Baelish\u2019s end goal? The once calculated mastermind was whittled down to a sniveling brat in his scene with Sansa, as he pleads for her to take him back. It really makes me wonder, did the show botch his character by deviating from the books and jumping the gun with Sansa\u2019s plot or is he still scheming something? I guess we will have to wait to find out.Jon Snow faces the full enormity of his situation: facing the North AND the South. I really enjoyed the debate about the Northerners\u2019 loyalty, as it throws a wrench in the unpredictable outcome of Jon\u2019s plight. Who can he really trust? How can he meet force with force? Jon now enjoys plot armor immunity (ie. why he was brought back from the dead), but he still faces many obstacles in the long winter to come. I will revel at the Bastard Bowl, when Jon finally stops Ramsay cold. The North Fucking Remembers.BraavosA girl is still not ready\u2026 Arya\u2019s plot has dragged out for a while now, but at least we got to see a glimpse of her true character through the absurd re-staging of The Battle of the Five Kings. Her discomfort in watching her family\u2019s history be re-written really enforced the fact that she can never truly escape her identity, despite striving to be the cold-hearted killer she is not.PykeTo be perfectly honest, I wish the show had spent more time developing the characters in The Iron Islands rather than painting an extravagantly useless subplot in Dorne. The time that the creators spent circle jerking the Sand Snakes and ultimately killing off potentially more important members of the Martells could have been re-appropriated toward the established rotten family dynamic of the Ironborn.Yara (Asha) Greyjoy is one of the few female characters who is unrestricted by the patriarchy of Westeros, and faces an interesting struggle because diplomacy is not her strong suit. The events of the Kingsmoot simply moved too fast and viewers weren\u2019t allowed room to breathe. In any event, I am at least satisfied with the younger Greyjoys escape and am intrigued to see how the inner conflict will extend to the rest of Westeros.Vaes DothrakIn the episode of Game of Romance, hot popular teen Danaerys Targaryen wistfully leads on war-torn LORD OF THE FRIENDZONE Jorah Mormont into oblivion, by promising that \u201cyou will be by my side\u201d when she conquers Westeros High School. Hunk of junk Daario Naharis watches on.Tragedy.MeereenThe chemistry among the new priestess, Tyrion, and Varys? Weird. That\u2019s all I can really say.Beyond The WallIn a dark turn, Game of Thrones manages to top its sickening deaths of beloved characters by revealing the brutally tragic of Hodor. I was on the edge of my seat while watching this scene. The ice mark on Bran\u2019s hand. The fire bombs of the Children of the Forest. The uncomfortable intercut between the White Walker\u2019s invasion and Bran\u2019s quiet flashback of Winterfell.EXCEPT\u2026 IT\u2019S NOT JUST A FLASHBACK. In a few short moments, we learn that the Night King can SEE Bran. We learn that Bran can warg into Hodor while remaining immersed in his vision. But then\u2026 Bran is not ready. His unlearnt warging without the Three-Eyed Raven leaves him at an extremely vulnerable place. And suddenly, the flood gates are open.\u201cHold the door!\u201dThis piercing statement jolts through Bran, through years of history, and into past Hodor\u2019s mind. Bran, by warging into present Hodor while still immersed in his vision triggered a violent and heartbreaking stroke onto past Hodor.The strained mumbling of \u201chold the door\u201d morphs into the word \u201chodor\u201d, and the full weight of Hodor\u2019s doomed existence comes to light.Hodor spent his entire life serving Bran. He died to save Bran. Yet it was Bran that caused his disability in the first place? That\u2019s a dark, terrifying chain of events. It oddly feels personal to such a minor character in the show.Congratulations, Game of Thrones, you have once again wrenched the delicate longing of happiness from deep within my soul and stripped it of all humanity. I guess that means we\u2019re back!", "[SPOILERS FROM GoT SEASON 6 EPISODE 5. OBVIOUSLY.]Personally I thought that this was by far the best episode yet, not least because there were highs of excitement, comedy and perhaps most significantly sadness.To look at each segment individually:The WallThe Sansa scene was very powerful. Her enduring anguish and pain at the treatment she received at the hands of Ramsay was chillingly portrayed by Sophie Turner. It\u2019s encouraging that she\u2019s beginning to grow in confidence and strength every episode, as evoked here by the contrition she wrung from Baelish.Baelish is still a fascinatingly complex character and I still don\u2019t know quite what to make of him. We assume that he is an omniscient master of manipulation, but did he truly know how bad Ramsay was? I did get a sense of genuine horror and regret from him; Sansa is after all the only remaining connection to Catelyn, who he did seem to genuinely care for.Did I sense some awkward sexual tension between Sansa and Jon when she was giving him the cloak?Finally, it\u2019s good to see the political action is hotting up. Galvanised by Sansa, the Starks are well on the road to regaining Winterfell and recovering from their fall.BraavosThe fight was pretty standard. The play, however, was exceptional. I don\u2019t know if it was just me, but the Ned Stark character was laugh-out-loud funny, and the weak Joffrey character was also amusing. It also provided an intriguing insight into how news and gossip travels through the GoT universe, with Tyrion being framed as the evil mastermind behind the Lannister rise, and Cersei basically being relegated to \u201cundeveloped wife\u201d role.Basically though, the scene was about showing how Arya, quite aside from being \u201ca girl\u201d, remains very much Arya. The Faceless Men seem to be well aware of this, and it seems only a matter of time before she goes back to Westeros.MeerenI think the best thing about this scene was, having demonstrated last week the deep gulf between the pragmatism of Tyrion and Varys and the idealism of Missandei and Greyworm, we now see that Tyrion and Varys have their own distinctions. Tyrion is diplomatic and something of an opportunist, whilst Varys, as a result of his childhood trauma, is deeply mistrustful.The new Red Priest seems an interesting addition to the cast and seemed to possess some sort of magical or clairvoyant power. I notice that as the show progresses the prevalence of magic increases.Vaes DothrakAs a long-term fan of Jorah (I know I\u2019m in the minority), I found the (albeit short) reconciliation/parting scene deeply moving. I hope he does find a cure, and that he is with Dany until the end.The Iron IslandsFor those who complain about the apparent volatility of the islanders at the Kingsmoot, that is exactly what the Ironborn are like. Much like Sansa, I\u2019m greatly enjoying Theon\u2019s recrudescence of confidence and self-hood, and \u2019m glad him and Yara got away to hopefully play important roles in the battle to some.Euron was is even more manic, darkly funny and dangerous as in the books, and I love him. I hope there\u2019s much more to come. My only complaint is that there hasn\u2019t been more colouring in of the Iron Islands\u2019 (in the books) vivid cast and culture.Beyond the WallSo here we are. Bloodraven is dead, Hodor is dead, and we finally know how he became Hodor and how the White Walkers were created in a scene that quickly went from terror to pathos.Hodor\u2019s bravery, strength and life-long sacrifice to Bran was one of the most tragic and grief\u2014stricken moments in any of the series, and it\u2019s end was the perfect tribute to a great man.", "Bran is such an asshole!!! Aaarrrggghhh, I AM SO PISSED WITH THAT ANNOYING KID\u2026Who the fuck asked you to simultaneously warg into the present Hodor\u2019s mind and also be in the past event with the child Wylis present?!!Yes, we know that you are extremely powerful in your mind-magic, but please learn something from Spiderman - \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility\u201dYou have been nothing but an irritation.Because of you, Jojen died.Because of you, poor Summer died.Because of you, the Three-Eyed Raven died.Because of you, all the Children of the Forest died!Because of you, poor Wylis gets his mind fucked up.Because of you, HODOR dies!! This is unacceptable.Too many casualties, and what have you learnt till now!!?In your year-long classes, didn\u2019t you even come across Haggon\u2019s skinchanging abominations rule?? Please study harder.IT IS UNETHICAL TO WARG INTO A HUMAN\u2019S MIND!!Yet, you motherfuckin asshole, you dont stop warging into poor Hodor. On top of that, you take his present mind and make it interact itself with the past mind? How twisted are you!!?And what is up with your unnecessary curiousity? Who the fuck asked you to roam away into the far North? Who the fuck asked you to check out the Night King\u2019s Army? And who the fuck asked you to get touched by him!!? YOU RUINED EVERYTHING, FOR EVERYONE!!Now, we won\u2019t be shown the R+L=J revelation also anytime soon. You stupid idiotic Bran. I HATE YOU. I will never forgive you for what you have done to my beloved Hodor. Huh.Sansa and JonOh lord Sansa, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why the fuck didn\u2019t you tell Jon that you had a whole Vale Arryn\u2019s Army in your hands!!!? Who the fuck cares what Littlefinger did. HE HAS A HUGE ARMY!!You stupid Sansa.. For your own ego, you turned down an entire Army! Gosh. And on top of that, you had the balls to lie to Jon!!! YOU LIED TO JON!!? Huh.And I see what you did there. Giving Jon that cute overcoat, trying to cajole him, trying to emotionally use him, you conniving little bitch.Poor Jon is so overwhelmed by Family Love, that he didn\u2019t see through it. Bastard na, he was yearning for family for a long time. And this Sansa was just trying to butter him up, by giving hand-made clothes.Sansa trying to manipulate Jon by giving small small gifts is DISGUSTING. Jon, being so stupid and naive is more annoying. Huh.Tormund and BrienneI was rooting so much for the \u201cBri-mund\u201d relationship!! But, this stupid Sansa had to send her back to the Riverlands to gather the Tully Army and the Blackfish. She leaving Tormund would break my heart. :(I hate Sansa. Brienne atlast found someone who genuinely desires her, and now Sansa is sending her half the world away. Aaarrrggghh!!Other segments were fine. Children of the Forest creating the White Walkers brings the Tony Stark creating Ultron twist. Both Ultron and the NK go rogue. So, yeah, that\u2019s fine.I liked the Ironborn mentality. They say yes and vote to anyone who grants them more wishes. LOL. Much like Indian politics.One says, I shall grant you some land and respect.Other says, I shall bring dragons and conquer the world.Promises. Empty promises.Who will build 1000 ships now? LOL. Yet, you become the King!! This is why I don\u2019t like democracy in a medieval setting. :PWhen there is no wide-spread education or literacy, I feel a benevolent monarchy is the best type of political system.Anyways, I am so pissed off at this episode. It was beautiful. It was bitter. It evoked emotions.Overall, it was bitter-sweet.Asshole GRRM.", "This episode is all about the Night's king marking on Bran. The marking cancels the magic spells that keep the WW away.Let's talk about Benjen Stark AKA. Coldhands for a moment, he has been beyond the wall for a long time for unknown reasons and we know that benjen has many things in common with the WW, although we're not sure exactly what (some people were thinking he's kind of undead but not so dead ..), now that we understand the marking concept we can only draw the parallel with Benjen's cold hands and I think that it would be safe to assume from here that Benjen's coldhands are WW marks on his hands, which also gives a very good explanation of why he stayed beyond the wall and never crossed it back south, which as we said would cancel the wall's magic. He has possibly spent all this time escaping the WW and fooling them around, which could also explain why they have been roaming lately whith no apparent purpose.Now from the ending scene we see someone coming to rescue Bran and Meera and most people think it's Benjen Stark / Coldhands so a possibility here is that when Bran was marked Benjen felt it and learned where he was, then headed towards him to rescue him, he came a bit late but just in time though to save him and Meera.Now to cross the wall south, Benjen woud have to chopp both his hands off and Bran his right arm, they have now someone to help with that, Meera, (and by the way haven't you noticed that we never saw the bloodraven's hands? and that he too can't walk? yes you guessed it, the BloodRaven is possibly Bran himself, just an older \"him\"). I believe that some bloody hands chopping off will be going on anyway before they cross the wall south and join the night watch where Bronn is now lord commander and would direct them to Jon Snow who is getting ready for a battle to wich Bran could possibly contribute by warging into stuff (Jon's direwolf? maybe).This failsafe crossing will basically lock the WW for some time until maybe as some people have been theorizing that someone would blow the horn (Euron Greyjoy?) and bring the wall down, and we can only hope that the westerosi armies would be united, equipped (dragons, valyrian steel, dragonglass), and ready by that time to fight back, .. but that is a topic for another time.", "I\u2019m a bit late to this because this is the episode that made me decide that it\u2019s time to drop the show altogether. I\u2019m a bit too tired to even bother with it, but I\u2019ll do a quick writeup. I won\u2019t be writing one for the upcoming episode tonight.First things first, yes \u2014 the final scene involving time-traveling warging and them showing how Hodor turned into Hodor alongside his death scene\u2026was legitimately emotionally touching. I don\u2019t think that every single aspect of the show is bad, but\u2026.In the first scene of the episode, it was funny to see how they lampshaded how ridiculous it was for Littlefinger to give Sansa to the Boltons. Aidan Gillen and the writers confirmed that he didn\u2019t know. So it\u2019s just some honest mistake that he gives up what is perhaps his MOST VALUABLE asset? Ramsay had the Ironborn at Moat Cailin publically flayed. He wasn\u2019t aware of that? Littlefinger just looks dumbfounded, and obviously he would be \u2014 there\u2019s absolutely no conceivable excuse he could come up with! Also, I love how Sansa and Brienne don\u2019t point out his weird perpetual smirk while he\u2019s supposed to be groveling/apologetic.Meereen and Dany: Kinvara\u2019s interactions with Tyrion and Varys were interesting. I\u2019d be interested in seeing how Dany\u2019s (potential) relationship with the religion of R\u2019hllor plays out. I bet that\u2019s how Jorah cures his greyscale.Castle Black: Sansa apparently sees it fit to lie to Jon about meeting with Littlefinger and the reveal about the Vale\u2019s forces. I can understand not trusting Littlefinger, but\u2026why bother sending Brienne to the Riverlands? First of all, she shouldn\u2019t have even needed Littlefinger to reveal that the Blackfish took back Riverrun. If Varys is aware of Stannis\u2019 defeat all the way in Meereen, something like Riverrun being in Tully hands should be public knowledge. Also\u2026the Riverlands is flanked by hostiles on multiple fronts \u2014 the Westerlands, and other southern armies allied with the Iron Throne (the Reach being one of them). It should be obvious that the Tullies shouldn\u2019t be able to send anything substantial. Of course, Brienne still apparently has a Riverlands plot to get done, so she gets shoehorned into nonsense yet again!King\u2019s Landing: All of it was pretty interesting and refreshingly plausible. The High Sparrow is one of my favorite characters, because the fact that he\u2019s so capable at manipulation yet driven by absolute morality is such a neatly unique contrast. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he comes out on top over the Lannister-Tyrell alliance.Iron Islands: Oh boy\u2026..this is the reason I was still willing to give the show a second chance and watch Season 6. They blew it, and I regret even giving a second chance. I was really looking forward to seeing Euron Grejoy and the amazingly well-developed and non-generic culture/setting of the Iron Isles on screen. I wanted to see in showEuron a villain that would make Ramsay look like a yelping chihuahua barking for more scraps of dog show. There was a new chapter GRRM revealed at Balticon that revealed even more interesting things about Euron. I expected to see a charming, knowledgeable, daring, world-traveling pirate who has established a fearsome reputation all around the world and has treasures/magical artifacts and badass boasts to indicate it. Instead, all I saw was the Westerosi equivalent of a drunken country bumpkin who comes late to a Kingsmoot, takes Yara\u2019s victory away by making a few well-placed sexist/dick jokes, gets away with publicly revealing kinslaying and kingslaying by saying he should have done it years ago, and announces \u201cWhere are my nice and nephew? Let\u2019s go murder them!\u201d after he almost seems to get killed during his baptism-by-drowned-god. He then seems to be left behind with about a dozen supporters, looking at numerous ships which must be manned by hundreds, if not thousands of people who\u2026didn\u2019t support him? He then declares that every tree in the Iron Islands get cut down to build a 1000 ships. Obviously, this shouldn\u2019t be plausible, but we\u2019re supposed to just overlook it for the sake of appreciating the show.And there are too many glaring things I\u2019ve came across in this season which I have to overlook to appreciate the show, and I just can\u2019t do that! This is no longer the thought provoking, unique low fantasy series I fell in love with.", "See, without Cersei and Jaime dragging it down with their boringness, I enjoy this show a lot more. Now if we can only cut out Dany, Jorah, Tyrion and Varys, we\u2019ll have a cracking show.We are almost mid-way in discerning what each episode of Game of Thrones Season 6, would hold for us. Strong winds suggests that Game of Thrones Season 6 episode 5, would set a benchmark for what\u2019s to come in future episodes. We have managed to crack few plots to help us understand the intricacy of this episode.Game of Thrones Season 6 Episode 5 Prediction, Watch OnlineGame of Thrones Season 6 Episode 5 OnlineGame of Throne season 6 episode 5, will be big on White Walkers. If you missed out on any special effects from Season 5, then wait for season 6 to blow your mind. The White Walkers are back, back with a bang! And not only would this, Episode 5 GOT Season 6, be swarming with White walkers, but, you would see the army lead towards Castle Black killing all. A broken promise by the Nights watch to \u201cStay True\u201d, by killing their Lord Commander, breaking the spell that kept the very foundation of the Castle Black safe. One can only wish a major intervention to happen before the wall falls apart.Here\u2019s what possibly happens next on Game of Thrones Season 6 episode 5 watch online, remember how Jon Snow burnt Ygritte\u2019s body under Weirdwood tree. Same would happen to Jon\u2019s body, taken by Jon\u2019s friend Tormund Giantsbane and Eddison Tollett. And before Tormund or Edd could burn Jon\u2019s body, the Nights King turns up and touches Jon\u2019s forehead, awakening a blue eyed Jon Snow the \u201cWhite Walker\u201d.Also check : Watch Game of Thrones Season 6 Online Streaming FreeThere are many theories going around. One possible outcome of Game of Thrones season 6 episode 5, has been described above, alternately, if we look on the other side, there are strong chances that this episode would do a 360deg turn and we see Jon Snow resurrected by Melisandre making Jon the Lord of Lights, as the Azor Ahai reborn. Stannis being slain by Brienne of Tarth, makes Jon the potential candidate to bring down the White Walkers. Without Jon Snow there is no chance for Castle Black to survive with the army of White Walkers. Post this, we can be all set for Jon Snow with his Valyrian steel sword and Nights King with a major face off. Shudders!! Go Jon Go!!!Whichever way you go one, would see the fate of White Walkers and Jon Snow in this Game of Thrones Season 6 episode 5 online.On the side lines, we would also see what comes of Lady Caterlyn. We\u2019ve heard that Beric Dondarrion would be the one to give Catelyn Stark the kiss of life and making her come back as Lady Stoneheart. Vengeance for her children\u2019s and grandchilds death would be the main motto of Lady Stoneheart. Here we also see Lady Stoneheart take over the leadership of the Brotherhood without Banners, a group of outlaws.Also check : Personality quiz \u2013 What\u2019s Your Game Of Thrones House?The makers of Game of Thrones Season 6 don\u2019t want much of the highlights to be announced revolving around Lady Stoneheart. Alternately, this could just be rumours doing the rounds, while a strong and surprising plot is being built for the return of Lady Stoneheart. One just needs to wait and watch what comes of it.This was probably the first episode in this series\u2019 history that I as a long time book fan literally stood up with my jaw dropped at what was happening on the screen. So many theories confirmed; so many other theories quashed in this episode. Previously bits from the show that hadn\u2019t featured in the books were either so obvious(Daenerys) or just not going to happen that way in the books(anything with Sansa or Brienne\u2026) But the Bran scene had me floored.A lot of scenes of people asserting good old fashioned dominance: Sansa dominates Littlefinger; The Waif dominates Arya; The Red Priestess dominates Varys; Euron Greyjoy dominates Yara and Theon; Bran dominates Hodor;The North\u2014some good solid soap opera going on between Sansa and Littlefinger. Littlefinger is still manipulating Sansa. People all over the internet are bitching about Sansa lying to Jon: these are the same people who bitch about her being so honest to everybody. I think holding her cards close to her chest is a good thing; and I\u2019m not so sure she should trust Littlefinger with his men. I mean, from her point of view. We saw what happened the last time Littlefinger offered to help someone(Ned.) But what confuses me, is why is Melisandre at that table? I mean, isn\u2019t Melisandre all about fighting the White Walkers? Isn\u2019t that her MAIN THING? And suddenly she\u2019s all just involved in the council meeting to take Winterfell? This show needs to think things through a little bit. I have a sour taste in my mouth about Brienne and Tormund Chocolate Stealer because my HILARIOUS post about him last week was flagged for being a joke answer, even though it wasn\u2019t really a joke, it was just funny. Lord Commander Edd Tollett. \u2018Don\u2019t Let the WAll Fall Down while I\u2019m gone.\u201d Jon says.Gee, I wonder what that was foreshadowing? Hamfisted Weiss and Benioff strike again.Braavos\u2014impressive as it is and despite the fact that it works cinematically, you have to wonder what the whole beat Arya training is good for? I understand it\u2019s some brainwashing technique, but it seems to be an end to itself. When Arya can\u2019t hit the Waif, she\u2019s failed: as if the whole thing is to hit the waif. By not hitting the waif, she proves that she\u2019s not \u2018one of them.\u2019 Yet, if she hit the waif, wouldn\u2019t that prove that the waif wasn\u2019t one of them? And anyway, what do all these quarterstaff shenanigans have to do with being a Faceless Man? How often are Faceless Men going to have to deal with people coming at them and fighting like that? It\u2019s like the show has combined water dancing of the books with, er, Faceless Manning. It\u2019s funny how the show boils thing down to sheer obviousness: Kill this innocent person or we\u2019ll kill you.But the play\u2026though the circumstances are slightly different, the play(based on a play from the Mercy chapter from the yet-to-be-released Winds of Winter\u2026I mean THIS is George RR Martin. You can really tell that this is the product of a great mind: the play is so multi-layered: it comments on nature of drama and it\u2019s distortion of events for the sake of story, as good king Joffrey is betrayed by the evil Tyrion and Stark\u2019s head is cut off; it works as history: medieval drama really was that silly; it works as we see the affect on poor Arya at the story being told and how it \u2018reminds\u2019 her of who she is\u2014so, so sad. And it\u2019s funny as hell. So when Arya says she\u2019s made her decision at the end, I think it\u2019s clear: she\u2019s out of there! On the other handd, was that Richardd E Grant as one of the actors? I can\u2019t imagine that he would have such a small role in this show: I assume he\u2019ll be back.Daenerys\u2014\u201dfind a cure and then come back. I\u2019ll need you in Westeros.\u201d Ah, see? This is just shit. I mean pure, unadulterated, unpasteurized, grade A, unfiltered, free-range, grass-fed, non-biodegradable nuclear SHIT. I can buy Dany walking unburnt through the fire. No problem. But Jorah just merrily riding off to cure an incurable disease? Puh-lease. Obviously, Benioff and Weiss screwed up by giving Greyscale to Jorah and now they have to backpedal furiously because \u2018they need him\u2019 with Dany for whatever the plot demands. Stupid.The Iron Islands\u2014Yara is, like, queen of the Game of Thrones montage, isn\u2019t she? I liked the King\u2019s Moot scene. Show Euron has all the spookiness and freakiness and madness shaved off him. Why is the show so afraid to get freaky? But it does what it does and I thought it worked well. Some other reviewer remarked about the whole kinslaying taboo having gone out the window. I could write alot about how the show boils everything down to life and death. I don\u2019t like it, but the show does, so I think that Euron\u2019s gleeful admission of murdering his brother and his wishes to murder Theon and Yara make sense within the confines of the show.I totally called that Theon would be taking Victarion\u2019s place. I didn\u2019t call Yara doing it.By the way, Theon\u2019s accent totally changed. That thick Yorkshire accent he\u2019s been doing\u2026it was mostly gone. I don\u2019t like that.Meereen: Speaking of stupid, I thought Tyrion was all-good, all-knowing? I can\u2019t think that his spreading the News of Daenerys\u2019 godhood is all that good idea. And the show hates religioun with a passion. So working with the Red Priestess is going to backfire. Nice face acting from Conleth Hill, seriously. I bought his horror and fear. But, where exactly is it going? Are the Red Priests going to screw things up for the fragile peace, or\u2026ooh, yeah. I forgot. I don\u2019t care.Bran: WOW. So this is what it\u2019s like for show-only watchers. A dozen fan-theories confirmed or destroyed in a few scenes.Children of the Forest made the White Walkers to defend themselves from humans!! Someone on reddit pointed out a throwaway line from A Storm of Swords: \u201cWas it really an Other you killed, Sam, or just a child\u2019s snow knight?\u201d Grrm strikes again!White Walkers/Others are NOT bothered by fire. Fire does NOT destroy them. Repeat Fire does not destroy them. Only the wights.Hodor. That \u2018hold the door\u2019 theory was always one of the funniest and most pointless bits of tinfoil I\u2019ve ever read. And yet\u2026apparently\u2026 Laughing my a off.No Tower of Joy revelation, but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re getting it.I have to wonder about Summer dying. Do you all think that it happens that way in the books? I tend to think Summer will survive that episode in the books, and they killed him off because of budget and shock value. But Hodor\u2019s death felt all too book-like, for me: effectively because Hodor gives his life for Bran, but because Bran wargs him and ruins his mind. There is no way that Benioff and Weiss came up with that idea: that\u2019s GRRM all the way.. And which way were they heading? North or South? I think something has to happen at the standing stones, which I think is where the White Walkers took the Craster\u2019s baby in Season 4, right?I don\u2019t know if it was just the spoiler power of the last scene or the lack of Jaime and Cersei\u2019s boring boringness or what, but I enjoyed this episode more than most.", "Warning : **Spoilers ahead! ** Don\u2019t read if you haven\u2019t watched the episode....If you would ask me to review this episode, then I would definitely coin it as one of the best episodes of this season and possibly one of the finest of the entire series.The episode starts with the encounter of Sansa and LittleFinger. The evolution of Sansa Stark from a stubborn Stark child to this Strong and Confident lady fills me with awe. Sophie Turner has justified her character in every possible way and I have become a fan of hers in this season. Once again, LittleFinger has made us wonder that what is actually his master plan!Coming to Arya, fighting hard against the feelings exploding inside her when her father\u2019s death scene is re-enacted, she is trying her best to become no one! The Faceless Man storyline never fails to amaze me! Let\u2019s see what future has in store for Arya!The meeting scene of Jorah and Daenarys was quite emotional and sets Jorah on his quest to search for the cure while Daenarys leads the Dothrakis on her mission to rule the Seven Kingdoms. Once again, quite an emotional moment in this season.Heading over to Tyrion, this little man is probably a delight to witness in each episode. The perfect dialogue delivery, the witty lines, just can\u2019t get enough of him. Once again, he has shown us how helpful he can be to the queen. Lord Varys\u2019s reaction on learning about his past from the Red priestess was again a high point in this episode!Now, here comes the best part in the entire episode. This season, most people would agree that Bran scenes are the best. So much mystery, so many revelations. This season couldn\u2019t have been so astonishing had not Bran been a part of it. The secret behind Hodor\u2019s Hodor was revealed and it really gave me Goosebumps. Hats off to GRR Martin, the way he connected the dots and finally disclosed \u201cHold the door\u201d was an absolute genius! Though Hodor\u2019s death made me cry :/ Also, one more Direwolf gone. :( The entire White Walkers vs Children of Forest scenes were also greatly shot.Finally, the time has arrived that Bran would take the three eyed raven\u2019s place and all his powers will be revealed. However with nobody left to protect him, it\u2019s interesting to see how he will survive. The episode has made a great progress into the future storylines and finally all the loose pieces are falling into place. This was one hell of an episode and I can only say that the coming 5 episodes have too much to offer. Looking forward to an even more amazing season ahead. Definitely my favorite season so far! :)", "Well, this was sort of better than the previous four episodes of this season (a pretty low bar), and it actually had a plot, unlike most of the episodes this seasons \u2026 so yay? Also, it lacked Ramsay and the High Sparrow, two characters whom I want to stab whenever they show up on the screen \u2026 so double yay.On the other hand, most of what we did see on screen made no sense or was outrageously offensive (D&D\u2019s signature style, in other words). The whole Hodor/hold-the-door nonsense was an insult to viewers\u2019 intelligence (so of course, some viewers are lapping it up, because they\u2019d rather believe that this is all ~so complex and smart~ rather than being incredibly stupid).The Kingsmoot was terrible and utterly illogical, but I never expected it to be otherwise, so I wasn\u2019t really surprised. I don\u2019t care about the Ironborn even in the books, and I care even less on the show, so whatever.Sansa had a sort of good scene with Littlefinger, but it mainly served to highlight what an insansely stupid plot she had been thrust in last season. And also the whole thing about her suddenly not trusting Jon was yet another pointless ~twist~. Last week she\u2019s all aboard the Jon-train, but now, the moment Littlefinger reminds her that Jon is her half-brother (as if she didn\u2019t know that already), she suddenly doesn\u2019t trust him anymore. Argh!Arya\u2019s story was the one I liked the most - or at least the whole play scene was good (the backstory of the Faceless Men was pointlessly changed to be the opposite of what it is in the books, but that\u2019s par for the course for the show). Apart from that utterly random and gratuitous crotch shot, the play and the backstage scenes were a lot of fun. Also, they were in daylight, which is a rare commodity on this show.Tyrion and Dany did some things \u2026 I may have fallen asleep due to boredom in those scenes, so I\u2019m not sure.", "Spoilers\u201cHold the door!\u201d\u2026 Easily the highlight of the episode. So much death for so little gain. Bloodraven, the children, Summer, Hodor\u2026 What was the point of Bran\u2019s journey North? It felt like he had only begun summer school before the shit went sideways. What was the point, I keep asking. Why hire Max Von Snowden instead of the guy from season four, then kill him after ten minutes\u2019 screentime? Why kill a Direwolf I'm such a senseless fashion? Why kill the Children like they're unimportant? And Hodor, who I'm not much fascinated with, getting plagued in the past by being warged in the future\u2026 Holding the door. Really exciting, this one.Sansa has lied to Jon. That was the most important takeaway from their arc this episode. She lied about who gave her the info on Blackfish. I think that Blackfish will eventually tell her about Robb's will, disinheriting her and naming Jon a Stark, and his heir. This may bring back some friction between them. Or Baelish might use it to try that.Baelish knew exactly what he threw Sansa into, he's not an idiot. But he talked himself.out of getting killed by Brienne.Brienne will never trust Davos or Melisandre. But we knew that already.Yara was stunningly reliant on Theon. Not sure I liked that. In the books she was inches away from becoming Queen under her own steam. She swayed all the men there on her own. Theon standing up for his sister, for anyone actually. Is touching, but robbed Yara of the tide that should have been hers.Daenerys is now commanding people not to die. To get cured of an incurable disease. And she expects to be obeyed too. Wow.Tyrion invited a fanatic to turn Dany into a messiah. We know how that went with Stannis. Wonder how much worse Daenerys will be. Kinvara was able to get under Varys\u2019 skin. No easy task that.", "SpoilersSO MANY DEATHS. What is the point of having fantastic (plot lines) characters like Bloodraven, the children of the forest, Hodor and freaking hell NOT ANOTHER DIRE WOLF if all they're there to do is to serve one of the main characters for a little while and then die?  It feels like the show runners are running away with the plot and hurriedly cutting every loose thread they find. With a blunt, rusty scissors.Rant over.The other plot lines are going fairly well, Arya's , Sansa and Jon's (although I really want to know why Sansa doesn't trust Jon) I found the Children of the Forests' creation of the Walkers pretty surprising, considering they hunt with dragon glass, which made me think they were not on the Others' side. I suppose it should only make sense that if they knew how to create them they know how to defeat them.I wish Theon had given his speech before Yarra's. It made it look like Theon bagged her more votes than she did, herself. And she has more power than that. I loved the intercutting of scenes between the run away Greyjoys and the swearing in of Who-Ron. I mean, Euron.<Suddenly a wild Khaleesi-Jorah moment appears> and then Jorah disappears. OK then.Finally Tyrion addresses the elephant in the room. Ruling the kingdom after it is conquered. I'm not sure what to think of the new red priestess.After that, I don't want to talk about the remainder. I'm so confused as to whether I love it or hate it.", "For me, this was definitely the best episode of the season so far. Obviously, there\u2019ll be some spoilers ahead.The HSQ (holy shit quotient) was through the roof. Lots of reveals and WTF moments. While I\u2019ve heard several theories that the Children and the White Walkers are somehow connected, actually having it confirmed is pretty big. The Hodor origin story is also something I\u2019ve seen hypothesized (if only lately), but again actually seeing it on screen was heart-breaking and sad.But what really caught me by surprise was the army of White Walkers actually showing up at Bloodraven\u2019s cave this episode! We knew Bran was going to leave, but I certainly did not expect it this soon.I was sad to see Summer go - It seems like the direwolves are cut due to CGI costs, which kind of sucks.The other parts of the episode were less exciting, but I did like the play Arya attended. Nice that they adapted that part of the Mercy chapter for the show. Also, the Blackfish will be back. Yay!", "I speculated the role of Children of The Forest in the others army and surprisingly it was true so here is the link to that Ashutosh Vishwakarma's answer to How will Game of Thrones end? and Ashutosh Vishwakarma's answer to Could the children of the forest be evil? I still suspect COTF role in bringing humanity down with the help of Bran and that is why leaf was trying to protect him from the undead.", "I already wrote a synopsis to the episode, being emotionally charged at Hodor's fate. :( Please read it here if you wish -Sayoni GuhaThakurata's answer to [SPOILER] In HBO's synopsis for Game of Thrones season 6 episode 5 \u201cThe Door,\u201d it is stated that \u201cBran learns a great deal.\u201d What is it?", "Poor Hodor, stunning revelation and apparently told to HBO people by George Rr Martin himself.

(growling)  (whinnies)  (snarling)  (howling)  (whinnies)  Come with me, now.  (growling)  The dead don't rest.  (grunts)  (grunts)  (growling)  (horse whinnies)  It's so green.  Oh, yes.  Once you get south of the Riverlands,  very different sorts of trees start to take over.  Maple, elm, beech, poplar.  The odd willow.  And of course now that summer's over,  you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.  Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.  You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.  That's not any better being a nervous mute.  I didn't think I'd ever come back here  after my father made me renounce my title  and inheritance  and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't.  A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.  And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.  So you know what to tell them.  That Little Sam is your baby.  Yes, now that's very important.  If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild,  he'll take you in.  He'll get an education. He'll learn to read.  And you can help teach him. Huh?  What did you tell your family about me?  I told them I met you in the North.  Did you tell them how far north?  Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.  You didn't tell them where I'm really from?  You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?  The thing is  my father doesn't like wildlings.  He hoped I'd make a man of myself by \"killing some bloody wildlings,\"  so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.  I think we're here.  (birds chirping)  Sam.  (laughs) Oh, Sam.  Oh, hello, Mother.  I never thought I'd see you again.  - You look wonderful. - Oh. (groans)  Talla?  Gods, you're a woman now.  Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.  - He has yellow teeth-- - That's enough, Talla.  Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.  Oh, my.  You are lovely.  I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.  Oh, and this,  this is our son Samwell.  Hello, little one. (laughs)  It's me, your grandmother.  (laughs)  May I hold him?  Yes, of course.  Oh.  You have a curious mind, I can tell.  You'll be a scholar like your father.  Where is Father? And Dickon?  They're on a hunt.  They'll join us for dinner.  Come inside. Such a journey.  You must be exhausted.  Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel.  Oh, and a dress for dinner.  You can wear one of mine.  What's your color?  Midnight blue or silver?  Silver, maybe. Come.  You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.  (pigeons coo, wings flapping)  Is there no other way?  You're afraid for her?  Of course I'm afraid for her!  It just seems very dangerous.  She'll be protected the entire way.  The Faith Militant are very stern  with those who overstep their bounds.  And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.  I suspect the gods will predispose the common people  to gentleness on her behalf.  She's truly opened her heart to them.  She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.  And now she's devoted to the gods as well.  Would you like to see her?  (door opens)  Have they hurt you?  Have they mistreated you?  - No, Your Grace. - I've missed you.  More than you could know.  We'll be together again soon  and everything will be better than it was before.  Better how?  Soon the--  walk of atonement.  He says there's no other way.  Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?  Yes, a few times.  Have you?  Yes, I have.  He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?  (chuckles) You think I'm mad.  I sound mad.  No. No, you don't.  You-- you could never.  You're right, he's not.  He's a lot more--  He is.  There's something about him.  His way of looking at the world.  It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.  It's taken me a while.  He's helped me.  What are you talking about?  You're a good person. You've always been a good person.  - You're the best person I know. - (chuckles)  I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.  Ah, yes, I visited their hovels  and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.  I never gave them what they really needed, though.  I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.  All those stories I told myself about who I was  and why I did the things I did.  There were so many lies in those stories.  I don't understand.  It's all right. It really is.  It's such a relief to let go of those lies.  What about Loras?  I love my brother.  I will always love my brother.  His soul is pure and perfect.  His sins don't erase that purity,  they only obscure it.  He just needs to atone for them.  We all do.  Sooner or later, one way or another.  The gods have a plan for us all.  (footsteps)  It's hard to walk in this.  It's beautiful.  You're beautiful.  (sighs)  This venison, it's very tasty.  Is it from today's hunt?  Well, no.  We haven't been able to cure that one yet.  This is last week's.  Oh, of course. Sorry.  - Long journey. - (Dickon chuckles)  Brought it down from 70 yards.  One shot.  Oh, that's a fair distance.  So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?  Oh, yes. Yes.  A good amount.  North of the Wall,  you don't hunt, you don't eat.  Mm-hmm.  Mostly deer or is it elk as well?  Rabbits.  Sometimes squirrels.  I say \"we,\" it's my friend Jon mostly.  Sometimes Edd.  Oh, and Gilly.  She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well.  Um, huntress.  Melessa: I imagine it's common where you're from.  We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,  who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.  Talla: Your father taught you to hunt?  Our father would never teach us.  I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.  That's enough of that.  Samwell, would you care for more bread?  Oh, yes. Yes, please.  Thank you, Mother.  Not fat enough already?  I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.  - He wants me to-- - I read your letter.  You're to be a maester.  Yes.  And once I have my chain,  I'll return to Castle Black.  I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.  Something resembling a man at least.  You managed to stay soft and fat.  Your nose buried in books.  Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.  I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.  Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.  He can wield a sword.  He killed a Thenn.  He killed a white walker.  (laughs) There's no such thing.  I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.  He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.  He risked his own life to save mine more than once.  He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.  Your way down to Castle Black?  Where did he kill a white walker?  Where are you from?  How'd you come to meet my son?  The Night's Watch came to our keep.  - Where? - Gilly.  - North of the Wall. - North of the Wall?  You're a wildling.  The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries  and here I sit hosting one in my hall  thanks to my son.  See that sword?  It's called Heartsbane.  It's been in our family for 500 years.  It's Valyrian steel.  Only a handful of them left in the world.  It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.  To him.  He will never wield that sword.  If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,  it would be the end of this house.  I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you  and I made my peace with that.  Who else would have him?  But I overestimated him.  No.  It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.  This you getting back at me, boy?  Hmm? Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?  And you got what you were after, didn't you?  A bastard. A half-breed bastard.  Your invitation into our home.  Come, my dear. Talla.  I've lost my appetite.  He dishonors us.  You dishonor yourself.  Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her.  To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens.  The bastard will be raised here.  But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.  I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.  I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.  I'm not angry at you.  I'm angry that horrible people  can treat good people that way and get away with it.  When do you have to go?  First light.  (Little Sam fussing)  (crying)  Say good-bye to him for me.  You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.  He doesn't know what you are.  Good-bye, Gilly.  - Sam? - We're leaving.  - What? - Get your things.  I don't have any things.  - What are you doing? - We belong together.  All of us.  What about your mother and sister?  Oh, they'll understand.  Your sister's dress.  She won't mind.  Looks better on you anyway.  Sam.  That's your father's sword.  It's my family's sword.  (groans)  Sam.  Won't he come for it?  He can bloody well try.  - (music playing) - (crowd cheering)  The lion and the rose are one.  I thank the gods above.  And to you, my beauteous bride,  I pledge undying love.  All: Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.  I'll drink a toast to my new queen,  for there is no one fairer.  Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?  Drink long and deep, my noble king,  from this cup of sweet wine.  The last drink he shall ever take.  And vengeance shall be mine.  - (laughs) - (audience booing)  - (gagging) - (audience gasps)  Poison!  Murder!  I gasp. I-- I die.  - (Arya laughs) - (gagging)  I limp.  And it was he  - (audience gasps, boos) - that poisoned me.  My evil Uncle Imp.  (laughing)  - (audience booing) - (laughing)  Calm down, dear.  My firstborn son.  My golden lion  foully, falsely slain.  I pray you found a lasting peace  free from strife and pain.  Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.  Take my life instead.  For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.  Oh, woe.  Oh, grief.  (crying)  Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow.  All hope is lost.  All joy is gone.  And there is no tomorrow.  (applause)  What is that I hear and smell?  Someone I'll soon send to hell.  It's time to see if truth they told  who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.  - (groans) - (audience gasps)  You beast. You beast.  You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.  No worse child ever stained this land.  Curse the day I named you.  (groaning)  - (farts) - (laughing)  My greatest crime. Now I must flee.  Then sail across the Narrow Sea  to do unto you more treachery.  Don't fear winter. Fear me!  - (laughing) - (audience gasps)  (booing)  Izembaro: Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca,  Clarenzo.  - I give you Bobono. - (booing)  I give you Camello.  And last but not least,  sweet Lady Crane.  (cheering)  Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.  That crowd was shit.  Girl.  What are you doing back here?  Nothing.  I saw you the other day in the audience.  How many times have you seen this stupid play?  Three times.  Did you pay?  No.  I remember when the players came to my village.  I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.  Just like you.  Saw the painted faces, the costumes,  listened to the songs,  cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.  I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.  You're very good.  My final speech is shit.  But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be,  the writing's no good.  So change it.  It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.  How would you change it?  The queen loves her son more than anything.  And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye.  She wouldn't just cry.  She would be angry.  She would want to kill the person who did this to her.  What's your name?  Mercy.  You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.  Wonderful eyebrows.  Do you like pretending to be other people?  I have to go. My father's waiting for me.  Lady Crane, they loved you.  They were sweet. Or drunk.  Drunkenly sweet.  No laugh for Ned's death.  These people are worse than animals.  But they loved her. They all love her.  Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.  I do what I can with what I'm given.  With what you're given?  Well, I was thinking--  Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?  Full to the tits with ideas.  - I didn't mean-- - You have ideas, I have ideas,  he has ideas.  Why should my ideas have any more value than yours  simply because I've been doing this my whole life?  Who is anyone to judge my work?  This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.  You have no right to an opinion.  (gasps)  Careful of that one.  She wants you dead.  And?  As I expected.  A shame.  A girl had many gifts.  You promised me.  Don't let her suffer.  Company, halt!  My lord.  My lord.  My friends, the hour has come.  Madness has overtaken this city  and grasped in its claws my children.  But now we must drive it back  under the rocks whence it came.  Madness has had its day!  Captain: Forward, march!  Rich or poor, noble or common,  if we sin, we must atone.  Margaery of House Tyrell  came to us a sinner.  She stood before the gods  in the holy sept and lied.  She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.  She disgraced her house,  her king, and herself.  (crowd murmuring)  Captain: Company, halt!  Face front!  Turn!  High Sparrow: Lord Tyrell.  Ser Jaime.  Sorry to interrupt.  We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.  Give them to us and we'll be on our way.  I don't have the authority to give them to you.  And you don't have the authority to take them.  - (crowd murmuring) - That's right.  Hyah.  - Captain: Lock spears! - (soldiers grunt)  I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.  The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.  You've already insulted one great house.  It won't happen twice.  Every last sparrow will die  before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.  To die in the service of the gods  would please each and every one of us.  We yearn for it.  But there is no call for it today.  There will be no walk of atonement.  (crowd murmuring)  Captain: Order up.  Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins  by bringing another  into the true light of the Seven.  (crowd murmuring)  Together we announce  a new age of harmony.  A holy alliance  between the Crown and the Faith.  (crowd cheering)  Woman: Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!  The Crown and the Faith  are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.  Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.  (crowd cheering)  What's happening?  He's beaten us.  That's what's happening.  When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.  Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit  to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.  I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.  You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.  I have to answer to the gods.  Not when you're sitting in that chair.  The Crown's decision on this matter is final.  Will I be walking naked in the streets?  Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first  to teach me about the gods' mercy?  You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.  And you will continue to do so.  But not in this city.  You've lost it?  Black Walder: Yes, Father.  It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.  Presumably you still know where it is.  You didn't lose Riverrun.  You let the Blackfish take it from you.  He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.  You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.  You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.  Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him,  you couldn't find him.  That's what it means to lose something.  Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.  I don't think it's fair to blame us--  For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,  swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.  Not again. Riverrun is ours.  Take it back.  We don't have the men.  We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.  Black Walder: The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.  Lothar: The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us,  raiding our supply trains and camps.  Black Walder: Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.  If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.  They're laughing at us.  All across the Riverlands  right down to King's Landing,  they're laughing at us.  I hear it in my sleep!  I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.  And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.  Take that castle back.  He'll never yield, Father.  Oh, he'll yield.  You'll show him the knife you used  to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly,  and you'll show him the knife you used  to open his niece's throat.  And you'll remind him who it was  that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.  His nephew.  (chains rattling)  Cheer up, Lord Edmure.  You're going home.  I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.  Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own  because he's 400 years old.  Sent me with an army to the Riverlands  and a siege that could last months.  Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army  than in the sept dungeons.  I'm not going to the Riverlands.  (pouring)  What, then?  I'm going to give Bronn  the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen  and have him gather the best killers he knows.  I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head  and every other sparrow head I can find.  - You can't. - He has our son! He stole our son!  He's torn our family apart.  How should we treat people who tear us apart?  We should treat them without mercy and we will.  But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive.  And without you, this is all for nothing.  Stand at the head of our army where you belong,  where Father wanted you.  Show our men where their loyalties belong.  Show them what Lannisters are,  what we do to our enemies.  And take that stupid little castle back  because it's ours and because you can.  You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.  It will be a trial by combat.  I have the Mountain.  They've made us both stronger, all of them.  They have no idea how strong we are.  No idea what we're going to do to them.  We've always been together.  We'll always be together.  We're the only two people in the world.  Why did you help us?  The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.  The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.  Now he lives again.  (gasps)  When I last saw you, you were a boy.  A fearless boy.  Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.  Who are you?  Uncle Benjen.  The last letter Jon wrote me  said you had been lost beyond the Wall.  I led a ranging party deep into the North  to find white walkers.  They found us.  A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.  Left me there to die.  To turn.  The Children found me.  Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.  How?  The same way they made the walkers in the first place.  You saw it yourself.  Dragonglass.  A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.  You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.  I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.  You must learn to control it  before the Night King comes.  Drink.  One way or another,  he will find his way to the world of men.  When he does,  you will be there waiting for him.  And you will be ready.  - (horse whinnies) - (bird screeching)  (horse whinnies)  (shouts in Dothraki)  Daario: Everything all right?

So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.  And what then?  I take what is mine.  You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.  What was I made for?

Gilly meets Sam's family. Arya faces a difficult choice. Jaime faces off against the High Sparrow.  Summary Beyond the Wall Meera pulls Bran through the snow as he remains in vision-state, but she is clearly getting tired. Bran experiences a rush of visions: King Aerys shouting \"Burn them all!\"; the Red Wedding, his family, wights in Hardhome, wildfire, dragons, Jaime Lannister and the Iron Throne. Pursuing wights are also seen. Meera cannot go on any further and tries to wake Bran, who comes out of his visions to say \"They've found us.\" She can hear wights approaching through the trees. With no more energy left to pull Bran, and barely enough to draw her sword, she apologises to Bran for failing him, as the wights come into sight.  Just as all appears hopeless, a mysterious rider appears and attacks the wights with a sickle and a flaming flail. Once the wights in the immediate vicinity have been dealt with, he urges Meera and Bran to come with him because \"the dead don't rest,\" and they escape on horseback.  Later, when they have reached relative safety and the rider is preparing a meal, Meera asks why he helped them. The rider reveals he was sent by the Three-Eyed Raven who \"lives again\" - just as he says this Bran wakes up. The rider reveals himself as a disfigured Benjen Stark, Bran's uncle, and explains that he was stabbed in the gut by a White Walker's sword and left to die, but the Children of the Forest rescued him and stopped the magic that would have turned him into a Wight.  He explains that Bran must now be the Three-eyed Raven, and when the White Walkers come to the realms of men, Bran will be waiting for them.  At Horn Hill Gilly arriving sams home Gilly and Sam near his home.  Sam and Gilly approach Horn Hill, the seat of House Tarly. Sam warns Gilly that they must claim Little Sam is Sam's son, and that Gilly should hide the fact that she is a wildling, since his father abhors wildlings.  Sam introduces Gilly and Little Sam to his mother, Lady Melessa Tarly, and sister, Lady Talla Tarly. In spite of her rough appearance, both immediately notice Gilly's beauty, and Melessa is delighted to meet her first grandchild. Talla tries to tell Sam of her upcoming betrothal, but Melessa shushes her. Talla takes Gilly under her wing, offering her a dress and a spare bedroom.  That evening, they all have dinner along with Sam's father, Lord Randyll Tarly, and brother, Dickon Tarly. Sam reveals his plans to become a maester and eventually return to Castle Black. Randyll criticises Sam for his weight and mocks his attempt to claim hunting and fighting skills, both of which Sam admits can actually be attributed to Gilly and Jon Snow, respectively. Talla is delighted to hear that Gilly can hunt for herself, and suggests that Randyll should be more like Gilly's father, a suggestion which makes Sam and Gilly wince.  Blood of my blood House Tarly dinner A very awkward and uncomfortable dinner at Horn Hill.  Gilly, defending Sam from Randyll's verbal assault, mentions Sam's heroism on three different occasions in which Sam proved himself to be a greater warrior than Randyll will ever be. But in doing so, she inadvertently reveals her origins from North of the Wall. So Randyll doesn't seem to take in her point about Sam's qualities but instead only hears that she is a wildling.  Randyll reveals his prejudice towards wildlings and his contempt for Sam. Melessa, thoroughly angered by Randyll's behavior, declares that Sam isn't the one dishonoring House Tarly, Randyll is. She then storms out, taking Talla and Gilly with her. Randyll eventually agrees that Gilly and Little Sam can stay at Horn Hill; Gilly will work in the kitchens, and Little Sam will be acknowledged and raised as a bastard. However, this will be Sam's last night at Horn Hill, forever.  Sam later apologises to Gilly for not standing up to his father and that he will be leaving at first light. However, he shortly returns to her, declaring that he has changed his mind, and says that they need to stay together as they belong with each other, and that they are all leaving right now. On the way out he takes Heartsbane - the family's Valyrian Steel sword.  In King's Landing Margery and tommen blood of my blood Tommen and Margaery are reunited.  Tommen is speaking with the High Sparrow about Margaery's Walk of Atonement, and the High Sparrow offers to let him see her. Tommen enters Margaery's cell and is surprised to find her speaking positively about the High Sparrow and contritely about her past sins, including her vanity about being seen to help the poor and needy. He finds himself agreeing with her feelings towards the High Sparrow.  Later, Mace Tyrell leads an army through the streets of King's Landing to a waiting Jaime Lannister, before giving a rather pompous speech at which Jaime cringes. Together, they proceed to the Great Sept, outside which the High Sparrow, Septa Unella, the Faith Militant and a large crowd of city folk are preparing for Margaery's Walk of Atonement. The army arrives, along with Olenna Tyrell in a litter, as the High Sparrow is speaking, and Jaime demands he release Margaery and Loras, before they can \"be on their way.\"  Blood of My Blood 11 Jaime arrives with an army from House Tyrell to attempt and save the Queen and Loras.  The High Sparrow refuses and fends off Jaime's threats to kill all the Sparrows by saying each Sparrow yearns to die in the service of the Gods. After a tense few moments he proclaims it will not be necessary, as there will be no Walk of Atonement. Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the faith. To Jaime's astonishment the doors of the Sept open and King Tommen emerges, escorted by his own guards, and walks down the steps to join the High Sparrow and Margaery in a demonstration of unity between the crown and the faith. The crowd burst into cheers after Tommen's speech, demonstrating that the High Sparrow now has the support of both the crown and the smallfolk.  Baffled, Mace asks what is happening. Olenna replies in disgust that the High Sparrow has beaten them. At the same time, a furious Jaime seethes at the High Sparrow's triumphant expression.  Later, in the throne room, Tommen strips Jaime of his position in the Kingsguard because \"an attack on the faith is an attack on the crown,\" but reveals that Jaime will not have to face imprisonment or humiliation; he can continue to serve his King and the Lannisters, just not in King's Landing.  Cersei jaime blood of my blood Jaime and Cersei as close as ever.  Jaime later complains to Cersei that he has been ordered to help Walder Frey recapture Riverrun, but instead he intends to find Bronn and whatever killers Bronn can find, to march into the Great Sept and kill the High Sparrow. Cersei says that he should go to Riverrun and show everyone how easily a Lannister can take a castle, as to attack the High Sparrow and his fanatics would probably result in Jaime's death and destroy everything they are working for. She does not need Jaime to be in the city for her trial, it will be a trial by combat and she has the unbeatable Mountain. She reassures Jaime they will still defeat all their enemies, and they kiss.  In Braavos Blood of My Blood 05 Arya speaks to Lady Crane and ends up saving her life.  Arya is watching the second half of the mummers' performance of The Bloody Hand in which the caricature version of Tyrion poisons his nephew and murders his father. She displays amusement at the rendition of Joffrey's painful death, while the crowd watches mournfully. She then seems moved by Lady Crane's performance as Cersei. She notices Bianca (the actress playing Sansa) mouthing Lady Crane's lines, possibly reinforcing Arya's hunch that Bianca is behind the Faceless Men's order for Lady Crane's death.  As the play is finishing, she sneaks backstage and poisons Lady Crane's rum, hesitating before doing so. She is still backstage as the mummers come in, and Lady Crane recognises her as having been in the audience earlier. The two converse and Arya realises she has much in common with the actor. Arya suggests to Lady Crane that Cersei's final speech is out of character to the real Queen Mother \u2013 Cersei wouldn't be grief-stricken, she'd be outraged and out for vengeance. Impressed with Arya's insight, Lady Crane compliments her again and asks if she enjoys pretending to be someone else. Apparently uncomfortable at what she has done, or unsettled by the question, Arya makes an excuse that her father is waiting for her and she leaves.  Lady Crane argues with Izembaro about improving the script and just as she is about to drink her rum, Arya reappears and knocks it from her hand. She points at Bianca and warns Lady Crane that Bianca wants her dead before running out. Unknown to Arya, the Waif witnesses this exchange and reports back to Jaqen, asking for permission to kill Arya. Jaqen reluctantly agrees, contemplating it is a shame as Arya had many gifts, and allows the Waif to proceed \u2013 but she is not allowed to let Arya suffer.  Meanwhile, Arya retrieves Needle, apparently demonstrating she has forsaken her desire to become a Faceless Man and once more is embracing her destiny as Arya Stark. She hides in a small room, blows out her candle and waits in darkness for the retribution she knows is coming.  At the Twins At The Twins, Walder Frey receives word that Riverrun is lost, retaken by Brynden Tully. He is flabbergasted, blaming his sons for allowing the Blackfish to escape the Red Wedding. Despite having superior numbers, Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers inform their father that Houses Mallister and Blackwood have risen against House Frey and the Brotherhood Without Banners are rallying the smallfolk and raiding their supply lines and camps. Walder demands that the Tully stronghold be taken back, refusing to be humiliated for failing to hold a castle from rebels. He decides to use his trump card to force their surrender: Edmure Tully, held as a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding. Walder brings him into his hall and jokingly tells his son-in-law to cheer up as he is going home.  In the Dothraki Sea Dany blood of my blood Daario and Dany.  Daenerys Targaryen is riding with Daario Naharis and her newly acquired khalasar of 100,000. She asks Daario how long it will take to get back to Meereen and inquires how many ships would be needed to carry her army across the Narrow Sea. Daario replies that it will take a week to get back, and at least 1,000 ships to take her new khalasar across the sea. Pondering this, Daenerys tells the khalasar to halt as she rides on ahead on her white horse. After a while, Daario announces he will look for her, but is stopped by the distinctive shadow of a dragon passing overhead. After a moment, Drogon appears and slowly circles the khalasar before landing, revealing Daenerys on his back. Daenerys asks if the khalasar is willing to cross the Narrow Sea, defeat the armies of the Seven Kingdoms, and rip down the keeps of its lords, as Drogo had promised. When they shout their affirmation, Daenerys reminds them that every khal in history has selected three Bloodriders to ride at his side at the head of the khalasar. Daenerys, however, is not a khal and does not have to abide by their rules. Therefore, she declares the entire khalasar her bloodriders."], "review": ["Yet another fantastic episode this season, if not so quite traumatic as last week's.

Get it right to the top.  - Man #2: Steady. Steady. - (men shouting)  (hisses)  (chatter)  (chatter)  Up she goes.  Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?  Here you are, son.  - Oh, gentlemen, please. - Man #3: To my right.  And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving.  Come on, come on. (laughs)  (panting)  (theme music playing)   In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that.  How many men did it take to cut you down?  Just one.  Ooh.  He must have been some kind of monster.  He was a woman.  (laughs)  (clanging)  (chatter)  I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.  I'm used to it.  When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days.  The way you were stinking already  and you had bugs all over you  and bone was coming through right there.  (laughs)  I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed.  Oh, nearly shit myself.  I reckoned you were gonna die  by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't.  Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days,  but you didn't. What kept you going?  Hate.  No, there's a reason you're still here.  Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.  No, a reason.  Gods aren't done with you yet.  I've heard that before.  Man was talking about a different god, though.  Well, maybe he was right.  I don't know much about the gods.  You're in the wrong line of work.  Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches  who think they know the word of god or gods.  I don't. I don't even know their real names.  Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods.  Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.  Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing.  I don't know.  What matters, I believe,  is that there's something greater than us.  And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.  You didn't know me back in my time.  You don't know the things I've done.  I've heard stories.  If the gods are real  why haven't they punished me?  They have.  Your Grace.  What are we reading today?  The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.  Chapter three, verse 12.  Ah, \"As water rounds the stones, smoothing--\"  \"Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love  calm a man's brute nature.  A wife salves her husband's wounds,  a mother sings her son to sleep.\"  You learn quickly.  There are some who know every verse of the sacred text,  but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood  and savages who can't read at all  who understand the Father's wisdom.  For years I pretended  to love the poor, the afflicted.  I had pity for them, but I never loved them.  They disgusted me.  They are hard to love.  The poor disgust us because they are us,  shorn of our illusions.  They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes.  How'd we smell without perfume.  (sighs) Can I ask you about a personal matter?  Of course.  The king mentioned that since your reunion,  you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.  No.  You have a duty, Your Grace.  To your husband, your king, your country,  to the gods themselves.  It's just  the desires that once drove me no longer do.  Congress does not require desire  on the woman's part, only patience.  The king must have an heir  if we are to continue our good work.  Forgive me.  Sometimes the true path is hard to find.  Hard to find  and harder still to walk upon.  But you've made great progress.  I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.  My grandmother?  Yes.  The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman,  a strong woman,  and an unrepentant sinner.  You must teach her the new way  as she taught you the old.  Or I fear for her safety,  body and soul.  (birds chirping)  Olenna: Does it move or talk?  I want to speak with you alone.  Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.  Oh, this is madness!  You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.  All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about  - Grandmother. - until I tell them to stop.  If I tell them to stop.  - You could use a good bashing. - Grandmother, please.  What have they done to you?  You marched against the High Sparrow,  - against the Faith. - We marched for you.  The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't.  - They showed mercy. - And what about your brother?  What mercy did they show him?  Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent.  If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden.  He'll have to renounce his name and title  - Have you lost your mind? - and live his life as a penitent.  He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.  He can begin again.  As a mindless fanatic.  As a free man.  You will leave for Highgarden today.  There is no law that says you must stay here.  I am the queen.  It is my duty to serve my husband the king.  But you should leave, Grandmother.  Your place is at home.  I will never leave you. Never.  - You must. - (paper crinkles)  Go home.  Find comfort in prayer and good works.  The Mother watches over us all.  I'll see you soon, my dear.  Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.  Shall we pray?  Dim Dalba: We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,  when the time comes and we meant it,  but this isn't what we agreed to.  These aren't white walkers.  This isn't an army of the dead.  This isn't our fight.  Tormund: If it weren't for him, none of us would be here.  All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.  And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.  Remember Mance's camp?  It stretched all the way to the horizon.  And look at us now.  Look what's left of us.  And if we lose this, we're gone.  Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.  Be like we were never there at all.  We'll be the last of the free folk.  That's what'll happen to you if we lose.  The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,  they know you're here.  They know that more than half of you are women and children.  After they finish with me, they'll come for you.  You're right.  This isn't your fight.  You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me.  I shouldn't be asking you.  It's not the deal we made.  I need you with me if we're going to beat them,  and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.  The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk  when no other southerners would.  He died for us.  If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards.  And if that's what we are,  we deserve to be the last of the free folk.  (growls)  Snow.  Are you sure they'll come?  We're not clever like you southerners.  When we say we'll do something, we do it.  (exhales)  I heard you were leaving King's Landing.  That is hardly your concern.  Your grandson is still a prisoner.  You'll leave him rotting in a cell?  Loras rots in a cell because of you.  The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.  Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you  and your stupidity.  You're right.  I made a terrible mistake.  I carry it with me every single day.  Good.  I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.  And now we must fight them together.  We need each other.  I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.  At a certain age, it's hard to recall.  But the truly vile do stand out through the years.  Do you remember the way you smirked at me  when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?  I do. I'll never forget it.  You love your granddaughter.  I love my son.  It's the only truth I know.  We must defend them.  I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can  before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.  If you're half as bright as you think you are,  you'll find a way out of here, too.  Never.  I'll never leave my son.  What'll you do, then?  You have no support. Not anymore.  Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that.  The rest of your family have abandoned you.  The people despise you.  You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them.  You're going to kill them all by yourself?  You've lost, Cersei.  It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.  (horse whinnies)  Man: Pick the pace up.  Keep going.  Man #2: Keep it moving!  (horse whinnies)  Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.  Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.  Someone certainly does.  Oh, no. Not me.  I'm just an upjumped sellsword.  You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.  Aye, knights don't get paid.  You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.  That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.  I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long.  You can be the right hand I lost.  You promised me a lordship and a castle  and a highborn beauty for a wife.  And you'll get all three. A Lannister always--  Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.  - (chatter) - (horse whinnies)  (pigs grunting)  Lothar: Come out and fight us, Blackfish.  We have Lord Edmure.  Yield the castle or we'll hang him.  This is your last warning.  Yield the castle.  You think I won't do it, old man?  I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear.  And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward.  Yield the castle or I cut his throat.  Go on, then. Cut his throat.  Lothar, is it?  Ser Jaime.  We didn't know you were coming.  'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.  You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.  Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.  Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.  Whoa, whoa.  Walder.  Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.  Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.  Now let's say I threatened to hit you  unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking.  - What do you think I'd do? - I don't give a rat's--  I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle.  Have him bathed and fed.  Unless you'd like to take his place.  Apologies, Ser Jaime.  Do as he says.  The siege is now under my command.  The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts,  he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.  Bronn: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches.  Set pickets every hundred yards.  And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.  Those are our siege towers--  As I said, the siege is under my command.  If that's not to your liking, go home.  Get word to the Blackfish.  I want a parley.  A parley or a fight?  He's an old man.  You've got one hand.  My money's on the old boy.  (bird screeches)  (door opens)  Lady Mormont.  Welcome to Bear Island.  I remember when you were born, my lady.  You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.  It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.  I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty  or any other kind of beauty.  She was a great warrior, though.  She died fighting for your brother Robb.  I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.  He was also a great warrior and an honorable man.  I was his steward. In fact--  I think we've had enough small talk. Why are you here?  Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black  before he marched on Winterfell and was killed.  He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men.  - It said-- - I remember what it said.  Bear Island knows no king  but the King in the North whose name is Stark.  Robb is gone,  but House Stark is not.  And it needs your support now more than ever.  I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.  (whispering)  As far as I understand, you're a Snow  and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.  Or is she a Lannister?  I've heard conflicting reports.  I did what I had to do to survive, my lady.  But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.  If you say so. In any case,  you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.  Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady.  It is our duty to stop him.  Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.  What you have to understand, my lady, is that--  I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here.  So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?  If it please, my lady,  I understand how you feel.  I don't know you, Ser?  Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.  You needn't ask your maester about my house.  It's rather new.  All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.  How is it you understand how I feel?  You never thought you'd find yourself in your position.  Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age.  I never thought I'd be in my position.  I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler.  And now I find myself addressing the lady  of a great house in time of war.  But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war.  It's our war.  Go on, Ser Davos.  Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,  made that man his steward.  He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew  he had the courage to do what was right,  even if it meant giving his life.  Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood  that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.  It's between the living and the dead.  And make no mistake, my lady,  the dead are coming.  Is this true?  Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.  I fought them at Hardhome.  We both lost.  As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided.  And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.  You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand.  But there's no hiding from this.  We have to fight and we need to do it together.  (whispering)  House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years.  We will not break faith today.  Thank you, my lady.  How many fighting men can we expect?  (whispering)   - 62? - We are not a large house,  but we're a proud one.  And every man from Bear Island  fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.  If they're half as ferocious as their lady,  the Boltons are doomed.  (horse whinnies)  (crossbows click)  Kingslayer.  Blackfish.  I assume you're here  to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.  I don't see Sansa and Arya.  - I don't have them. - Pity.  Do you wish to resume your captivity?  Then why are you here?  You know why I'm here.  This castle belongs to House Frey.  You're trespassing.  In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or--  Or you'll kill Edmure?  My nephew's marked for death no matter what.  Hang him and be done with it.  It won't stop with Edmure.  You'll force me to storm the castle.  Hundreds will die.  Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.  If you can breach the walls.  We'll breach them and kill every last one of you.  But if you surrender,  I'll spare the lives of your men.  On my honor.  Your honor?  Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.  The war is over, ser.  Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?  As long as I'm standing, the war is not over.  This is my home.  I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.  So you can either attack  or try to starve us out.  We have enough provisions for two years.  Do you have two years, Kingslayer?  You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.  Why did you come treat with me?  Sieges are dull.  And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.  Well, now you have.  Aye, now I have.  I'm disappointed.  Glover: The answer is no.  - Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. - I've heard enough.  We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.  The Boltons helped us do it.  Now you want me to fight against them?  I could be skinned for even talking to you.  The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton--  Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?  House Mormont.  And?  We sent ravens to Houses Manderly--  I don't care about ravens.  You're asking me to join your army.  Who is fighting in this army?  The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.  (laughs)  Then the rumors are true.  I didn't dare believe them.  I received you out of respect for your father.  Now I would like you to leave.  House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home  to fight alongside wildlings.  - Lord Glover. - There's nothing else to say.  I would remind you that House Glover  is pledged to House Stark.  Sworn to answer when called upon.  Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries.  We wept when we heard of your father's death.  When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call  and hailed him King in the North.  And where was King Robb  when the ironborn attacked this castle?  When they threw my wife and children in prison  and brutalized and killed our subjects?  Taking up with a foreign whore.  Getting himself and those who followed him killed.  I served House Stark once,  but House Stark is dead.  (men shouting)  (birds screeching)  (chatter, laughter)  (laughing)  Why did we have to come here?  Some of us still like it.  Have a drink at least.  I don't want one.  (sighs) Don't go far, love.  - (giggles) - I'll find you in a bit.  - (squeals) - (laughs)  Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that.  Doesn't interest you anymore?  I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.  I'll never hurt you, little brother.  Don't you know that?  You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?  Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat.  He'll find us.  It's a great big world and we have fast ships.  Drink.  I don't want any.  I don't care what you want. Drink.  Drink it all.  You're ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years.  Some bad years?  But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog.  Drink the goddamn ale.  Now listen to me.  I need you.  The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender.  Can you find him for me?  Drink.  You escaped. You hear me?  You got away and you're never going back.  We'll get justice for you.  If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.  Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink.  Listen to me.  If you're so broken that there's no coming back,  take a knife and cut your wrists.  End it.  But if you're staying, Theon, I need you.  We're gonna sail to Meereen.  We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen.  And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.  Are you with me?  Are you really with me?  Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while,  I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.  (men shouting)  Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.  And that's a good thing?  He was the most experienced commander in Westeros.  He chose this place for a reason.  Those mountains are a natural fortification.  There's a stream down there for the horses.  We're not staying here long.  Another storm could hit any day.  Aye, the snows defeated Stannis  as much as the Boltons did.  We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.  2,000 wildlings,  200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins--  62 Mormonts.  It's not what we'd hoped for.  But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.  (men arguing)  For fuck's sake.  So he's your most trusted advisor now?  Because he secured 62 men from a 10-year-old?  Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you  and he served Stannis for years.  Stannis who lost the Blackwater,  who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?  It's not enough. We need more men.  There's no time.  If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord--  We fight with the army we have.  (arguing continues)  Friends, this is not worth fighting over!  Davos: This'll be it, now.  Right, now we don't need to be fighting--  - Who the fuck are you? - Hold on.  Man: Yeah, who the fuck are you?  (crow caws)  (caws)  (birds chirping)  Ray: I was a soldier once.  All my superiors thought I was brave.  I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight.  Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid.  That's all I was, a coward.  We followed orders no matter the orders.  Burn that village.  Fine, I'm your arsonist.  Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief.  Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us.  I'm your murderer.  I remember once a woman screaming at us,  calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut.  But we weren't animals.  Animals are true to their nature  and we had betrayed ours.  I cut that young boy's throat myself  as his mother screamed  and my friends held her back.  That night  I felt such shame.  Shame was so heavy on me,  I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.  All I could do was stare into that dark sky  and listen to that mother screaming her son's name.  I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.  Now, I know I can never bring that lad back.  All I can do with time I've got left  is bring a little goodness into the world.  That's all any of us can do, isn't it?  Never too late to stop robbing people,  to stop killing people.  Start helping people.  It's never too late to come back.  (horse whinnies)  And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.  It's not even about the gods. It's about you.  Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.  Seven save you, friends.  How can we help you?  What are you doing here?  Well, we're talking about life.  You?  Protecting the people.  Ray: Well, we thank you for your protection.  Who are you protecting us from?  (chuckles)  Do you have any horses?  No horses.  No gold. No steel.  Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.  I'm sure it is.  You're welcome to stay for supper,  but we have hungry mouths here.  Stay safe.  The night is dark and full of terrors.  \"Seven save you, friends.\"  I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?  They don't believe in your Seven.  They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.  Aye, well, all are welcome here.  Anyway, we got nothing for them.  Sure, you do. You've got food,  you've got steel even if you say you don't.  And you've got women.  What do you want to do? Fight them?  Kill them?  It'd be you against all of them.  I mean, these people don't know how to fight.  You do.  I'm done with fighting.  Even if it's to protect yourself?  Violence is a disease.  You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.  You don't cure it by dying, either.  You've done enough work for one day.  Come on up for some supper.  It's gonna be a cold night.  We'll need firewood.  I'll save you a bowl of stew.  Might even have some ale hidden away.  (chatter)  He's not a lying man.  He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.  I'm inclined to believe him.  I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.  You're Westerosi.  What do you care?  I want to book passage home.  (laughs) You? Can't afford it.  (coins jingle)  Where'd you steal this from?  Why do you care?  We leave in two days.

Jaime confronts a hero. Arya makes a plan. The North is reminded.  Summary In the Riverlands The Broken Man 21 Sandor works with the congregation.  Revealed to have survived his wounds from his battle with Brienne, Sandor Clegane lives with a band of villagers. Brother Ray, their leader, is a septon. He talks with Sandor, and recounts how he had saved Sandor's life after having mistaken him for a corpse. When Ray mentions Justice, Sandor remarks that if there was justice in the world, he should have been punished. Ray responds that perhaps he has been punished already.  At a gathering, a trio of men from the Brotherhood Without Banners arrives and attempts to extort the group, but upon finding out that the group has no worthwhile possessions, they leave. Sandor warns the septon that the Brotherhood will return, and that Ray should defend himself from them. He tells Sandor that \"Violence is a disease\u2014you don\u2019t cure it by spreading it to more people.\" Sandor replies that you don't cure it by dying either. Later, while he goes out to the forest to chop wood, he returns to find all of the villagers murdered and the septon hanged. Angered, Sandor picks up an axe and heads off.  In King's Landing Queen Margaery is studying the Seven-Pointed Star at the Sept when the High Sparrow enters and they discuss the passage she's been reading, which is about the Mother's love and mercy. Margaery notes that in the past she pretended to love the poor when in fact she only really pitied them. The High Sparrow asks her why she hasn't joined King Tommen in the marriage bed, and Margaery explains that the desires that once drove her no longer do so. The High Sparrow assures her that desire is not necessary. She has a duty to produce an heir. The High Sparrow then makes a thinly veiled threat against Margaery's grandmother, Olenna Tyrell, stating that while she is a remarkable woman, she is also an unrepentant sinner.  The Broken Man 05 Margaery bids farewell to her grandmother.  After Margaery returns to the Red Keep, Olenna meets with her under the supervision of Septa Unella. Olenna insults the septa until Margaery comes to Unella's defense. Olenna pulls Margaery into another room in an attempt to gain some privacy, but Unella simply follows them. Olenna threatens to have her guards come in, but Margaery again defends the septa. She states that Unella has been a true friend and teacher, to which Olenna asks with some horror what the Sparrows have done to her. Margaery replies that the gods could have punished Olenna and her allies for marching on the Great Sept, but instead they showed mercy. Olenna retorts that they marched on the Sept for Margaery and Loras' sake, and that Loras is still in prison. She then tries to convince Margaery to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. However, Margaery refuses, stating that her duty requires her to be at King Tommen's side.  Margaery instead pleads for Olenna to return to Highgarden instead. As she emphatically tells her grandmother to return home, Margaery secretly slips a piece of paper into Olenna's hand. In doing so, she seems to have successfully communicated to Olenna that she doesn't quite mean what she's been saying in front of Septa Unella, and Olenna's expression changes, realizing this. She plays along and agrees to acquiesce, then walks away.  As soon as she is clear of them, Olenna privately unfolds the piece of paper and finds that there is a rose drawn on it. She seems cheered by the silent message, as the use of the Tyrell sigil indicates that Margaery is merely tricking the Sparrows and that her true loyalty is still to House Tyrell. She also seems to understand that Margaery is urging her to leave for her own safety.  The Broken Man 01 Cersei confronts Olenna.  Cersei later confronts Olenna about her plans to leave, telling her to remain for the sake of Margaery and Loras, who is still imprisoned. Olenna retorts that the reason all of this is happening is because of Cersei, as she was the one who allowed the Faith Militant to reform and allowed them to arrest Loras and Margaery. Cersei admits that she made a mistake with the Sparrows, but insists that an alliance between the Lannisters and Tyrells is more important now than it ever was. Olenna refuses her, noting that Cersei has neither influence nor support anymore and is surrounded by enemies. She tells Cersei that she (Olenna) will be leaving the city as soon as possible, and that Cersei's utter defeat is her only consolation.  In the North Jon, Sansa, and Davos Seaworth begin searching for allies to retake Winterfell from Ramsay. First, with the help of Tormund and Wun Wun, they secure the allegiance of the Wildlings and their elders led by Dim Dalba, who are still indebted to Jon for saving them at Hardhome and are aware that Ramsay and his allies will wipe them out if they do nothing. When the meeting disperses, Jon asks Tormund if he's sure that the Free Folk will join him, and Tormund responds: We\u2019re not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it. Prior to traveling to Bear Island, Davos shows Jon and Sansa the letter sent by Lyanna Mormont rejecting Stannis Baratheon's plea for help.  Jon, Sansa, and Davos travel to Bear Island, where they meet with Lyanna, the ten-year old head of House Mormont. Sansa and Jon try to flatter her with small talk about her mother Maege and uncle Jeor Mormont. However, Lyanna is unimpressed and aggressively brushes them off, demanding to know their business in Bear Island. Lyanna initially rejects their request for help and stresses that House Stark is dead and that she needs her forces to garrison Bear Island. She also remarks that Jon and Sansa cannot be considered Starks since the former is a bastard and the latter has been married twice into enemy houses. Lyanna is initially unconcerned about the threat of Ramsay. Before Lyanna can dismiss them, Davos intervenes. After briefly discussing his background, Davos manages to convince the young Lady Mormont by warning her about the dangers the White Walkers pose to the living. She agrees to contribute 62 men, which is all she can manage, and promises that they each fight as well as ten men.  The Broken Man 03 Sansa and Jon try to recruit House Glover.  Later, Jon and Sansa travel to Deepwood Motte to secure the allegiance of House Glover. They receive a frosty reception from Robett Glover, who points out that the late King Robb failed to protect his home from the Ironborn. Despite his being one of the Starks' most loyal bannermen, Robb did not come to his aid when the Ironborn invaded Deepwood Motte, imprisoned his wife and children, and brutalized his subjects (unaware that this was Robb's intention, but he was persuaded otherwise by Roose Bolton). When Sansa tries to highlight the fact that the Glovers had pledged fealty to House Stark, Robett responds that he received them out of respect for their father Eddard Stark but warns them that they have outstayed their welcome.  In the end, Jon and Sansa are only able to recruit a small number of minor houses, only adding a few hundred extra soldiers to their army. Lady Lyanna and her men are seen among the Stark and Wildling forces. Davos deals with a brawl among the Wildlings. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Jon is adamant that they attack Winterfell as soon as possible before Ramsay rallies more forces and before the weather turns on them. Sansa disagrees, instead opting to try and recruit more houses. When Jon refuses to change his mind, Sansa begins writing a letter, later revealed to be sent by raven to Petyr Baelish, taking him up on the offer for troops she previously rejected.  At Riverrun The Broken Man 09 Jaime arrives for the siege.  Jaime and Bronn lead the Lannister army to the gates of Riverrun, where the Freys attempt to coerce the Blackfish into surrendering the castle by threatening to execute Edmure Tully. The Blackfish calls their bluff and refuses to surrender. Disgusted with the Freys' incompetence, Jaime takes charge of the siege and attempts to parley with the Blackfish, warning him that the Lannisters will show no mercy to the Tullys, but if he surrenders, the lives of his men will be spared. The Blackfish rejects the offer and warns Jaime that he has two years worth of food in his stronghold, and that while hundreds of his own men may die defending, thousands of Lannister troops will perish as well.  In Volantis Theon and Yara take the Iron Fleet to Volantis to hide and rest. Inside a brothel, Theon sits despondently as Yara and the others carouse with naked and semi-naked prostitutes. Yara repeatedly tells Theon to drink some ale and he repeatedly refuses.  Theon Greyjoy returns Theon Greyjoy returns.  Yara is persuading Theon to regain his former identity and self confidence, as she will need his assistance in getting justice and retaking the Iron Islands from their uncle Euron. When pressed, he says that if justice were served, he would be burnt for his crimes, so she responds, \u201cFuck justice then. Do it for revenge.\u201d Eventually she convinces him to put his guilt aside and help her because she needs him. He drinks some ale and begins to gain some composure.   She then reveals to Theon that she plans to take the Iron Fleet to Meereen and forge an alliance with Daenerys before Euron does. After the conversation, she goes to have sex with a female prostitute.   In Braavos The Broken Man 20 Arya is stabbed by the Waif.  Although we last saw Arya hiding in the dark with Needle in her hand, the scene opens with Arya walking openly through Braavos without Needle, with her hands behind her back. She approaches two Westerosi traders drinking at an outdoor table and negotiates passage to Westeros at dawn, through the use of large bags of money she shows them.  We next see Arya standing on a bridge admiring a view of the Titan of Braavos when an old woman approaches her and reveals herself to be the Waif, who repeatedly stabs her in the gut, twisting the knife as she does. Arya escapes by leaping over the handrail and into the River. She is left stumbling through the streets of Braavos, leaving a trail of blood droplets and visibly afraid."], "review": ["My review. :)Old Favourites Return And Uneasy Alliances Are Made In This Week's Fantastic Game Of Thrones - ED | The Youth Blog"]}, "58": {"id": "s06e08", "name": "No One", "script": "(theme music playing)   Lady Crane: My son.  My firstborn son.  My child king, hush.  Listen to the gods, for you they sing.  Fight no more, sweet child.  Your wars are won.  The wolves are buried  and the false stag done.  Shut your blue eyes, my love.  Let the crown fall.  The Father above beckons you to his hall.  In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more.  But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore  and my brother the Imp  who killed his own king.  Born amongst lions, our curse from within.  I will slay him, I swear.  With noose or with knife,  though it take me a fortnight,  a moon or my life.  (applause)  (cheering)  (music playing)  Bobono: What is that I hear and smell?  - (audience booing) - Someone I'll soon send to hell.  It's time to see if truth they told  who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.  Man: Get the wig!  Izembaro: You beast, you beast. You killed my wife.  And now you've taken your father's life.  No worse child ever stained this land.  I curse the day I named you. (groans)  (crowd cheers, laughs)  Bobono: My greatest crime!  (thudding)  (people laughing, chatting)  You're good at that.  Where did you learn?  I'm a jealous woman.  I've always liked bad men  and they've always liked me.  They'd come home wherever home was that night  stinking of some whore's perfume.  So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them.  And then I'd feel terrible,  so I'd patch them up.  I got good at patching them up.  And good at putting holes in them.  (chuckles) And that.  What happened to the actress?  The one who wanted you dead.  Bianca.  She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress  after what I did to her face.  (slurps)  Mmm.  I never did learn to cook.  But eat. Eat. You need it.  The company is moving on to Pentos soon.  You should come with us.  - I can't. - Why not?  Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.  And besides, we need a new actress.  I don't think I could remember all of the lines.  Come with us.  What's left for you here?  You wouldn't be safe.  Not while she's looking for me.  Who?  She doesn't have a name.  Where will you go?  Essos is east and Westeros is west.  But what's west of Westeros?  I don't know.  Nobody does.  That's where all the maps stop.  The edge of the world, maybe.  I'd like to see that.  (groans)  - What's that? - Milk of the poppy.  I don't want any.  Sleep is the only way you'll heal.  Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.  (men laughing)  (horse neighs)  Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.  I was a famous kisser.  You lads know how to kiss proper?  Course we do.  This is for masters, this technique.  - You're not ready. - I'm ready.  He says he's ready.  All right. Now, pay attention.  You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.  Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.  Very romantic.  Take your middle finger, yeah,  and you jam it right up her bunghole.  (laughing)  So fucking close!  Ah, it smells like pussy to me.  Look at him. You get hard, boy?  Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.  (laughing)  Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?

The city has come back to life.  - You made a pact with fanatics. - I did and it worked.  If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.  That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.  Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.  I'm going to miss you.  I know.  I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.  If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.  We need friends in Westeros.  And we need ships.  Most of all, we need our queen.  She'll come back. She has to.  My heart's been broken too many times already.  I'll walk the rest of the way myself.  I can't go off on a secret mission  in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.  Varys.  The most famous dwarf in the world.  (knocks)  Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant  have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.  Have been permitted?  That's rather a tortured way of putting it.  They demand to see you, Your Grace.  Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?  The king is aware of their presence?  He is, Your Grace.  He's currently in his chambers at prayer.  Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon  wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.  His Holiness the High Septon  is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.  Your Grace, this is not a request.  It is a request, Cousin Lancel.  You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.  The High Septon commands you.  Are you sure you want to refuse him?  He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.  He made no such promises.  If you refuse to come of your own free will--  Get out.  Move aside, ser.  (raspy breathing)  Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.  I choose violence.  (grunts)  (grunts)  (gasping)  (gasping)  Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.  (men shouting)  Looks like a siege, my lady.  You have a keen military mind, Pod.  My lady. My lady.  Who goes there?!  State your business!  My name is Brienne of Tarth.  Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him.  Tell him I have his sword.  (men shouting)  (grunting)  Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?  (coughing)  (laughs)  Podrick fucking Payne.  I thought you'd be dead by now.  Not yet.  (laughs)  - Are they in there? - Uh-huh.  You think they're fucking?  What?  No.  Why not? I'd fuck her.  You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?  - I'm her squire. - Oh.  (chuckles) Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.  And she'd fuck him, don't you think?  The way she looks at him.  The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.  I preferred working with the little brother on that account.  Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.  You must have shown it to her by now.  - She's training me to fight. - Is she?  Oh. - An hour in the morning, an hour at night.  Every day.  Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?  Well, that's a different sort of fighting.  Now, that's the truth, isn't it?  You want to learn that sort of fighting?  All right.  All right, let's start with your footwork.  Show me your stance.  Now listen to me, Pod.  See how your feet are about a yard apart?  Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.  'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.  Do it again. Come on, don't sulk.  Jaime: I never thought you'd find her.  I just assumed Sansa was dead.  Why would you assume that?  In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.  I don't think you know many girls like her.  Well, I'm proud of you.  I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark  against all odds.  Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.  The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder,  so there is that complication.  What the hell are you doing here?  I've come for the Blackfish.  You're welcome to have him.  Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons  and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.  With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?  The Tully army.  They're a bit occupied at the moment.  I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun  currently defended by the Tully rebels,  so you can see the conundrum.  The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?  Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.  As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.  Exactly.  We shouldn't argue about politics.  You're a knight, Ser Jaime.  I know there is honor in you.  - I've seen it myself. - I'm a Lannister.  Don't ask me to betray my own house.  I do no such thing.  Take Riverrun without bloodshed.  Ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact.  What do you propose?  Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce.  Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.  Why would he abandon his ancestral home?  Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.  Have you ever met the Blackfish?  - No. - He's even more stubborn than you are.  All right.  Try to talk some sense into the old goat.  He won't listen, but his men might.  Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.  I need your word.  If I persuade him to abandon the castle,  you'll grant a safe passage north.  You have my word.  You have until nightfall.  (sighs)  You gave it to me for a purpose.  I've achieved that purpose.  It's yours.  It will always be yours.  One last thing, Ser Jaime.  Yes, Lady Brienne?  Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender  and if you attack the castle,  honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.  Of course it does.  To fight you.  Let's hope it doesn't come to that.  Blackfish: I've said no three times already.  I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.  I haven't seen her since she was a child.  I don't know her signature. I don't know you.  And I will not surrender. Double the guards tonight.  The Kingslayer wants to try us.  I can feel it.  As I have said, my name is--  Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.  - Good man. - He always spoke highly of you.  And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.  If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat  on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool.  Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.  We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.  - He's not my friend. - No?  Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle?  Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?  Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark.  He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted.  He gave me this sword to protect her.  That is what I have done and I will continue to do  until the day I die.  (chuckles)  She's exactly like her mother.  I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.  You have more than she does.  She wants her home back. I understand that.  But this is my home.  And if Jaime Lannister wants it,  he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.  Find the maester.  We need to get a raven north to Sansa.  What should I write?  Tell her I failed.  (chatter)  There's to be a royal announcement?  There is.  Why wasn't I informed?  There is to be a royal announcement  in the throne room  at this very moment.  Where are you going?  To stand by my son.  Your place is in the gallery  with the other ladies of the court.  Pycelle: Your Grace  Tommen: Lords and ladies,  the Faith and the Crown  are the two pillars that hold up this world.  One collapses, so does the other.  The Father judges us all.  If you break his laws  you will be punished.  After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon,  we have determined that Loras Tyrell  and Cersei Lannister's trial  will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor  on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.  (crowd murmuring)  Furthermore, after much prayer  and reflection,  the Crown has decided that from this day forward,  trial by combat will be forbidden  throughout the Seven Kingdoms.  (crowd murmuring)  Tommen: The tradition is a brutish one,  a scheme devised by corrupt rulers  in order to avoid true judgment from the gods.  Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell  will stand trial before seven septons  as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.  Seven blessings to all.  Crowd: Seven blessings.  (doors open)  Your Grace  that old rumor you told me about.  My little birds investigated.  And?  Was it just a rumor or something more?  More.  Much more.  Missandei: You seem happy.  I am happy.  You should both be happy as well.  Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.  Now it's like a man reborn.  I will be happy when our queen returns.  Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?  Unsullied never drink.  - Why not? - Rules.  And who made these rules?  Your former masters?  Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human.  Have a drink with me.  And you? What's your excuse?  I have tried wine before.  It made me feel funny.  That's how you know it's working.  Here's to our queen.  Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.  To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,  Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.  - Long may she reign. - Long may she reign.  Tyrion: Do you like it?  Tastes like it has turned.  Yes, yes. Fermentation.  One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms  I'd like to have my own vineyard.  Make my own wine.  The Imp's Delight.  Only my close friends could drink it.  Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.  I do not know any jokes.  Grey Worm?  Right.  Three lords walk into a tavern--  a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.  They order ale,  but when the barkeep brings them over,  each of them finds a fly in his cup.  The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.  The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.  The Stark reaches into his cup,  pulls out the fly and shouts,  \"Spit it out, you wee shit.  Spit it out.\"  It's funnier in Westeros.  The Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.  Yes.  A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.  Not a true story, necessarily.  A story that's supposed to make you laugh ideally.  Not at the moment, perhaps.  Missandei, do you like the wine?  I do.  Tell a joke.  Two translators are on a sinking ship.  The first says,  \"Do you know how to swim?\"  The second says, \"No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.\"  Ah! (laughing)  That is the worst joke I ever heard.  You don't even know what a joke is.  I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?  You lied to us.  I make joke.  (laughing)  More jokes.  I once walked into a brothel  with a honeycomb and a jackass.  - The madam says-- - (bells ringing)  (Grey Worm shouting in Valyrian)  (bells continue ringing)  The Masters have come for their property.  (men shouting)  Lord Edmure.  I apologize for the way the Freys treated you.  A man of your birth deserves better.  You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothed from now on.  I have your word?  (scoffs)  Oh, good.  Good, that's--  that's a fine thing.  My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser.  Whatever game you're playing.  The Blackfish is an old man.  A good death is all he can hope for.  But you, you have a child now, I've heard.  A son you sired on your wedding night.  You're a potent man.  A son I've never met  born of a wife that I haven't seen  since our first night together.  You should be with them both.  I can arrange that, you realize?  Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.  A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride.  And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own.  Do you imagine yourself a decent person?  Is that it?  After you've massacred my family.  Kept me in a cell for years.  Stolen our lands.  I'll remind you that our houses are at war.  I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you,  but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.  Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.  Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation?  It's not.  You understand. On some level you understand  that you're an evil man.  I'll leave the judgments to the gods.  Well, that is convenient for you.  You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?  (chuckles)  Your square jaw,  your golden armor.  Tell me, I want to know.  I truly do.  How do you live with yourself?  All of us have to believe  that we're decent, don't we?  You have to sleep at night.  How do you tell yourself  that you're decent  after everything that you've done?  I was your sister's prisoner once.  She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.  (laughs)  Yeah.  She should have killed you.  Perhaps, but she didn't.  Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.  But I didn't hate her.  I admired her.  Far more than her husband or her son.  Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?  No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner.  You don't have a choice.  The love she had for her children,  I was a little awed by it.  Reminded me of my sister.  Oh. Oh, I see.  You're a madman.  I'm not here to trade insults.  - Your sister was a strong-- - Don't talk about Cat!  - I'll talk about whomever I want. - (grunts)  She loved her children.  I suppose all mothers do,  but Catelyn and Cersei,  there's a fierceness you don't often see.  They'd do anything to protect their babies.  Start a war.  Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies.  The things we do for love.  You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.  That's exactly why I came here.  I love Cersei.  You can laugh at that if you want.  You can sneer. Doesn't matter.  She needs me.  And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun.  I'll send for your baby boy.  And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult.  Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure.  Your son doesn't matter to me.  The people in the castle don't matter to me.  Only Cersei.  And if I have to slaughter every Tully  who ever lived to get back to her,  that's what I'll do.  Guard: Who goes there?  Edmure Tully,  son of Hoster Tully  and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.  I demand entry.  Don't let him in.  He's the Lord of Riverrun.  I have to obey his commands.  He's been their captive  ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.  Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding  would decide to let him come home?  Because it's a trap, you idiot.  Don't let him in.  He's my lord, my lord.  I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.  You're not obeying Edmure's commands.  You're obeying the fucking Kingslayer's commands.  Edmure: I demand entry.  My lord has given an order.  With a knife to his throat.  That is not a valid order.  Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed--  Man: Aye, ser.  I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.  You are not lord of this castle, my lord.  - Lower the drawbridge. - Man #2: Aye, ser!  Black Walder: If you're wrong,  we've just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.  Welcome home, my lord.  Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms.  Open the gates.  - My lord-- - Your lord has given a command.  (men shouting)  Man: Infantry, advance!  Find the Blackfish.  Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.  Find him.  Go on.  Come with us.  I've run before from the Red Wedding.  I'm not running again. This is my family home.  Your family is in the North. Come with us.  Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.  You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.  Guard: All the way down!  - Check that out! - Go on, now.  I haven't had a proper sword fight in years.  I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.  (men shouting)  We found the Blackfish, my lord.  Good.  Bring him to me.  He died fighting, my lord.  (men shouting)  - I was wrong. I admit it. - That changes nothing.  The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead.  If the slavers' forces--  No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.  And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying--  You're trying to tell me what the army should do.  You do not know what the army should do.  All right, what should the army do?  We'll not go to the beach.  If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid.  The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend.  - We stay here. - And then?  We wait for them to come to us.  Then we fight them.  (thudding, rattling)  (thumping)  (dragon screeches)  - (distant horse whinnies) - (men shouting)  Clegane.  What the fuck you doing here?  Chasing them. You?  Hanging them.  Any particular reason?  They're our men. Or they were.  They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers.  Why do you want them?  Same reason.  I was helping build it.  They killed a friend of mine.  You've got friends?  Not anymore. They're mine.  It's the Brotherhood's good name they've dragged through the dirt.  Fuck your name. They're mine.  I killed you once before, Dondarrion.  Happy to do it again.  Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.  Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.  You can have one of them.  Two.  No, no, no.  We're not butchers. We hang them.  Hanging?  All over in an instant.  Where's the punishment in that?  - They die. - We all bloody die.  Except this one here.  I'll only gut one of them.  Beric: No.  I'll chop off one hand.  We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss.  That's generous.  Bunch of nancies.  There was a time I would have killed all seven of you  just to gut these three.  You're getting old, Clegane.  He's not.  (gasping)  Please don't. I'll give you anything.  (choking)  (choking)  (choking continues)  Got anything to eat?  (distant horse whinnying)  Enjoying yourself?  I prefer chicken.  You ought to join us. We could use you.  I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.  Clegane, we're here for a reason.  The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason.  He gave a failed, drunk priest  the power to bring him back for a reason.  We are part of something larger than ourselves.  Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done  for something larger than ourselves.  Cold winds are rising in the North.  And you're going to go stop them?  We need good men to help us.  Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.  Beric: True enough.  But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me.  - Why? - (laughs)  I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric.  I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord  and I'm better than you now.  Aye, you're probably right.  You're a fighter.  You were born a fighter.  You walked away from the fight.  How did that go?  Good and bad, young and old,  the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike.  You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.  It's not too late for you.  (footsteps approach)  (groans)  - (thuds) - (gasping)  Lady Crane?  (winces)  Lady Crane?  If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly.  Instead  The Many-Faced God was promised a name.  He must always receive what is his.  You can't change that.  I can't change that.  No one can.  And now he's been promised another name.  (grunts)  - Hey! - Get out!  - Yah! - (grunts)  - (man coughs) - (gasps)  (chatter)  - (grunts) - (woman screams)  Hey!  - Yah! - (man shouts)  Ah!  (crowd shouts)  (groans)  (crowd clamoring)  Woman: My basket!  (panting)  (groaning)  (whimpering)  (panting)  It will all be over soon.  On your knees or on your feet?  (groans)  Haven't we been through this already?  That won't help you.  You told her to kill me.  Yes.  But here you are.  And there she is.  Finally a girl is no one.  A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell  and I'm going home.", "summary": ["Summary While Jaime weighs his options, Cersei answers a request. Tyrion's plans bear fruit. Arya faces a new test.  Plot In Braavos No one lady crane Lady Crane tends to an injured Arya.  The acting troupe are once again performing \"The Bloody Hand\" with Lady Crane, playing Cersei mourning the death of Joffrey. However, unlike the previous version, it is edited as Arya proposed, with Lady Crane's Cersei promising revenge. After the scene, Lady Crane walks off stage where she sees Arya, injured from the previous episode who seeks refuge with Lady Crane. Arya is then treated by Crane. They have a brief conversation about what they're going to do in the future (and remarking the fate of her rival actress, Bianca) with Lady Crane asking Arya to join the play company who is going to Pentos, and Arya warning Lady Crane about dangers that will be coming to both of them. Finally, Lady Crane tries to give Arya the milk of the poppy which Arya first rejects but accepts after being told that sleep is the only way for the wound to heal.  Arya No One fleeing An injured Arya fleeing from the Waif.  The following morning, Lady Crane is standing on a chair, fetching some medicine from a high shelf, when she sees a man in her room. Arya wakes up, startled by a crash. She finds Lady Crane brutally murdered, apparently impaled onto the legs of the chair she had been standing on. The man turns out to be the Waif, who rebukes Arya for not carrying out her mission so that Lady Crane could have died less violently, and now she has come to kill her. Arya leaps out the window and flees into the streets. She rolls under a wagon and flees into a bathhouse but is unable to outrun the Waif, who is closing in on her. Arya barely manages to stay ahead and rolls down a broad flight of stairs, overturning several baskets of vegetables in the process.  Waifs face no one ep The Waif's face in the Hall of Faces.  Her flight causes her wounds to reopen. Arya flees into an alleyway and uses her bloody hand to leave a bloody trail to a doorway, thus luring the Waif into a darkened room that is only lit by a candle. The Waif soon catches up with her. Closing the heavy door, the Waif tells Arya that she can choose to die on her knees or on her feet. Arya rises to her feet, retrieving her sword Needle from its hiding place under a blanket. With one quick slice of Needle, the candle is chopped in half and the room is plunged into total darkness.  Later, Jaqen H'ghar enters the Hall of Faces to find a trail of blood. He eventually finds that Arya has murdered and ripped off the Waif's face and stuck it into one of the shelves. Arya has also gouged out the Waif's eyes with her sword. Arya then confronts Jaqen who admits sending the Waif to kill her. He then tells Arya that she has finally become \"No One\" and has passed the test to join the Faceless Men. However, Arya corrects him that she is Arya Stark of Winterfell, and that she is going home. Jaqen responds with a nod and a barely perceptible smile, and Arya walks away.  In the Riverlands Riverlands executions Members of the Brotherhood about to die by hanging.  Several men including Gatins and Morgan, members of the Brotherhood Without Banners who took part in the massacre of the villagers, are exchanging jokes over a campsite fire. While joking about sex, the four men are set upon by an axe-wielding Sandor Clegane, who has come to exact revenge for the murder of the villagers. He kills two of them before they can react and dispatches Morgan after a brief scuffle. Sandor then brings his axe up in a powerful swing and buries it in Gatins' groin, causing his innards to drop out. Sandor demands to know where the one with the yellow cloak is and gets a \"Fuck you!\" in response. The Hound points out that those are terrible last words and gives him one chance to do better. After a moment's thought, Gatins calls him a cunt and Sandor remarks that Gatins is \"shit at dying\" before literally cutting him short.  Later, Sandor stumbles upon a forest clearing where he finds that seven members of the Brotherhood including leaders, Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, are in the process of hanging Lem Lemoncloak and other two renegades for their role in the unauthorized attack on the Riverlands village. As the three condemned men stand on blocks with nooses around their necks, Sandor explains they killed his friend and he therefore wants to kill the men himself. Sandor wants to inflict a harsher death upon them than hanging, but Beric stops him. Out of respect for Sandor's loss, Beric agrees to let him kill two of the men.  However Thoros refuses to let him butcher them. Sandor complains, pointing out that in days gone by he would have killed all seven of them to get his way, but ultimately agrees to let them simply hang. Sandor kicks the blocks from under the feet of two of the men including Lem, and takes Lem's boots for himself as the body is still twitching.  Beric kicks the block of the third man.  After the executions, Sandor joins the Brotherhood for a meal by a creek. Beric suggests he should join up with the Brotherhood, that they are fighting for a greater cause and that \"cold winds are rising in the North.\" Sandor is skeptical of their chances of success and distrusts them due to his earlier acrimonious encounter with them. Beric recognizes that Sandor is a warrior and tells him that they are fighting against things that seek to destroy all life. He then tells Sandor that it is not too late to help.  In Meereen Varys and Tyrion in No One Varys is leaving Meereen  In the streets of Meereen, the Red Priestesses preach that Daenerys Targaryen has been sent by R'hllor to end slavery. Tyrion Lannister and Varys enter the market place where they debate the merits of Tyrion's hiring of \"fanatics\" to keep order on Meereen. Varys is leaving on a secret expedition because Daenerys needs friends in Westeros. He parts with Tyrion before reaching the docks as his expedition would not remain secret if he was seen with the most famous dwarf in the city.  As he leaves Tyrion corrects him, \"The most famous dwarf in the world.\"  Later, Tyrion meets up with his advisors Grey Worm and Missandei at the Great Pyramid. He offers to share drinks with them to celebrate the resurgence of the city.  When they express a reluctance, Tyrion convinces them to do it in honor of their Queen. Grey Worm complains of the taste while Tyrion boasts of starting up his own vineyard once Daenerys has conquered the Seven Kingdoms. He asks Grey Worm and Missandei to tell jokes but they do not know how to.  He makes a joke about Westeros Lords, but Grey Worm expresses puzzlement and it becomes clear he doesn't know what a joke is.  Missandei explains, then realising she is enjoying the wine she tells her own joke about two translators. Tyrion feigns amusement but Grey Worm says that it was the worst joke he has ever heard.  As the others react with confusion, he reveals he was making his own joke. Missandei laughs and Grey Worm himself smiles.  Daenerys returns No One Dany finally returns to Meereen.  Before Tyrion can tell another joke, they hear the sound of bombardment. Looking out the ramparts, they see a large fleet of ships from Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis. Missandei tells Tyrion that the slavers have come to reclaim their property. By evening, the slavers' fleet are using trebuchets to bombard the city, causing much damage to Meereen. Admitting that diplomacy has failed, Tyrion lets Grey Worm take command of the battle. Grey Worm proposes defending the pyramid instead of fighting on the beach. At that point, they hear movement on the roofs. After venturing out onto the balcony, they discover that Dany has returned with her dragon Drogon.  In King's Landing Mountain kills No One Ep The Mountain kills one of the Faith Militant by decapitation.  Qyburn informs Cersei that the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep and they demand to see Cersei. Among the Faith Militant is Lancel, who tells Cersei that the High Sparrow would like to speak to her in the Sept of Baelor. However, Cersei refuses, even when Lancel warns her that it was a command and not a request. Cersei retorts that the High Sparrow promised that she could stay in the Red Keep until her trial, to which Lancel replies that no such promise was made. When Ser Gregor Clegane threatens the Faith Militant, Lancel tells Cersei to order him aside or there would be violence. Cersei refuses to let the Kingsguard stand down. One of the Faith Militant proceeds to attack Gregor in the chest, penetrating his armor, but Gregor seems unharmed. In retaliation, the Kingsguard rips off his head, forcing Lancel and his men to stand down.  Later on, Cersei, Qyburn and Ser Gregor enter the Great Hall to find a large crowd as there was a royal announcement.  Cersei asks Kevan Lannister why she was not informed.  Kevan bars her from standing beside her son and tells her that her place was in the gallery \"with the other ladies of the court.\" Cersei reluctantly takes her place there while the other women hurry aside, not wanting to be near her or Gregor.  King Tommen Baratheon starts by saying that the Crown and the Faith are the two pillars that hold up this world, and should one collapse, so does the other. He also says that The Father judges them all, and if they break his laws, they shall be punished. He announces that Loras Tyrell and Cersei's trial will be held in the Sept of Baelor on the first day of the festival of The Mother.  Cersei No One Cersei discovers that trial by combat is now forbidden in her trial.  After much prayer and reflection, he also announces, he has decided that trial by combat will be forbidden in the Seven Kingdoms, calling it a scheme made by those who want to escape true judgement from the Gods, and that Loras and Cersei would stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earlier days of the Faith.  As the King leaves, Qyburn tells a shocked Cersei, who had been planning on calling for a trial by combat with Gregor as her champion, that his little birds have been investigating an old rumor that she had told him about, and that it was found to be much more than a rumor.  At Riverrun Brienne and jaime no one Brienne and Jaime see each other again in Riverrun.  Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne travel to Riverrun to deliver Sansa Stark's letter to Brynden Tully. Upon arriving, they discover that the Lannisters and Freys are besieging the castle. Soon, they are surrounded by several Lannister horsemen. Brienne tells them that she has come to see Ser Jaime Lannister and that she has come to return his sword, Oathkeeper. While Brienne speaks with Jaime, Podrick is waiting in the camp, when he is suddenly put in a choke-hold by an unseen figure, who is revealed to be Bronn. The sellsword is jubilant to see Podrick, and playfully ribs him about sex and his fighting skills before Bronn offers to give Podrick a lesson in dirty fighting -- the kind that he will really need, not the formal kind, that Brienne has been giving him for 2 hours a day.  Jaime and Brienne meet discreetly in a tent. While Brienne has found Sansa, their situation is complicated by a bounty that Cersei Lannister has placed on Sansa's head. Brienne tells Jaime that she has come to secure Brynden's help in seeking reinforcements for her campaign to retake Winterfell from the Boltons. This is not possible because Jaime is laying siege to Riverrun. Brienne convinces Jaime to let her negotiate with the Blackfish so that Brynden and his men can leave the castle at night to travel to Winterfell. Jaime agrees to grant Brynden safe passage but says that he has to surrender by nightfall. Brienne also tries to return her sword, Oathkeeper, because the use it was lent to her for has been fulfilled. Instead, Jaime tells her to keep it because it is hers. She reminds him that, should she fail to get the Blackfish to surrender, her oath to Lady Catelyn Stark would compel her to fight against Jaime. Clearly moved by his admiration for her, Jaime replies, \"Let's hope it doesn't come to that.\"  Brienne and Podrick enter Riverrun to negotiate with the Blackfish. However, Brynden refuses to relinquish his ancestral seat. Brienne then tells him of her oath to aid his grand-niece Sansa and shows him Sansa's letter. While sympathetic to his grand-niece, the Blackfish is unable to help. Brienne then tells Podrick to get a maester to fetch a raven and send a message to Sansa telling her that she failed to secure help from Brynden.  Later, Jaime visits the captive Edmure Tully and apologizes for the conduct of the Freys. Edmure is still defiant and insists that his uncle will not surrender Riverrun. Jaime then informs Edmure that he had sired a son with Roslin Frey. If Edmure can convince the Blackfish and the garrison to surrender, he offers to allow Edmure and his family to live in a comfortable exile at Casterly Rock. He also offers to give Edmure's son a proper education and some lands when he comes of age. When Edmure denounces Jaime as an evil man, Jaime responds that he would let the gods decide. Edmure then asks Jaime how he sleeps at night after all the bad things he has done.  Brienne no one season 6 blackfish Brienne delivers Sansa's letter to Blackfish.  Jaime then recounts his time as a captive of Lady Stark and how she struck him with a stone. Despite her hatred for him, he came to respect Catelyn for her undying love to her children. Jaime compares Catelyn's love for her children to Cersei Lannister's love for her own. He then reiterates that he loves Cersei so much that he would kill any Tully that stands in his way. Jaime then issues his final ultimatum to Edmure. If the Tullys do not surrender, he will catapult Edmure's son over the wall and kill every Tully who stands between him and Cersei. Jaime then leaves to let Edmure make up his mind.  Edmure seemingly accepts Jaime's offer and walks back to the castle with a torch. He announces himself as their rightful lord and convinces the guards to lay down the draw bridge despite the protests of his uncle Brynden. The guards obey Edmure because they have sworn an oath of fealty to Hoster Tully and his son. The guards lower the drawbridge and Edmure enters the castle. Back at the Lannister and Frey lines, Lothar Frey criticizes Jaime for losing their most valuable hostage. Once inside, Edmure climbs the ramparts and orders the Tully garrison to lower the drawbridge and to surrender to the Lannisters and Freys. Jaime and the Lannister and Frey hosts then march into Riverrun and occupy the castle, draping the Lannister and Frey banners all over the walls.  Edmure then orders his men to find and put the Blackfish in chains and hand him over to the Freys. However, the Blackfish has already escaped. At one of the castle's exits, he helps Brienne and Podrick into a boat. Brienne tries to convince Brynden to come along, but he insists on not running away from this fight. He tells Brienne to continue serving Sansa and assures her that she will do a better job of it than he has done. As Brienne and Podrick escape, the Blackfish stays behind for a final stand against several Lannister soldiers. On the ramparts, Jaime is informed of the Blackfish's death. He then sees Brienne and Podrick rowing away on their boat. He quietly waves goodbye, to which Brienne waves back."], "review": ["My review of the episode :)\u201cA girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell.

But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence.  The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.  Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery,  - a city without Masters - (explosions)  it proves that no one needs a Master.  Good.  Shall we begin?  Do we have a plan?  I will crucify the Masters.  I will set their fleets afire,  kill every last one of their soldiers,  and return their cities to the dirt.  That is my plan.  You don't approve?  You once told me you knew what your father was.  Did you know his plans for King's Landing  when the Lannister armies were at his gates?  (explosions)  Probably not.  Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me.  He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep,  the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,  all the major thoroughfares.  He would have burned every one of his citizens.  The loyal ones and the traitors.  Every man, woman, and child.  That's why Jaime killed him.  This is entirely different.  You're talking about destroying cities.  It's not entirely different.  I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.  Once before, I offered you peace.  If you had not been so arrogant,  you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships.  Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot  like the beggar queen you are.  Tyrion: We are here to discuss terms of surrender,  not to trade insults.  The terms are simple.  You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid  and the city of Meereen.

The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain  to be sold again to the highest bidder.  The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.

(dragons screeching)  (horses whinnying)  You don't have to be here.  Yes, I do.  My beloved wife.  I've missed you terribly.  Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely.  Now, dismount and kneel before me,  surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell  and Warden of the North.  I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch.  I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house.  Come, bastard,  you don't have the men, you don't have the horses,  and you don't have Winterfell.  Why lead those poor souls into slaughter?  There's no need for a battle.  Get off your horse and kneel.  I'm a man of mercy.  You're right.  There's no need for a battle.  Thousands of men don't need to die.  Only one of us.  Let's end this the old way.  You against me.  (chuckling)  I keep hearing stories about you, bastard.  The way people in the North talk about you,  you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked.  Maybe you are that good.  Maybe not.  I don't know if I'd beat you.  But I know that my army will beat yours.  I have 6,000 men.  You have, what, half that?  Not even?  Aye, you have the numbers.  Will your men want to fight for you  when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?  He's good. Very good.  Tell me, will you let your little brother die  because you're too proud to surrender?  How do we know you have him?  Now, if you want to save--  You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.  Sleep well.  She's a fine woman, your sister.  I look forward to having her back in my bed.  And you're all fine-looking men.  My dogs are desperate to meet you.  I haven't fed them for seven days.  They're ravenous.  I wonder which parts they'll try first.  Your eyes?  Your balls?  We'll find out soon enough.  In the morning, then, bastard.  Jon: If he was smart, he'd stay inside  the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.  That's not his way. He knows the North is watching.  If the other houses sense weakness on his part,  they'll stop fearing him.  He can't have that. Fear is his power.  It's his weakness, too. His men don't want to fight for him.  They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning  It's not his men that worry me.  It's his horses.  I know what mounted knights can do to us.  You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.  We're digging trenches all along our flanks.  They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you,  in a double envelopment.  A pincer move.  They won't be able to hit us from the sides.  Good.  It's crucial that we let them charge at us.  They've got the numbers, we need the patience.  If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue.  Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.  Did you really think that cunt would fight you man-to-man?  No.  But I wanted to make him angry.  I want him coming at us full tilt.  We should all get some sleep.  Tormund: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.  So you've met the enemy,  drawn up your battle plans.  Aye, for what they're worth.  You've known him for the space of a single conversation,  you and your trusted advisors,  and you sit around making your plans  on how to defeat a man you don't know.  I lived with him.  I know the way his mind works.  I know how he likes to hurt people.  Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?  You're right.  You think he's going to fall into your trap.  He won't. He's the one who lays traps.  - He's overconfident. - He plays with people.  He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.  Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks?  I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton.  I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.  You don't know him.  All right, tell me.  What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?  We'll never get him back.  Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,  which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay  than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.  As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested,  which means he won't live long.  We can't give up on our brother.  Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.  Of course he does. What should I do differently?  I don't know. I don't know anything about battles.  Just don't do what he wants you to do.  Aye, that's good advice.  You think that's obvious?  Well, it is a bit obvious.  If you had asked for my advice earlier,  I would have told you not to attack Winterfell  until we had a larger force, or is that obvious, too?  When will we have a larger force?  We've pleaded with every house that'll have us.  The Blackfish can't help us.  We're lucky to have this many men.  - It's not enough. - No, it's not enough. It's what we have.  Battles have been won against greater odds.  If Ramsay wins,  I'm not going back there alive.  Do you understand me?  I won't let ever let him touch you again.  I'll protect you, I promise.  No one can protect me.  No one can protect anyone.  (sighs)  Davos: You think there's hope?  Tormund: I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight.  And they've never seen the free folk fight,  so, yes, there's hope.  You want to avenge your king, don't you?  It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.  It was Stannis himself.  I loved the man.  He lifted me up and made me something.  But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.  - You saw these demons? - What?  No, it's a manner of speaking.  Not actual demons.  Oh.  Well, you loved that cunt Stannis  and I loved the man he burned.  Mance didn't have demons in his skull.  He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch.  I believed in him.  I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night.  But I was wrong just like you.  Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.  Jon Snow's not a king.  No, he's not.  I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight.  You want some?  I have a jug of sour goat's milk  stronger than any of that grape water  you southern twats like sucking on.  No, thanks. It does sound delicious,  but I better keep a clear head.  I can never sleep the night before a battle.  So what do you do all night?  I walk.  Think and walk.  Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp  that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.  (laughs)  Happy shitting.  My lady.  You weren't at the war council.  I'm not a soldier.  Any advice?  Don't lose.  If I do, if I fall  don't bring me back.  I'll have to try.  I'm ordering you not to bring me back.  I am not your servant, Jon Snow.  You're in my camp. I'm the commander.  I serve the Lord of Light.  I do what he commands.  How do you know what he commands?  I interpret his signs  as well as I can.  If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back,  how did I bring you back?  I have no power.  Only what he gives me and he gave me you.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else.  Maybe he brought you here to die again.  What kind of god would do something like that?  The one we've got.  (horn blowing)  Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes?  You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall.  Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height  thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.  \"The height of nobility,\" \"a man of your stature,\"  \"someone to look up to.\"  You're all making the same five or six jokes.  - It was a long time ago. - It was.  And how have things been going for you since then?  Not so well, I gather.  Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys  if things had been going well.  I didn't murder the Stark boys.  But I did things that were just as bad or worse.  And he paid for them.  Doesn't seem like it.  He's still alive.  It was complicated for you, I'm sure,  growing up at Winterfell.  Never quite knowing who you were.  But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?  You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet  with men to sail them.  In return, I expect you want me to support  your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?  Not my claim. Hers.  And what's wrong with you?  I'm not fit to rule.  We can agree upon that at least.  Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?  No more than Westeros.  Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.  He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.  He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.  Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.  You and I have that in common.  We do.  And both murdered by a usurper as well.  Will their ships be enough?  With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.  Barely.  There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.  There are and Euron is building more.  He's going to offer them to you.  So why shouldn't I wait for him?  The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.  He also wants to give you--  His big cock, I think he said.  Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see.  You won't get one without the other.  And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?  I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.  Theon: He murdered our father and would have murdered us.  He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.  The Seven Kingdoms.  All of them.  And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?  Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands.  We ask you to give them back.  And that's all?  We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two  who don't think a woman's fit to rule.  Reasonable.  What if everyone starts demanding their independence?  She's not demanding, she's asking.  The others are free to ask as well.  Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.  They left the world worse than they found it.  We're not going to do that.  We're going to leave the world better than we found it.  You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms  and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms.  No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.  That's our way of life.  No more.  No more.  (horses nickering)  Do you like games, little man?  Let's play a game.  Run to your brother.

Ramsay plays the odds in defense of Winterfell.  Summary In Meereen Dragons destroy ships in Meereen The dragons destroy a ship in the slaver-alliance's fleet.  Daenerys and Tyrion discuss a plan to deal with the Slaver fleet as the pyramid is bombarded with flaming cannonballs. Dany wants to slaughter their army but Tyrion suggests talking to the masters about terms of surrender, reminding Daenerys about her father's plan to destroy King's Landing using Wildfire and the consequences when his brother Jaime Lannister killed the Mad King. Daenerys, Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm meet with the masters: Razdal mo Eraz of Yunkai, Belicho Paenymion of Volantis, and Yezzan zo Qaggaz of Astapor. They tell Dany that they will let her and Tyrion leave the city if they hand over the Unsullied and Missandei to be resold into slavery, and allow her dragons to be slaughtered. She tells them that she had agreed to meet with them as she was offering them a chance to surrender as Drogon flies in to meet her. She rides Drogon into the bay as Rhaegal and Viserion break free from captivity beneath the Great Pyramid to join them and they begin to burn a few ships in the attacking fleet. Meanwhile, Daario arrives at Meereen with Daenerys's Dothraki horde and rout the Sons of the Harpy at the city gates. The Masters' soldiers abandon them at Grey Worm's invitation, and Tyrion gives an ultimatum that one of the three masters must die, as punishment for their disobedience.  Yara and Dany make a pact Dany and Yara meet, making a pact.  Yezzan, the lowest of the three, is immediately scapegoated by the other two for not being highborn. As Yezzan kneels on the ground and begs Grey Worm not to kill him, Grey Worm instead slits the throats of Razdal and Belicho with one slash of his dagger. Tyrion tells Yezzan to share what he had seen in Meereen and of what Daenerys is capable of. In the aftermath, Dany and Tyrion meet with Theon and Yara who have arrived in the city. They offer Dany their fleet of a hundred manned ships if she will help them deal with Euron and support their claim to the Iron Islands. Tyrion is wary of Theon based on what he saw of him at Winterfell and of his crimes against the Starks, but Theon insists that he has paid for what he has done. Daenerys agrees to support an independent kingdom of the Iron Islands, on the condition that the Ironborn will cease all raiding, reaving, pillaging, and rape. Yara balks at this, but Daenerys says their fathers \u2013 Aerys, Tywin, and Balon \u2013 all left the world worse than they found it, but Dany, Tyrion, Yara, and Theon are going to leave it better than they found it. Swayed, Yara agrees. Daenerys and Yara seal their pact.  In the North Battle of the Bastards 18 Jon asks Melisandre not to resurrect him again, should he fall in the upcoming battle.  Jon, Sansa, Tormund, Davos, Lyanna, and the other Northern lords that declared for House Stark have a parley with Ramsay, Harald Karstark, and Smalljon Umber before they commence battle. Ramsay offers surrender terms, saying he will pardon Jon for deserting the Night's Watch and the Northerners in Jon's forces for rebelling against him if Jon hands over Sansa. Jon refuses and offers Ramsay a chance to settle their dispute in one-on-one combat. Ramsay rejects a one-on-one combat with Jon, noting that he doubts he can best Jon in a duel but he is confident his numerically superior forces will triumph in battle. Jon counters that Ramsay's men may not want to fight for him if he will not fight for them. In response, Ramsay threatens Rickon. Jon and Sansa are wary of whether Ramsay actually has their brother to which Umber throws out Shaggydog's head as proof. Sansa refuses the terms of surrender and tells Ramsay he will die the following day before riding off. Battle of the Bastards 20 Jon and his army readying to fight.  After a meeting where Jon discusses the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa admonishes Jon for attacking too early, insisting that they should have gathered more men. Jon retorts that this is the largest army they could possibly gather. Sansa, knowing Ramsay the best, warns Jon of his cunning and cruel nature, but Jon assures her that he has faced worse. In the end, he promises to protect Sansa from Ramsay, to which she cynically replies that no one can keep anyone safe.  In the camp, Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving both Stannis and Mance respectively, with both acknowledging that they may have been serving the wrong king. After parting ways, Tormund goes to drink and Davos takes a walk. As the sun rises, he comes across the pyre on which Shireen Baratheon was sacrificed, and in the remains, finds the wooden stag he carved and gave to her the last time they were together. He finally realizes how she died. Meanwhile, Jon meets with Melisandre and orders her not to bring him back if he should fall in the battle. Melisandre contends that she will try anyway, and that it was not her gift that has brought Jon back but the Lord of Light's, and that only the Lord of Light can decide Jon's fate. Melisandre ponders that the Lord of Light may have brought Jon back to only die in the battle. Battle of the Bastards 34 Rickon is murdered just before battle.  The armies gather the following morning as Ramsay brings out Rickon. After menacingly raising a knife, he cuts Rickon's bonds and tells him that they are to play a game. The only rule is to run towards his brother. As he does so, Ramsay pulls out a bow and nocks an arrow, prompting Jon to urgently ride out on horseback to try to save Rickon as Ramsay fires arrows at him. Ramsay appears to have no intention of hitting Rickon with his first shots but, just as Jon approaches his brother, Rickon is struck in the back with an arrow and killed. Devastated and enraged over his brother's murder, Jon charges at Ramsay and the Bolton forces alone. Davos tells the Stark cavalry to charge. The Bolton archers fire at Jon and strike his horse. With Jon now defenseless in the middle of the battlefield, Ramsay orders the Bolton cavalry to charge at him.  Battle of bastards s6 scene Jon fears the end is nearing and the battle is lost.  As Jon brandishes Longclaw and prepares to fight to the death, the Stark cavalry smashes into the Boltons, narrowly saving Jon from being trampled. In the rear, Davos belays his order to his archers to release arrows into the melee of infantry, as he announces that they would kill his men, engaged in close-quarter fighting, as well the enemy. He eventually sends the archers forward to be of more use in the middle of the battlefield. Ramsay, however, has no such compunction; he has twice the men to lose and little concern for killing his own. He repeatedly and purposefully orders arrow fusillades that kill all combatants in the middle of the field, apparently in an effort to create a strategic barrier of human death in the center of the battlefield.  The Stark forces seem unaware of this strategy and developing trap. Bolton soldiers are ordered forward to create an impenetrable horseshoe formation of tall shields and spears (in a phalanx configuration) that surround three sides of the Stark forces against the death mound and progressively compresses them into a helpless and dysfunctional mass. Simultaneously, Smalljon Umber leads a group of soldiers across the mound of corpses to attack the beleaguered Stark infantry from behind and complete the deadly envelopment. While Wun Wun is able to kill a few Bolton soldiers, it is not enough to break their phalanx. Panic sets in and Tormund, sensing futility, urges his wildlings backward towards the pile and possible escape.  Sansa arrives at battle Littlefinger and Sansa arrive with Arryn forces.  Amidst all of this, Jon is trampled by his own forces, nearly suffocating under a group of men crawling on top of him, but is eventually able to get back to his feet. At this point, where the Stark forces face imminent destruction, a horn sounds out in the distance as Sansa and Littlefinger arrive with the Knights of the Vale, waving banners bearing the Arryn sigil. On horseback, they begin to cut down the Bolton soldiers from behind to disrupt the encirclement. Smalljon, momentarily distracted by the arrival of the Arryn forces, is caught off-guard by Tormund, who bites out his foe's throat and then kills the stricken northman, stabbing him multiple times in the face with a dagger.  As Ramsay sees his soldiers being cut down, he decides to retreat inside Winterfell, but Jon, Wun Wun, and Tormund begin to give chase. His general insists the battle is lost but Ramsay assures him they still have Winterfell, and the Stark Army is too weak for a siege (despite the Vale reinforcements). Wun Wun, however, is able to break down Winterfell's gates, allowing wildling archers to pour into the castle; the last vestiges of the Bolton garrison are quickly overwhelmed and slaughtered. The giant is nevertheless overwhelmed by arrows and finally killed by Ramsay's shot. Despite the defeat of his army, he taunts Jon, saying he has reconsidered the option of one-on-one combat. As Jon approaches, Ramsay fires three arrows at him with his bow but Jon blocks them all with a Mormont shield that he picked up from the ground. Before Ramsay can fire the fourth arrow, Jon gets close enough and smacks the bow out of Ramsay's hands before striking him in the chest with the shield with enough force to send Ramsay down. Before Ramsay can stand up, Jon pounces on him and proceeds to savagely beat him with his fists, while Ramsay uncharacteristically does not attempt to defend himself and fight back, merely grinning maniacally through the beating, convinced Jon won't kill him. Though it seems Jon is fully willing to beat Ramsay to death, he stops upon noticing Sansa, realizing she has as much right for revenge as he does, and subsequently orders Ramsay locked up as a prisoner.  Ramsey about to be eaten Ramsay is devoured by his own hounds.  The Bolton banners on Winterfell are torn down and the Stark banners are raised in their place. Melisandre looks over the courtyard while Davos glares at her from below, clutching Shireen's burned stag. Jon orders Rickon's body to be buried next to his father in the crypts as Sansa demands of Jon to tell her where he is keeping Ramsay prisoner.  That night, Sansa goes to Ramsay's kennels to confront Ramsay, who is lashed to a chair within the common area of the kennels. Ramsay, belligerent and sadistic to the end, goads her by telling her how she will never be rid of him because he is \"part of [her] now.\" Sansa retorts that Ramsay's deeds and names will disappear from future memory. He then realizes that his hounds are slowly approaching him, Jon having deliberately left the kennel doors open to where Ramsay is bound, still covered in his own blood. At first, Ramsay denies his peril, claiming that his dogs are loyal to him. Sansa coolly reminds him that he had been starving his dogs for a week. As they begin sniffing at him and licking their chops, Ramsay desperately orders them to heel, but they refuse to listen, and as Ramsay's smug overconfidence finally crumbles into panicking terror, the hounds attack and begin to tear him apart as Sansa walks away, smirking with dark satisfaction as the barking of the hounds mingles with Ramsay's screams.

The Tullys mocked me for years.  The Starks mocked me.  Where are they now?  You talk about war as if you're an expert,  but the one battle I remember you fighting,  you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.  But it doesn't matter.  Here we are now, two kingslayers.  We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces  and snigger behind our backs.  We don't mind, do we?  Fear is a marvelous thing.  They don't fear the Freys, though.  They fear the Lannisters.  We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands.  If we have to ride north and take them back for you  every time you lose them,  why do we need you?  Show me.  Your Grace, there's no need--  Show me.  What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?  As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option,  perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?  He should be with his grandfather,  his brother, his sister.  Burn him  and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.  (horse whinnies)  Whoa, whoa.  (birds cawing)  Hello.  From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.  I'm--  I'm to be the new maester.  Oh.  According to our records,  Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.  He died.  We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.  Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election.  He's since passed away.  Which is why I'm here.  This is irregular.  Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.  The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you.  In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library.  Follow me.  No women or children.  (door closes)  (door opens)  (door closes)  (cawing)  - (distant chatter) - (distant metal clanging)  When we had feasts,  our family would sit up here  and I'd sit down there.  Could have been worse, Jon Snow.  You had a family.  You had feasts.  (chuckles)  Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.  What is that?  Tell him.  Tell him who it belonged to.  The Princess Shireen.  Tell him what you did to her.  Tell him!  We burned her at the stake.  Why?  The army was trapped. The horses were dying.  - It was the only way. - You burned a little girl alive!  I only do what my Lord commands.  If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil.  We are standing here because of him.  Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.  I loved that girl like she was my own.  She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!  So did her father.  So did her mother.  Her own blood knew it was the only way.  The only way for what?  They all died anyway.  You told everyone Stannis was the one.  You had him believing it, all of them fooled.  - And you lied. - I didn't lie.  I was wrong.  Aye, you were wrong.  How many died because you were wrong?  I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder.  She admits to the crime.  Do you have anything to say for yourself?  I've been ready to die for many years.  If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not.  You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.  You know the great war is still to come.  You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon.  And you know I can help you win that war.  Ride south today.  If you return to the North,  I'll have you hanged as a murderer.  If you ever come back this way,  I will execute you myself.  I'm having the lord's chamber prepared for you.  Mother and Father's room?  You should take it.  I'm not a Stark.  You are to me.  You're the Lady of Winterfell.  You deserve it. We're standing here because of you.  The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in.  They came because of you.  You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.  - He did. - And you trust him?  (chuckles) Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.  I should have told you about him,  about the Knights of the Vale.  I'm sorry.  We need to trust each other.  We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.  We have so many enemies now.  Jon.  A raven came from the Citadel.  A white raven.  Winter is here.  Well, Father always promised, didn't he?  The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,  he was assassinated.  100 red scorpions, was it?  You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.  You murder your own prince,  but you expect me to trust you?  We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.  You came to Dorne because you needed our help.  What is your name again?  Barbaro?  - (chuckles) - Obara.  Obara. You look like an angry little boy.  Don't presume to tell me what I need.  Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--  Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?  No? Good.  Let the grown women speak.  The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell.  They have declared war on Dorne.  We must be allies now if we wish to survive.  Cersei stole the future from me.  She killed my son.  She killed my grandson.  She killed my granddaughter.  Survival is not what I'm after now.  You're absolutely right.  I chose the wrong words.  It is not survival I offer.  It is your heart's desire.  (rings)  And what is my heart's desire?  Vengeance.  Justice.  (footsteps)  Fire and blood.  Your ships are nearly ready.  I saw them painting the sails.  I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.  You're not coming with us.  New strategy?  You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast?  If we take Casterly Rock,  the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.  You're not going to Westeros.  You're staying here with the Second Sons.  There's finally peace in Meereen.  You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.  Fuck Meereen.  Fuck the people.  I'm here for you, not them.  You promised me.  \"My sword is yours. My life is yours.\"  This is what I command.  If I'm going to rule in Westeros,  I'll need to make alliances.  The best way to make alliances is with marriage.  Who are you marrying this time?  I don't know. Maybe no one.  But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table?  Are you a queen or fish bait?  I can't bring a lover to Westeros.  A king wouldn't think twice about it.  So that's what you want? To be my mistress?  I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat  sits beside you in the throne room.  I don't want a crown. I want you.  I love you.  And I make you happy.  You know I do.  Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.  I can't.  The dwarf told you to do this?  No one tells me to do anything.  Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic.  I'm no use to you over there.  Don't get angry.  I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.  Who comes after you?  Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?  A great number of women, I imagine.  Specific orders will be left for you  regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.  Bay of Dragons?  We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?  You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it.  I hope it brings you happiness.  I pity the lords of Westeros.  They have no idea what's coming for them.  Farewell, Daario Naharis.  (footsteps)  How did he take it?  No tears.  I know it was hard for you.  You turned away a man who truly loves you  because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler,  if it's any consolation.  It's not.  No, I suppose not.  I'm terrible at consoling.  Yes, you really are.  All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening?  You have your armies, you have your ships,  you have your dragons.  Everything you've ever wanted  since you were old enough to want anything,  it's all yours for the taking.  Are you afraid?  Good.  You're in the great game now.  And the great game's terrifying.  The only people who aren't afraid of failure  are madmen like your father.  Do you know what frightens me?  I said farewell to a man who loves me.  A man I thought I cared for.  And I felt nothing.  Just impatient to get on with it.  He wasn't the first to love you  and he won't be the last.  Well, you have completely failed to console me.  For what it's worth, I've been a cynic  for as long as I can remember.  Everyone's always asking me to believe in things--  family, gods, kings, myself.  It was often tempting  until I saw where belief got people.  So I said no, thank you to belief.  And yet here I am.  I believe in you.  It's embarrassing, really.  I'd swear you my sword,  but I don't actually own a sword.  It's your counsel I need.  It's yours.  Now and always.  Good.  I, um  I had something made for you.  I'm not sure if it's right.  Tyrion Lannister,  I name you Hand of the Queen.  You're not one of mine, are you?  No, my lord.  Didn't think so.  Too pretty.  Where are my damn moron sons?  Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.  They're here, my lord.  Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?  Tell them to come here now.  But they're already here, my lord.  Here, my lord.  They weren't easy to carve.  Especially Black Walder.  (breathing heavily) What  My name is Arya Stark.  I want you to know that.  The last thing you're ever going to see  is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.  (knife blade rings)  (groaning)  Forgive me, my lady  if you're at prayer.  I'm done with all that.  I came here every day when I was a girl.  I prayed to be somewhere else.  Back then I only thought about what I wanted,  never about what I had.  I was a stupid girl.  You were a child.  What do you want?  I thought you knew what I wanted.  I was wrong.  No, you weren't.  Every time I'm faced with a decision,  I close my eyes and see the same picture.  Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself  will this action help to make this picture a reality?  Pull it out of my mind  and into the world?  And I only act if the answer is yes.  A picture of me on the Iron Throne  and you by my side.  It's a pretty picture.  News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.  I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.  You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish.  It's never stopped you from serving yourself.  The past is gone for good.  You can sit here mourning its departure  or you can prepare for the future.  You, my love,  are the future of House Stark.  Who should the North rally behind?  A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark  born here at Winterfell  or a motherless bastard born in the south?  This is where I leave you.  You're not coming with us?  The Wall is not just ice and stone.  Ancient spells were carved into its foundations.  Strong magic  to protect men from what lies beyond.  And while it stands, the dead cannot pass.  I cannot pass.  Where will you go?  The great war is coming  and I still fight for the living.  I'll do what I can  as long as I can.  Thank you, Uncle Benjen.  I wish you both good fortune.  Are you sure you're ready for this?  I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.  I have to be ready for this.  (woman screaming)  Woman: Ned?  Lyanna.  Is that you?  Is that really you?  You're not a dream?  No, I'm not a dream.  I'm here.  Right here.  I've missed you, big brother.  I've missed you, too.  I want to be brave.  Shh.  You are.  I'm not.  I don't want to die.  You're not going to die.  Get her some water.  - No, no water. - Is there a maester?  Listen to me, Ned.  (whispering)  If Robert finds out, he'll--  you know he will.  You have to protect him.  Promise me, Ned.  Promise me.  (baby crying)  Promise me, Ned.  Promise me.  You can't expect Knights of the Vale  to side with wildling invaders.  We didn't invade. We were invited.  Not by me.  The free folk, the northerners,  and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely,  fought together, and we won.  My father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.  The Boltons are defeated.  The war is over.  Winter has come.  If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years.  We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.  The war is not over.  And I promise you, friend,  the true enemy won't wait out the storm.  He brings the storm.  (men murmuring)  Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,  but you refused the call.  You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover,  but in their hour of greatest need,  you refused the call.  And you, Lord Cerwyn,  your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton.  Still you refused the call.  But House Mormont remembers.  The North remembers.  We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.  I don't care if he's a bastard.  Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.  He's my king from this day until his last day.  (men murmuring)  Lady Mormont speaks harshly  and truly.  (men murmuring)  My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.  I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime.  I didn't commit my men to your cause  'cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing.  But I was wrong.  Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.  - (men murmur) - Manderly: He is the White Wolf.  The King in the North.  (murmuring)  I did not fight beside you on the field  and I will regret that until my dying day.  A man can only admit when he was wrong  and ask forgiveness.  There's nothing to forgive, my lord.  There will be more fights to come.  House Glover will stand behind House Stark  as we have for a thousand years.  (men murmur)  And I will stand behind Jon Snow  the King in the North!  - The King in the North! - (cheering)  All: The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  The King in the North! The King in the North!  (chanting fades)  Man: Company halt!  Halt!  Halt!  Come on.  I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister  First of Her Name,  Queen of the Andals and the First Men,  Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.  Qyburn: Long may she reign.  Crowd: Long may she reign.

Where great families live and die for the Iron Throne.  They're all weaving these tangled webs.  Some are noble.  Jon Snow's everybody's hero.  Some are not.  - If you're gonna be bad, be really bad. - I want my crown!  So many kings and queens in waiting.  It's about power and greed.  But an icy foe may well end them all.  When's it start?  Season seven is coming and so are the dragons.  So let's burn through the epic saga to date.  This is what Game of Thrones does, it  - it sucks you in. - With Game of Thrones: The Story So Far.  When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.  There is no middle ground.   As season one opens, it's the calm before the storm.  King Robert Baratheon rules from the capital King's Landing  but his days are numbered.  To be king in Westeros, you sit on the Iron Throne in King's Landing  and you're ruling over the Seven Kingdoms.  Start the damn joust before I piss meself!  He's locked in a loveless marriage  and only chose his queen for her family's name  to hold his kingdom together.  I'm very sympathetic to Cersei. She was completely in love with him.  She.. she was in awe of him almost,  and he turned into this almost semi abusive drunk.  Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.  Our marriage.  This unhappy couple have three golden haired children to their name  but Cersei keeps a deadly secret from Robert.  The children are not his.  The truth will be discovered on a royal trip north  and it's here that our story really begins.  The King has asked his old ally Ned Stark to help him rule.  Ned and his wife Catelyn govern the north.  Fiercely loyal to the crown.  The Starks stand for loyalty, integrity bravery.  They are really the moral compass of the show.  They're the good guys and they're the ones  that you find yourself rooting for from the start.  The couple have five children:  three sons and two daughters  and the decimation of this happy family  will reverberate throughout our tale.  They're almost too innocent for that world.  King Robert arrives with his Queen Cersei  and with them is the whole Lannister clan.  That's Jamie Lannister. The Queen's twin brother.  Oh, the Lannisters.  They're blonde they're beautiful they're arrogant,  so fuck them.  And it's really the Lannisters who were going to introduce  a lot of trouble into the lives of the Starks from this point.  The arrival of the Lannisters into that world  totally sends shock waves through the whole family.  Bran Stark goes climbing one day,  gets to the top of the tower  and discovers the Lannister's deepest, dark secret.  The secret is that Cersei the queen  is actually sleeping with her brother Jaime.  The Lannisters, oh god!  They are..  I have never seen a family.. I mean talk about dysfunctional.  Stop! Stop.  It's incest which even in Westeros is generally frowned upon.  It also means that King Robert's children  are not actually his children.  - It's alright, it's alright. - He saw us!  I heard you the first time.  He knows what it means too, and he knows that  if the incest is discovered, not only will  he and his sister be put to death  but their three children may very well too.  And so for Jaime Lannister,  the greatest swordsman in Westeros,  there's only one solution.  The things I do for love.  Here's a convenient way.  The kid'll die,  it'll look like he fell  and our kids will be safe.  First in a coma,  Bran will later awake with no memory of how he fell  or what he saw.  The Royal secret is safe for now  and only the viewer has seen what the Lannisters will do to keep it.  Everything went pear shaped after that and really  that's the whole chain of events starting.  King Robert still wants Ned down in the capital,  so this will be the last ever time  we see the Stark family all together.  A family which includes Ned's son out of wedlock,  the bastard Jon Snow.  Ned must now leave his family  and follow King Robert south  taking his daughters Sansa and Arya with him.  The reason I think that the first season of Game of Thrones works,  is it's essentially about this good family  that just wants to essentially be left alone  and serve their king and their country.  This good family is ripped apart  and thrown into situations that they never anticipated.  They are bound for the capital, King's Landing  where Ned's new task will be to protect King Robert  from those who would unseat him.  And in season one,  viewers learned the greatest enemies live in exile overseas.  The Targaryens.  They were dethroned by King Robert in the last war.  The only surviving members of the family  are a brother and sister called Viserys and Daenerys.  The siblings are the children of the Mad King who was killed in war.  Viserys dominates his younger sister.  Viserys has more than a touch of the Targaryen madness  and you know sometimes he's protecting her  but he's also trying to treat her as a,  - as a bargaining chip. - Come forward my dear.  In search of an army,  Viserys makes a pact with a savage tribe, the Dothraki.  Offering his beautiful young sister  in marriage to their leader, Khal Drogo.  She's the only bargaining chip he has;  he doesn't have any wealth anymore; he doesn't have any armies,  but he has her who he can trade to this horse lord.  I would let his whole tribe fuck you,  all 40,000 men, and their horses too,  if that's what it took.  He's power-hungry but to a nasty degree.  He doesn't really care how or by what means,  he just wants to be important and looked up to.  But his plans backfire.  Daenerys and Khal Drogo fall in love  and become quite the power couple.  Suddenly she finds herself with Khal Drogo empowered.  People are obeying her.  Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back.  He completely underestimates not only Danny but Khal Drogo.  What's he saying?  He says yes.  You shall have  a golden crown.  It's a real coming-of-age story throughout the first season.  She really grows into herself.  - Look away Khaleesi. - No.  This is one of the turning points for Daenerys.  I think this is when you realize that  she's prepared to sacrifice anything for the greater good.  Crown for king.  He was revolting.  He was utterly, utterly revolting,  and that was the moment that she escaped  from her shell. When she became the woman  and not the kowtowed girl.  And as the Targaryens grow in power,  we learn that King Robert faces another challenge  to his northernmost borders.  Threats which led past rulers  to build this giant wall of ice to keep out wild things beyond.  It's protected by the legendary Night's Watch.  The Night's Watch are a small army  who guard the northern border of the country.  In season one, there's lots of fighting for the throne  but actually in the background there are these creatures  appearing north of the Wall  that nobody has seen for thousands of years  and no one quite wants to believe  that they're there but they certainly are.  We hear the characters saying that this is all folklore  or that this is all made up,  but for the viewer we see that basically  these characters do exist. They are there.  I think the White Walkers are really terrifying  mostly because you're not 100% sure,  you know what they're capable of doing  or what their motives are.  They are a serious threat.  In season one, in search of a purpose,  Jon Snow ventures to the Wall and joins the Night's Watch,  a leader in the making.  Jon Snow's everybody's hero,  Jon Snow's one of my favorite characters. He's the dude.  He's also in search of answers.  The question of Jon  Jon Snow's parentage has been one of the burning topics  amongst not only the show's fans but book fans for many decades.  Jon Snow is Ned Stark's bastard son.  He brought him back from a war  and we never really learned who the mother is.  Understandably Catelyn, Ned's wife,  isn't too fond of Jon for that reason.  Try as she may she could never make peace with that,  with the fact that Ned was, unfaithful.  But down in the capital King's Landing,  Ned Stark has a much greater challenge to face.  His daughter has fallen for Prince Joffrey.  She's presented with marrying the future king,  live in a beautiful castle, go to banquets,  have beautiful dresses to wear. A fairy tale story.  Ned has discovered the Queen and her brother are lovers  and this will be his family's undoing.  When the King returns from his hunt I'll tell him the truth.  You must be gone by then,  you and your children.  I will not have their blood on my hands.  But before he gets the chance to talk to King Robert,  King Robert gets himself killed on a hunting trip.  Joffrey is now king, and without Robert to protect him  Ned is tried for treason.  He confesses, believing it will save his daughter,  but misjudges the new ruler.  He's been stuck up in the north too long  and has no idea how the real world operates,  how to really deal with the kind of  the politics of Westeros.  Bring me his head!  That's when you realize nobody is safe in this world at all.  When I saw Sean Bean pushed down  that was the only scene that really has brought a tear to my eye.  It's cruel, it's heartbreaking,  but there's a point to the children witnessing this.  If they want to survive they have to start to be resilient.  They have to learn from this.  It was at that moment you realize  what Game of Thrones was really about.  It's here that the Stark family splinters.  Arya is whisked away by a Night's Watch brother loyal to Ned,  leaving Sansa at the mercy of Joffrey.  Robb Stark reacts with murderous rage  to the news that his father has been beheaded.  Robb's the heir and he's not only picking up his father's mantle  as Lord of Winterfell,  but he's picking up a much older mantle.  The crown that no one has worn for 300 years,  the kingdom of the north.  It will lead to all-out war between the Starks and the Lannisters  who were led by its patriarch Tywin Lannister.  Tywin Lannister is one of the great warriors  and battle strategists of the age.  As well as his twins, Cersei and Jaime,  he has a son he despises, Tyrion, known as the Imp.  You're wounded.  - Good of you to notice. - Tyrion obviously is just brilliant.  - I hear we won. - Stereotypes of what  a hero should be or should look like in Game of Thrones  are just completely blown out the window,  because we've got Tyrion who, you know,  doesn't look like your archetypal hero, but he is.  As war rages in Westeros,  over the Narrow Sea, Daenerys loses a husband  but gains astonishing new powers.  She walks into Khal Drogo's funeral pyre  with fossilized dragon's eggs.  What an epic scene.  Season one ends with the sight of Daenerys  emerging from a fire, unscathed with her dragons hatched.  These creatures are extraordinary creatures  the likes of which have not been seen in hundreds of years.  'Blood of my blood..'  You see these, these three dragons around her and you're, just, like,  they're gonna be awesome when they're grown.  The innocence is gone, she's it.  She's the force now.  As the dragons are born she comes more and more into her own  - until the power becomes innate to her. - It's about a new era.  The whole first season is essentially  the old era dying out; the new era beginning  and by the end she has a sense that  she knows that she's bound for greatness.  And after the break, watch those dragons grow in season two.  Welcome back to Game of Thrones: The Story So Far,  where season two marks a new reign of tyranny  in the capital, King's Landing.  Joffrey is brutalizing his subjects  as well as his bride-to-be Sansa Stark.  You can't!  What did you say?  Sansa has learned some painful lessons along the way.  The chivalrous knights and gallant princes  that she dreamed of, she.. she got a gallant prince  and he turned out to be Joffrey.  Killing you would send your brother a message.  She's a prisoner in the worst place imaginable,  enduring all kinds of psychological and  sometimes physical abuse from these captors.  Leave her face.  I like her pretty.  He's a bully,  and we don't like bullies.  I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.  And you.  He's the product of a brother and sister shagging,  so like you know this might be why he isn't all there mentally.  Cersei's smart enough to realize that Joffrey is  perhaps not what she might have hoped for  and he's getting out of her control now  and he's a danger in part even to her  and even to other members of the family.  What you just did,  is punishable by death.  Joffrey's enemies are everywhere.  Chief amongst them and just across the bay at Dragonstone  is Stannis, brother of the late King Robert,  who believes the throne should be his.  Stannis has learned that Robert's children are Lannister bastards  which means that it is Stannis who is next in line.  So Stannis Baratheon, who knows that  King Joffrey is the product of incest,  decides to send ravens out to all the corners of the Seven Kingdoms  letting them know the Lannister secret.  In order to claim the throne,  Stannis enlists the red priestess, Melisandre,  who was on her own mission to find the right ruler for Westeros.  She believes Stannis is the savior of the world, basically.  He's supposed to be on the Iron Throne  and her magical powers have no limits, I think.  There's there's so much that we don't know that she can do.  However, Stannis isn't the only one after the throne.  His younger brother, Renly also believes he has a claim  and so war is inevitable.  The Iron Throne is mine by right.  All those that deny that are my foes.  The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall.  They both think they should be king  but I'm on Stannis' side, so screw Renly.  Rather than fight it out on the battlefield,  Stannis finds another way to kill his brother.  I guess family ties don't mean an awful lot in Westeros.  The powerful sorcery of the red priestess is revealed  when she gives birth to a sinister weapon.  The shadow baby is basically just a way to kill Renly  and it comes out of me in a great way.  I think Melisandre, she's always lived by this religion.  If she's got something to do she's gonna do it  and she's not gonna let other people stand in her way.  What I think's brilliant about Game of Thrones,  he lives in a fantasy world, it's a completely realistic  depiction of how power works.  What power does to people, what people do to get power  and what happens when they fall short,  when they miss the mark.  That's why it's so brilliant.  When Renly is murdered, he leaves behind his widow, Margaery Tyrell  who belongs to the Tyrell family  who are very rich and powerful in their own right.  Calling yourself king doesn't make you one  and if Renly wasn't a king I wasn't a queen.  Margaery is an absolute piece of work.  You know she wants power.  Do you want to be a queen?  No.  I want to be the queen.  Across the Narrow Sea,  Daenerys Targaryen is learning valuable lessons  in her quest to return to Westeros and seize the throne.  She's desperate to be a good ruler.  That she can, you know, go to bed at night saying  I think I'm doing things the right way.  As Daenerys' power grows, so do her dragons  but as news of their existence spreads,  they become highly sought after.  When she's in Qarth,  everybody's kind of think \"Who are you?  We'll just take your dragons.  We'll take your dragons and you're not powerful anymore.\"  Dracarys!  People have underestimated her, the whole way.  And it is in season two,  that we finally see the dragons kill for Daenerys.  As Daenerys gets stronger in exile,  Jon Snow and the Night's Watch are on a mission beyond the Wall  where the true scale of the threat to the kingdom is revealed.   Blown the horn. When will he come?  The army of the dead is on its way  and it's gonna kick off sooner or later  and really you know they've got to get out of there  - as fast as they possibly can. - One blast for friends,  two for foes.  And three for White Walkers.  The threat of winter coming is very much a myth  to the people of the south.  They're not really taking it seriously.  They don't know about the undead and  all the horrors that are coming towards them.  So what we learn in season two  is that the White Walkers are very much real.  They're nothing like we've ever seen before in television.  They're not just zombies, they're not just statues, they're walking  ice cubes, basically.  They're, they're really bad and they're, really scary  and it's literally, I think it's got to be a fight of Ice and Fire.  We have all these kingdoms wanting to fight for the throne  and they think that that is what ultimately the battle is about  but really at the end of the day, they're not looking  at what's the real problem here and it's the White Walkers.  And it's in season two in King's Landing,  where we see that Tyrion may just be an asset to the war  when Stannis launches an attack on the city.  I'll lead the attack!  Battle of Blackwater was his moment.  He was the best person to speak to the people of King's Landing  and to get them to protect their, their.. their.. their city  because he knows what it's like to fight,  he knows what it's like to have your back up against the wall.  Those are brave men knocking at our door.  Let's go kill them!  Tyrion manages to get the troops fired up  by giving a good speech and  fired up then heads out with them to fight Stannis on the bay.  He doesn't last very long,  he gets knocked out after a couple of minutes.  Tyrion is upstaged by his father Tywin  who arrives with his own massive army bolstered by the Tyrells  who've now firmly joined the cause.  It's that moment where you really see  where power lies.  It's not in the king,  it's in the person behind the king.  The battle is over.  We have won!  And so season 2 ends with the Lannisters victorious.  After the break, season 3 brings more terrible losses for the Starks  when they attend a cataclysmic wedding.  Welcome back to The Story So Far.  Where as season three begins,  Daenerys has set sail on a mission.  She and her dragons may have grown in power and stature  but securing an army still eludes her.  So she ventures to a place where she can buy one.  She knows she needs an army, a powerful army too,  if she ever wants to reclaim the Westerosi throne  and the best bet for that are the Unsullied.  I have dragons.  - I'll give you one. - She appears to want to trade  the dragon for slaves.  She seems to have made this daft agreement  to give away her best dragon.  She hands over the dragon.  Next thing you know once she's got control of the Unsullied    Then it's very easy to say to the dragon  who still will listen to her and not to him,  - burn him. - Dracarys!  Because you would take power if you have the force of a dragon.  They're pretty impressive creatures.  She's been the mother of dragons  and knew she was destined for greatness  but now she really is a queen with an army.  To then see that she has thousands of people  on her team and then you get like this swoop past.  She's got these, like fire-breathing mythical creatures  that are just gonna tear shit up.  As this young Targaryen gains followers,  in King's Landing a young Tyrell is gaining influence.  Margaery has replaced Sansa in Joffrey's affections,  a reward for her family's military support at Blackwater.  I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and  watch something die over there.  Marjorie is a woman who's on top of the game,  she's controlling where she's going,  she's a proper feminist icon.  But the Tyrell's ambitions  are not going down well with Cersei Lannister.  Alana is a matriarch of the family  and she advises her granddaughter  on how best to play the political game  so that she might take power in King's Landing.  To make matters worse,  her soul mate Jaime is a prisoner of war.  He is held first by Brienne of Tarth,  then both are captured by a northern faction.  Looks like your woman's getting the better of you.  This is all bundled up in  when Jaime begins to start thinking about other people.  His efforts to stop Brienne being raped  are the beginning of that.  You know who she is, don't you?  It's good when those little  bits of goodness come in those characters that are so devilish,  as well just give you a little light in there.  Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight  in sapphires  if she's returned to him.  I mean of course it being Game of Thrones it doesn't get him anywhere.  Another one of those Game of Thrones moments  which has so much more going on in it  than just him losing his hand.  He's the greatest swordsman in Westeros we're told,  so he can't do that anymore.  He's now made a good friend in her  and he's seen a lot of things and  I'm sure he's questioning what being a Lannister is about as well.  Yet without his hand,  we see Jaime Lannister at his most heroic.  The heartless knight who pushed Bran Stark from the tower  finds new honor in Season 3.  He's left, he's left her behind,  he's abandoned her  and he's on his way to King's Landing and then,  then his captors mentioned that,  what's gonna happen to her.  Nice bear!  And then he decides to return and save her.  And it is in season three that we witness the fearsome work  of another powerful family, the Bolton's,  who are scheming to take control of the north.  I think the Bolton's want pretty much what everyone else seems to want.  It's power and status.  Kill me!  You're no good to me dead.  We need you.  Ramsay, a bastard son of the family,  enjoys torturing his enemies  including Theon Greyjoy  who he took prisoner when sacking Winterfell after Ned's demise.  Historically, the Bolton's have always been just  just under the Starks, kind of the Starks  have always been on top of them, so I think  they feel that now is their time to rise.  You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.  It's unbelievable what Ramsay is capable of doing to people.  Reek!  He's just all about the mind,  he's all about making you doubt yourself,  he's all about getting in there and making you insecure  and making you feel like you  can't go up against him.  Another hostage at large in season three  is Arya Stark, kidnapped by the Hound.  The disgraced knight plans to find Arya's family  and trade her for cash.  Remember what happens to children who run.  One of the great double acts of Game of Thrones  is the Hound and Arya.  Don't!  - Don't kill him. - There's something so  perversely magical about that pairing,  sort of warped mentor-prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 relationship that develops.  In his desire to claim a ransom,  the Hound heads for the Twins  where he knows Arya's mother and brother,  Catelyn and Robb Stark,  are attending a wedding.  The Twins is a strategic river crossing  controlled by the Frey family  and the Starks need them onside for their war effort.  Walder Frey is a very bitter nasty old man  who controls a small but significant area in the kingdom.  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.  If he's been let down by Robb Stark  after this promise,  if he shows any kind of forgiveness  or, just let it go, we didn't want to marry my daughters,  marry someone else, he would lose face,  in that world, it's a vicious world he's operating in.  The Stark family offer Robb's uncle to make amends  and are here for that wedding,  a terrible mistake.  Catelyn in her heart  knew that you do not break a promise if you are the king of the north  and also you certainly don't break it to Walder Frey.  Your grace  He's probably laid awake for nights  just planning it and timing it and working out  just how it's gonna work out.  The moment when Cat sees that  Roose Bolton is wearing chainmail  is a powerful moment.  Why would you wear chain mail to a wedding,  and what is the purpose of chain mail,  it's to prevent you getting killed.  - Robb! - Even though I'd read the scripts,  the Red Wedding still completely,  was shocking and I was still screaming at the TV,  \"Don't do it, no don't, don't\", you just don't want it to happen.  The Red Wedding is the event that  pretty much decimates an entire generation of the Stark family.  Within the Game of Thrones,  Walder Frey's not playing the Game of Thrones.  He's not attempting to be the king.  He's actually perfectly happy with what he's got.  He has his own little fiefdom  and he's all sitting in the chair watching terrible things.  He's a rotter isn't he.  He's absolutely rotten.  Grim.  The Lannisters send their regards.  It is an ambush backed by Tywin Lannister.  Robb was such an amazing character  and you kind of want him to be the king  and to win.  It's the cruelty of it  and it's the relishing of it.  Everything goes to hell at the Red Wedding.  Arya stark arrives at the Twins  to witness her brother's desecrated body  and loses any last shred of innocence.  She's there. She's there at the Red Wedding, she's outside  and she was so close,  you know she was so close to seeing them again, she was so close.  The path that she goes on,  she learns to become stronger and fight  and also she is after revenge.  And when she comes across her family's killers later  You little shit.   she matches their brutality.  She's had to go over to the dark side,  that's what makes her interesting.  In order to survive in that world,  you've got to match what is given you.  And so by the end of season 3,  all the elder Starks have gone from the Game of Thrones.  Only the children remain,  orphaned and scattered across Westeros,  including Bran Stark, still paralyzed from his fall.  He's fled Winterfell with a loyal band of followers heading north.  So Hodor we know as  - a very loyal character. - It's all right, Hodor.  He lost the use of his legs and Hodor's the person that  carries him around and takes him everywhere.  Being the big giant of a man that he is.  It's all right.  The wolves will protect him.  Him and his brother Rickon are the two last  male heirs to, to the, to the Stark household  and yet it's fast depleting.  We're running out of Starks.  Bran Stark is very much on his own journey  to discover the roots of this ancient magic  that's reappearing in the kingdom throughout the seasons.  And yet amid this loss comes a small victory.  Unlikely hero Samwell Tarly  stumbles on a weakness of the White Walkers.  Samwell reaches for all he has to hand,  an old dragonglass spear he once found in the ground.  To his astonishment it, it works.  The spells are shattered and it's melting before him.  And stay with us to see wedded bliss vanish, after the break.  He's choking!  Welcome back to Game of Thrones: The Story So Far.  We're in season four, a Royal Wedding in King's Landing  unites two great houses of Westeros,  the Tyrells and the Lannisters.  Margaery and Joffrey's wedding  is one of those weddings  that we all have to go to where there's no love in the room.  The wedding brings another great family into the game.  The Martel's, represented by Prince Oberyn.  We're the hottest couple at the wedding  What else is there to say?  - Ellaria Sand. - My lord. My lady.  - Charming. - He has a zest for life,  and all the beautiful things that the world has to offer.  None of it is as beautiful as his own rage  and taste for revenge.  Oberyn is seeking vengeance for his sister's brutal death  - at the hands of the Lannisters. - Rape and murder  of women and children is considered distasteful.  Joffrey really uses the wedding as an excuse  - to be as horrible as he can. - Uncle,  he can be my cup bearer.  He sees it as an opportunity to wield his power because he can.  And you're dying for something to happen to him.  And so an unseen hand poisons the newly wed King.  - Idiots, help your king. - Move away!  It's the moment of retribution that the whole of the Seven Kingdoms  - have been waiting for. - Geoffrey!  I think everybody who watches Game of Thrones  was hoping this day would come.  I wanted to kill him in such a way  that the viewers were reminded that here's a  13 year old boy who's dying.  Though it is actually the Tyrells that have poisoned Joffrey,  it is Tyrion who is blamed.  This is really the point where Tyrion's fragile bonds  with his family begin to unravel.  Take him!  Take Him!  Take Him!  In plot terms, the death of Joffrey  is another shaking of the board where the pieces are scattered  and also it's one of those things that  elevate the whole series from merely a story into a saga.  As the royal family grows weaker,  news from Westeros reaches Meereen  where Daenerys has conquered the city,  but she is not yet ready to capitalize on her enemy's weakness.  King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.  Murdered at his own wedding.  This would appear to be a really good time  for her to finally make her play for the Iron Throne.  She has the dragons and she has the army,  and she has the strength of character.  But actually she has new responsibilities now,  when she has unfinished business where she is,  and she's still trying to learn how to rule.  And to compound matters, her dragons have grown so big  that Daenerys has started to lose control of them.  No!  As they get bigger, as her power increases,  the harder it is for her to manage.  And that's where the story then has to go.  All they're going to bring is complexity.  And when one of the dragons kills a child and abandons her,  Daenerys is left with no other choice  but to chain the other two.  She's just locked up her dragons, so  can she unleash them again, and will they forgive her?  Without the mighty force of her dragons,  Daenerys is faced with a dilemma  as to what to do next.  She's definitely going through a sort of  a dark night of the soul, I think,  where she's trying to determine,  have I got what it takes.  And so in season four, as Daenerys remains in exile,  across the Narrow Sea,  Sansa Stark has fled the capital  and taken refuge with her aunt Lysa,  who has been seduced by an arch schemer.  Littlefinger is playing a very chaotic game  and he thrives on that.  Oh, my sweet wife.  For Littlefinger, it's all about getting power I think,  and using Lysa as a pawn along the way.  Sansa has witnessed Lysa's murder,  and covers for Littlefinger.  Sansa's one of these pure characters who's been  mistreated all through the series.  She's seen a lot of horrible, horrible things happen  and she's never been able to take control  and this is the first time. Actually, she's got nothing else to lose.  When Sansa lied  to protect Littlefinger, I cheered. I thought thank God girl.  He tried to reason with her,  promised her she was the only one he'd ever loved but  she stepped through those doors..  What you discover, is that she's been learning this entire time.  She's been listening, she's been watching.  She's been taking Littlefinger's lessons to heart.  So from one Stark prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 to another,  Sansa's sister Arya is still the Hound's hostage  but they're now on an equal footing.  Who would pass the bloody gate?  The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.  He's her captor but he's also her protector  and you know she's seen his own pain  and his own fear at times and  they've shared some dangerous situations.  But when The Hound is gravely injured in battle,  Arya is forced to strike out on her own.  Fuck it. I'm ready.  Now he's wounded and he's dying  and she's remembering all he said about mercy  and he's asking for mercy  and by mercy he means, you know, a quick thrust to kill him.  And she doesn't give it to him.  Kill me.  She won't put him out of his misery,  she won't give him the easy way out,  she's going to leave him there to suffer.  Another wandering Stark is Arya's crippled brother, Bran,  who has made it north of the Wall  in search of the three-eyed Raven  who he believes will help him walk again.  All the time aided by his loyal traveling companion, Hodor.  I think Hodor's more than just Bran's legs.  I think he means a lot to Bran, you know, someone  he's always been there through absolutely everything, you know,  even though he can't speak, he can only say one word,  he's always someone that's looking after them.  You know, in a world of evil,  he's probably one of the only good ones.  Clearly Bran is very important because he's trekked  all the way up north to a cave where this, this raven  has been summoning him for the past couple of seasons, and  now he's in this cave with the three-eyed raven.  Really we're gonna find out  what, what the grand scheme of things is for Bran.  You'll never walk again.  But you will fly.  His powers, he's getting stronger and there's gonna be some  really exciting things happening  and we're gonna find out more and more about him.  At the Wall, the Night's Watch suffers  a huge wildling attack at Castle Black,  but in season four they get a powerful new ally.  Stannis Baratheon, who's been away licking his wounds  after the Blackwater defeat, joins them with his vast army.  The Battle of the Blackwater was a huge  and crushing defeat at the end of season two  and it's taken them basically two seasons  to sort of rebuild from that,  and his arrival means that Jon Snow could have a new ally  in the battle against the White Walkers beyond the Wall.  If my father had seen the things that I've seen,  he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.  All of them.  Season four draws to a mighty climax in King's Landing  when the ultimate father-and-son showdown comes to a head.  Tyrion is tried for murder.  I'm guilty of being a dwarf.  - You're not on trial for being a dwarf. - Oh, yes I am.  I've been on trial for that my entire life.  He's put on trial for a murder he doesn't commit.  His father deserts him and betrays him.  I demand a trial by combat!  I mean, trial by combat, you can get someone  to fight for your honor, so whether you're wrong or not,  as long as they win the fight that's what matters.  He names Oberyn Martell as his champion.  The one thing that he's ever lived for,  is to avenge his sister's death  and he knows that now that the opportunity is presenting itself,  there is no question that he will get what he wants.  You killed her children!  And he does get what he wants by  forcing a confession out of him.  It's not exactly how he expected it.  I killed her children.  He still technically got what he wanted, you know.  Then I raped her.  Then I smashed her head in like this!  But when Oberyn is defeated,  Tyrion is sentenced to death.  In Westeros the pursuit of justice is  as futile as anything else.  Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.  Is that any way to speak about our mother?  Tyrion is released from jail by his brother Jaime  and told to go and board a ship and run away.  Instead he decides to check in on his father.  But it's his former lover Shae  that he discovers in Tywin's bed.  Tyrion then kills Shae in a sort of fit of jealousy  and then takes a crossbow and goes to find his father.  Tyrion.  Put down the crossbow.  It's so tightly wound, this scene.  This is someone who spent his whole life  trying to win his approbation, as much as he hated him,  he really wanted that, you know.  Obviously that's never gonna happen now  because he put a crossbow bolt in his groin.  What it means, is when a big character like that goes,  there's gonna be a power vacuum and there's gonna be  hustling and jostling to get into his place.  I am the queen!  I am the queen! Have you lost your mind?  Join us after the break, we're in season five  and new power rises in King's Landing.  Welcome back to the Story So Far.  Where in season five, a Royal Wedding unsettles Cersei.  Her son Tommen is now king  and has fallen under the spell of his new Queen, Margaery,  much to Cersei's dismay.  When Margaery come in his life,  I think he was just enjoying life so much.  Judging from the King's enthusiasm,  the Queen Mother will be a queen grandmother soon.  - Wouldn't that be a lovely day. - Him being King  was just a whole new excitement, a whole new life.  Cersei empowers religious fanatics  to help her topple her rival, Queen Margaery.  You can't do this. I am The Queen!  She brings back the faith militant because she's, like, well  hopefully I can clear the board with these guys  and regain some of my power.  But Cersei's engineered her own downfall.  Royalty is no longer above the law  and fanatics come for her next.  There's another contender to power  in Westeros and it's it's religion.  It's the power of the faith.  They want to remove all the excesses,  to strip Cersei of all her finery,  and encourage her, in inverted commas,  to become clean.  A sinner comes before you.  Watching Cersei do the walk of atonement  something happened that I thought would never happen  and that is I felt compassion.  No matter what she'd done previously,  she didn't deserve this.  And so season 5 sees her left naked  before her subjects to atone for her infidelities.  The walk of shame was tough was very, very tough for her.  Very, very few women could have done what she did,  complete that walk.  And you see her  trying to maintain this regal presence  but she can't.  Stripped down to her literally,  physically and emotionally and psychologically  stripped down to her most vulnerable,  and then swept up into the arms of the Beast that she,  that she invited into the world.  The strange creation that is her new knight.  It's just a brilliant twist.  Also getting a new ally in season five is Daenerys,  in the form of Tyrion.  After killing his father, he's fled across the Narrow Sea,  a fugitive on the run.  He was a Lannister  and he had all the money in the world  and a noble name and a big bag of gold  can buy you a lot. All that's gone now.  He's totally at the mercy of  the people he's traveling with.  - Who're you? - And then the unthinkable happens.  - I am the gift. - He's captured and handed over  to his family's greatest enemy,  the Targaryen Queen in Waiting, Daenerys.  My name is Tyrion Lannister.  And between them they are an extraordinary force.  Protect your queen!  She appoints him as her political adviser  but when a civil rebellion begins,  Tyrion gets to witness Daenerys transform into a true Targaryen.  The symbol of the Targaryen's coming to claim their power  is on the back of a dragon. 'Cos I mean,  it's not much you can do  when you're standing on the ground and a dragon's coming at you.  She's had the dragons now for quite a long time  but her actually becoming a dragon rider,  that's her claiming her birthright  more than I think anything else we've seen her do because  that is how the Targaryan's wielded their power.  Vlar!  Everybody painted that picture of Daenerys  flying her dragon, had never really happened,  and I've waited so many years to see that  and she finally does and she does it in a wicked way  where she's escaping death.  Daenerys, she's got the greatest name ever.  Stormborn, Mother of Dragons.  Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen, I love that name.  She's got these dragons as backup  and then she's got Tyrion,  who knows King's Landing,  who knows the political side of things,  and he's been through battles as well.  Yet as season five ends,  Daenerys' dragon delivers her to an uncertain fate.  The last thing we see of Daenerys in season five,  she's surrounded by Dothraki, back where she bloody started.  In season five is one of vengeance for Arya.  The young Stark follows her mentor to Braavos  - to become an assassin. - To serve well,  a girl must become no-one.  Arya's relationship with Jaqen is fascinating.  He is utterly mysterious  and she is seduced by his power.  I didn't come here to sweep floors.  No?  Why come then?  - You said I could be your apprentice. - The power of death,  the power to choose who dies.  And Arya uses her new skills to slaughter Meryn Trant,  a name on her kill list of people who've destroyed her world.  Arya, I think has crossed a line,  and if you look back to season one,  what would Ned Stark think of Arya's actions.  Is that what he would want for his daughter?  There is a sense of vengeance  rather than a sense of justice.  As Arya explores vengeance,  back home the battle is on for the Stark family home.  Stannis Baratheon is marching on Winterfell,  now held by the Bolton's.  But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory.  He's going after something and it is,  it's increasingly futile.  In a desperate move,  Stannis follows the advice of the red priestess  who promises him victory  if he makes an unspeakable offering to the Lord of Light.  She managed to convince him to burn his own daughter.  That's one of the most chilling scenes, I think, of season five,  when, when he burns his child.  She's believed in this god for so many years I think that  if it's not to do with the god she kind of just  blocks everything out  and I think that's what happened as she blocked out  the fact that she was going to be sacrificing a child.  She was sacrificing the King's blood.  Melisandre really thought that Stannis would be the one  and you know she's put a lot of her heart and soul  and everything else into, into helping him.  But it proves to be his undoing.  His men desert him,  and Melisandre, realizing all is lost,  - flees to Castle Black, - Your Grace.  leaving Stannis to advance to Winterfell on his own.  Speak up.  Can't be worse than mutiny.  He's had a rough old time, Stannis, hasn't he.  Because really he should be the king from  after Robert Baratheon dies,  but every battle he loses he becomes  further and further involved with this kind of fantasy.  And awaiting Stannis at Winterfell  are the Bolton's who tried to cement their position in the north  with a tactical marriage to Sansa Stark,  orchestrated by master manipulator Petyr Baelish.  She shouldn't trust Littlefinger,  I mean why are you gonna trust Littlefinger, I mean, geez!  He is the dodgy car salesman in Game of Thrones,  offers you everything and gives you nothing.  May I introduce my son,  Ramsay Bolton.  Now that the Bolton's have kind of  established themselves at Winterfell,  bringing in a Stark will really solidify their position in the north.  But it's a huge miscalculation  that traps her in another brutal relationship.  Ramsay is a horrible, cruel, evil, power-hungry man.  He took psychotic nature to another level.  I mean he went there, and he went some.  Oh, no no no.  You stay here Reek.  You watch.  Fellow-prisoner Theon Greyjoy aka Reek is too terrified to help.  I think we all thought he should have stepped in on the wedding night.  Let's be frank.  With Ramsay distracted by battle,  - You're leaving it to me? - Sansa is caught attempting to escape,  and it's only then that Reek finds the courage  to become Theon again.  Stop! Stop!  I think that was a moment that we all needed to see,  Theon again had been so much at the mercy of Ramsey,  that finally he had a moment where he could do good.  And so by the end of season five,  Sansa has jumped either to her death or to her freedom.  It's someone  being pushed in every way to the absolute limit  of their will to live and  having come through that,  she's obviously gonna be quite a different person.  As Sansa and Theon leap from the walls of Winterfell,  nearby Stannis is facing defeat by the vast Bolton army.  I think Stannis had given up.  I think even before they'd gone into battle,  I think he was going there to die.  Fate finally catches up with Stannis  when he comes face-to-face with Brienne of Tarth  who sought vengeance for Renly's death since season two.  She is probably the toughest person going about,  about Westeros.  But as Stannis bows out,  Jon Snow comes up against a greater foe  when he ventures to Hardhome  to make peace with the Wildlings.  This alliance is sacrilege,  but when the White Walkers launch a full attack,  Jon sees his hunch is right.  All humans must unite to fight them.  What's so great about the whole White Walker mythology  is the way it has been building throughout the series.  Who knows what they want. They would bring  death and destruction to absolutely everything.  Up until this point they've been  semi-mythical characters. It's been  the White Walkers in those cold lands  that no one ever goes to  and here they are in front of the heroes,  then they're very real  and it's a very real danger.  I don't think the White Walkers are afraid of anything.  I think fear is just not in their vocabulary.  And then Jon and the viewers see the Night's King  reveal that he has a greater power.  He can raise and recruit the dead.  It's a challenge to Jon,  and 'look what I can do'.  Forget all the other battles that are going on,  you know, battles for castles and, and kingship, you know,  he's got to focus his army.  But on Jon's return to Castle Black  in the final minutes of season 5,  viewers witness the cruelest blow of all  in a gut churning finale.  When I saw the cross with traitor written on it, I thought oh  no, they're not gonna kill him  and then they did!  For the Watch.  You root for him  but the great thing about Game of Thrones  is your heroes can die any second.  For The Watch.  They're all members of the Night's Watch and  no matter what one of their brothers has done,  what they did was worse than what he did.  And so season 5 ends on betrayal and death.  Is this really the end for Jon Snow?  Only season six holds the answer, after the break.  Welcome back to the Story So Far,  where season six begins at the scene of a crime.  Jon snow lies slain at Castle Black  and all hopes are pinned on the red priestess  and her magic to bring him back.  Game of Thrones needs Jon Snow.  We do, we need him to finish what he started.  As viewers hope for Jon's resurrection,  we learn that Melisandre harbors a great secret.  The reveal of ancient Melisandre  was definitely one of the most stunning surprises  in season six of Game of Thrones.  It shows how much older she actually is  and how much longer she's been believing in this god for.  Then we see her use this power for Jon.  She tries to bring him back to us, to resurrect him, it doesn't work.  When the wolf started to sort of make some noise that's when I thought,  I think everyone thought,  Jon Snow's alive.  And then he's just like that moment of  Jon Snow has returned and all the Westeros rejoices.  And after the miracle of Jon's rebirth,  comes a partial reunion of scattered Starks  when Sansa arrives at Castle Black,  and together they'll gather forces  in a bid to retake the north.  Sansa's become majestic but  she's also become savvy.  She's lost that naivety.  A monster has taken our home  and our brother.  We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.  She's a queen, really.  In terms of being from a powerful family  and being able to make decisions  and tell other people to do stuff,  I think she's gonna tell other people to do stuff.  And across the sea in season six,  another young royal's in similar mood.  Daenerys,  who's been a hostage of the Dothraki,  burns their leaders and converts the tribe.  The huge Dothraki horde.    We're gonna finally get a lot of  different power factions coming together  in a very scary explosive way.  And she also gets a navy,  forging an alliance with the Ironborn who bring ships.  But as Great Houses unite for war,  beyond the Wall we learn more about the deathly foe  which threatens them all.  While time training with a three-eyed Raven,  Bran Stark uncovers a great secret.  White Walkers were created from the first men.  The children of forest  invented the White Walkers to help  protect their own race.  It was an innocent defense  to do that.  But clearly it has gone out of control.  And when the White Walkers come for Bran,  there are terrible casualties.  Hodor is a goner.  Hold the door!  A completely pure act of protection.  There was nothing,  there was no greater goal  to what he did  other than protect Bran.  Everyone who's basically just given  in order to give way for Bran and  there must be a reason, right?  We know he's become the three-eyed Raven.  But how's he going to use those powers.  And as the three-eyed Raven,  Bran resolves a great Stark secret  when he sees Jon Snow's mother  is Ned's sister, Lyanna.  You understand what Ned has been going through the whole time.  He made out that it was his son, his bastard son,  but it was really his nephew.  But it confirms Jon Snow is still half Stark  and in season six,  he and Sansa march on their family seat of Winterfell  to fight Ramsay Bolton,  in what goes down in history as the Battle of the Bastards.  Ramsay's now top dog,  having murdered his father and newborn brother.  Now, if you want to save  You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.  When you play the Game of Thrones,  you either win or you die, you know, and she knows  it's about winning now;  she's had enough of all the rest; it's time to win.  She offers her insight.  You think he's going to fall into your trap, he won't.  He's the one who lays traps.  She's lived with this man for a long time and she knows that,  he is cruel to the core.  - Sansa's words go unheeded. - Let's play a game.  Ramsay baits Jon with his hostage Rickon.  Run to your brother.  It shows a lot about how Ramsay's mind works.  He's calculating; he's always thinking about the next move,  you know it's very interesting how Machiavellian he can be as well.  Ramsay Bolton's, like, yes  I've got you now boy,  just in the middle of no man's land.  That's what Game of Thrones does so brilliantly is, it,  it's constantly pitting good moral forces against bad ones,  and you don't just win because you're good.  They were surrounded by the entire army;  they were being driven into the mud.  Ramsay should have won, he was much more conniving, much more cunning,  and if it hadn't have been for Sansa coming in at the last minute,  then he probably would have won.  Now that Sansa has brought the cavalry,  the Knights of the Vale,  it's a done deal that the Starks are going home.  This was probably the first  major victory in, in six years.  They're suddenly inside the castle.  Winterfell.  It seems Jon will kill Ramsay,  but he then leaves Sansa to take the scalp.  There was only one way to kill him  and Sansa found the right way to do it.  She knows what she's gonna do, and  she knows he deserves it.  All memory of you will disappear.  If you were face to face with your nemesis  and you had the opportunity,  you'd take it.  She's hardcore.  She has the makings of a Cersei.  But it's Jon Snow who becomes king as the season ends  with the Starks controlling the north  and for now Sansa is by his side.  She's a character that will surprise people  because she's not what she seems.  And neither is Sansa's sister Arya.  Blinded and stabbed in her training as a faceless man  she's now back in Westeros to deal with Walder Frey.  She's gone on this mad journey.  Arya comes in disguise,  having chopped up Walder's sons.  They weren't easy to carve.  She wanted him to see who she was.  The face comes off and there's a knife.  The last thing you're ever going to see  is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.  She's been caught up in it so young  that she's turning into this child soldier.  Revenge is a dish best taken cold.  I literally cannot wait now  for her and Cersei to face off.  In fact Cersei elevates revenge to an art form in season six  as the Lannisters fight for their family's very survival.  These royal lovers are united in grief  after the Sand Snakes killed their daughter.  The Lannisters are all about power.  They're all about revenge.  We're the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world,  and everything they've taken from us  we're going to take back and more.  It doesn't matter how long it takes,  they will get you back.  With Jamie sent away to fight revolt,  Cersei is left alone to face judgment by the faith militant.  We are told that Cersei is going to turn up for a trial but  we know perfectly well she's not going to.  But it's now she plays a game-changing hand.  She was always going to have a dastardly plan.  The man who was sent by Cersei to hold Tommen in that room  There's something wrong.  Marjorie knows what's up in an instant.  The High Scept is packed with those who've wronged Cersei.  The Tyrells, High Sparrow and faith militant.  The amazing thing about Game of Thrones  is the spectacle is always incredible  and you never know it's coming.  This isn't gonna end well.  Cersei has, of course, unleashed wildfire.  She's wiped out this fantastic building;  she's destroyed all her enemies.  That's what makes Cersei so brilliant;  she's been to the absolute lowest place  that you could possibly go  and she still comes out on top.  In the moment where she gets her revenge on everyone else, she loses  the only thing that she has left that matters to her.  Knowing that his mum's the one that's  pretty much murdered his wife,  what has he got to live for.  Tommen's death leaves the Iron Throne empty,  so a new reign begins.  A witch told her that she,  she was cursed and that all of her children would die.  It didn't stop her from loving her kids  and trying to protect them at any cost,  but she accepts very swiftly her fate.  And so Jamie returns to a new world order,  courtesy of his sister.  She's devastated the Tyrells.  Now the Lannisters are once more a force to be reckoned with.  Queen Cersei, sitting on the Iron Throne.  I think it's good to see her on the throne,  because it really has been her who's been pushing the men,  and so she should be there, right there or wrongly.  As one Queen takes the throne,  another sets sail to challenge her for it.  Finally Daenerys, the Targaryen Queen  is on her way to Westeros,  with a vast alliance she spent six seasons amassing.  We're now getting to crunch time.  As she comes to conquer,  the burning question for season seven:  who might join her now?  Absolutely everybody against the Lannisters, everyone against Cersei.  Like, Cersei doesn't have a chance.  But they'll fuck with us.  I do have this theory that the White Walkers  will sit on the Iron Throne.

VARYS: I remember that storm.  All the dogs in King's Landing  howled through the night.  I wish I could remember it.  I always thought this would be a homecoming.  Doesn't feel like home.  We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.  Good.  DAENERYS: Not so many lions.  VARYS: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms.  The lords of Westeros despise her.  Even before your arrival, they plotted against her.  - Now - They cry out for their true queen?  They drink secret toasts to my health?  People used to tell my brother that sort of thing,  and he was stupid enough to believe them.  If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back,  he'd have invaded King's Landing already.  Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.  But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.  No.  We can take the Seven Kingdoms  without turning it into a slaughterhouse.  If the great houses support your claim against Cersei,  the game is won.  With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side,  we have powerful allies in the south.  I never properly thanked you for that.  They joined our side, my queen,  because they believe in you.  You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?  I did.  And then you served the man who overthrew him.  I had a choice, Your Grace  serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.  But you didn't serve him long.  You turned against him.  Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure.  There have been few rulers in history  as cruel as the Mad King.  Robert was neither mad nor cruel.  He simply had no interest in being king.  So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.  Your Grace,  when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin,  Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who  Before I came to power, you favored my brother.  All your spies, your little birds,  did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak?  Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?  Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,  I knew nothing about you, save your existence  and that you were said to be beautiful.  So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.  Which you turned to your advantage.  Who gave the order to kill me?  King Robert.  Who hired the assassins?  Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?  Your Grace, I did what had to be done to  To keep yourself alive.  Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.  Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite.  If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one.  What kind of a servant is that?  The kind the realm needs.  Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.  As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them.  I wasn't born into a great house.  I came from nothing.  I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.  When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.  You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?  Not with any king or queen, but with the people.  The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.  The people whose hearts you aim to win.  If you demand blind allegiance,  I respect your wishes.  Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.  But if you let me live, I will serve you well.  I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne  because I choose you.  Because I know the people have no better chance than you.  Swear this to me, Varys.  If you ever think I'm failing the people,  you won't conspire behind my back.  You'll look me in the eye as you have done today,  and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.  I swear it, my queen.  And I swear this if you ever betray me,  I'll burn you alive.  I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.  Forgive me, my queen.  A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.                    She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?  No, it didn't.  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.  We've just decided to pardon those  who once served the wrong king.  The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?  Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord  can serve his cause.  What does your lord expect from me?  \"The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.\"  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.  MISSANDEI: Your Grace, forgive me,  but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian,  so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,  \"The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\"  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?  No, but I like it better.  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?  Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a role to play.  As does another  the King in the North, Jon Snow.  Jon Snow?  - Ned Stark's bastard? - You know him?  I travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.  And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?  Aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is.  As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,  he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall  to protect them from grave danger.  As King in the North,  he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses,  so together they may face their common enemy.  He sounds like quite a man.  Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you  and tell you the things that have happened to him,  the things that he has seen with his own eyes.  I can't speak to prophecies  or visions in the flames,  but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.  And I am an excellent judge of character.  If he does rule the North,  he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father  and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.  Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his queen  invites him to come to Dragonstone  and bend the knee.  (CHATTER)  Gather round. Come here.  SANSA: You think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.  Read the last bit.  \"All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.\"  What does that mean?  It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?  Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  \"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed  as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together, we can end her tyranny.\"  Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde,  a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons  a bit less charming.  What?  Fire kills wights, you told me.  What breathes fire?  You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?  - No, too dangerous. - But?  But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall,  do we have enough men to fight them?  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne,  she'll destroy the realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.  With their help, the Mad King's daughter  has ferried an army of savages to our shores  mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground,  rape and enslave your women,  and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.  - (PEOPLE MURMURING) - CERSEI: You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos, her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that,  she fed them to her dragons.  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will.  But I need your help, my lords.  We must stand together, all of us  if we hope to stop her.  (ALL MURMURING)  She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered  the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?  We are currently at work on a solution, my lord.  (CHATTER)  Lord Tarly.  Ser Jaime.  I believe you know my son.  Ser Jaime.  Rickard, isn't it?  Dickon.  That's it.  Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance, now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.  If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those who defy her.  You ride for Horn Hill today?  I have an army to mobilize.  Won't be long before the fighting starts.  And which side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could do that.  It's a long ride back to the Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei  and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.  All her enemies.  Including Olenna Tyrell.  I'm a Tarly.  That name means something.  We're not oathbreakers. We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back  or cut their throats at weddings.  I swore an oath to House Tyrell.  You swore an oath to the crown as well, Lord Tarly.  I've known Olenna since I was a child.  She was a great woman once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly,  she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister,  but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us  or with foreign savages and eunuchs?  When the war is won,  the queen will need a new Warden of the South.  I can think of no better man  than Randyll Tarly.  EBROSE: The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.  How long?  It'll be years before it kills you.  Could be 10.  Could be 20.  But how long until?  Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer.  (GRUNTS)  Um  Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had the greyscale as a baby and was cured.  - EBROSE: No. - Isn't there some way  EBROSE: Does this look like a baby to you?  - No. - Have you studied  the varying rates of greyscale progression  in infants and fully grown men?  No.  EBROSE: Maester Cressen discovered  Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.  This is quite advanced.  And beyond our skills, ser.  Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once  to live out your life with the stone men.  As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you.  Come, Samwell.  Should we send word to your family, Ser?  Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.  Mormont?  There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.  EBROSE: Come, Samwell!  QYBURN: Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?  No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the throne room.  Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.  They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.  Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  His flames forged the Iron Throne  and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful  but not invincible.  Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons  was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  And if they can be wounded,  they can be killed.  The finest artillators and blacksmiths in King's Landing  have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'll kindly pull that lever.  YARA: If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have.  The city will fall within a day.  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.  It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.  I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.  She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.  DAENERYS: That's enough.  Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.  That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen  who was better loved than my granddaughter.  The common people loved her.  The nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles,  they're all just children, really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you.  I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing.  Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?  We will lay siege to the capital,  surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne,  but no food for her army or the people.  But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros  by appealing to their loyalty,  their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners,  we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi.  And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?  You are.  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.  And her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army  back up to King's Landing.  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital  alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.  So, your master plan is to use our armies.  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?  The Unsullied will have another objective.  For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied  will sail for the Rock and take it.  Do I have your support?  You have mine.  Dorne is with you, Your Grace.  Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?  (DOOR CLOSES)  I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done.  And we will bring peace back to Westeros.  Peace?  Do you think that's what we had under your father?  Or his father? Or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?  He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  You know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon.  - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - GREY WORM: Maj\u00c3\u00ad.  (DOOR OPENS)  You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?  I will see you when I return.  But you don't know when that will be.  No one knows.  I wish you good fortune.  Missandei.  It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.  Why?  You know why.  I don't.  Y-you are my weakness.  That's what I am?  Your weakness?  When Unsullied are young, the masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs,  one boy hates high places,  one is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs  or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest  but I was bravest, always.  - I believe it. - Until  I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.  Now I have fear.  I do, too.  (SNIFFLES)  No.  I want to see you.  Please.  (PANTING)  Might be useful.  Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,  but an excellent researcher.  - Archmaester, I wondered if I - And this one.  Maester Faull was quite the opposite  a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.  Um, I wanted to ask you  If you're going to write histories, Tarly,  you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories,  you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing \"A Chronicle of the Wars  Following the Death of King Robert I\"  so it can sit on a shelf unread.  What? You don't like the title?  What would you call it, then?  Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?  We're not poets, Tarly.  Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.  This is your moment.  Use it wisely.  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases  of advanced greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases  by Archmaester Pylos.  I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos  and his study of rare diseases.  - Oh, you are? - Yes.  And shall I tell you how he died?  From greyscale.  - Oh. - The procedure's far too dangerous,  which is why it's now forbidden.  (CART WHEELS SQUEAKING)  (DOOR OPENS)  Hello.  - What are you doing? - (DOOR CLOSES)  You're Jorah Mormont,  the only son of Jeor Mormont.

Sit down.  Who's that for?  Mm. This is good.  You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.  Mm, I didn't do that.  You've been making pies?  One or two.  I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?  - Big lady? - The lady knight?  You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?  She found me.  What happened to you, Arry?  You got any ale?  (POURING)  - Where you heading? - King's Landing.  - Why? - Heard Cersei's queen now.  Heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  - Boom. - Mm.  I can't believe someone would do that.  Cersei would do that.  I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.  Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.  No, the Boltons are dead.  What?  Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a wildling army  and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King of the North now.  You're lying.  Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother, right?  - Thanks for the pie. - (COINS JINGLING)  Friends don't pay.  Can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.  Thanks.  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed.  Ah, I won't.  I'm like you, Arry.  (SNIFFS) I'm a survivor.  200 miles to King's Landing.  One bottle of rum. You think we'll make it?  (GRUNTS)  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Come in.  A raven, my king, from the Citadel.  JON: This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarly.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch,  a man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone  sits on a mountain of dragonglass.  (ALL MURMURING)  I received this a few days ago  from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.  (ALL MURMURING)  He is now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back  and, if this message is to be believed,  three dragons.  (ALL MURMURING)  JON: Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone  to meet with Daenerys.  And I'm going to accept.  - (ALL SHOUTING) - MAN: Accept?!  We need this dragonglass, my lords!  We know that dragonglass can destroy  both white walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.  But more importantly, we need allies!  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow,  then sail for Dragonstone.  Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing  - and roasted him alive. - I know that.  She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The North is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.  It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him. He's a good man.  Your Grace, with respect, I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted.  - Nor can a Lannister. - ALL: Yeah!  Aye. We called your brother king.  And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.  Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the North.  - MEN: Aye! - (POUNDING TABLES)  You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it.  I never asked for it.  But I accepted it because the North is my home.  It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it,  no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it.  Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.  Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.  You're abandoning your people!  You're abandoning your home.  I'm leaving both in good hands.  - Whose? - Yours.  You are my sister.  You're the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the North is yours.  LITTLEFINGER: I delivered his bones myself.  Presented them to Lady Catelyn  as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  Seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.  I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone,  yet here you stand, King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm.  You don't belong down here.  Forgive me.  We haven't ever talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.  I have nothing to say to you.  Not even \"thank you\"?  If it weren't for me, you'd have been slaughtered on that battlefield.  You have many enemies, my king, but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa,  as I loved her mother.  (GRUNTS)  (CHOKING)  Touch my sister, and I'll kill you myself.

The Mountain killed Father.  He'll crush you with one hand.  Father got careless. That's what Mama says.  Will you shut up about Mama?  \"Mama, Mama, Mama.\"  Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.  And then I won't have to share.  BOTH: \"Mama!\"  How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear,  I'll treat you to a Dornish red.  The best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?  A few times.  Never stayed long.  A boy in every port?  A boy, a girl.

Once I kill my uncle.  And what will you be, handsome?  Whatever my queen commands.  He'll be my advisor, my protector.  Oh, I see.  Your protector.  So, if someone gets too close to you  He might have to intervene.  To hold that person back.  Until they've made their intentions known.  Why are you standing all the way over there, then?

Tyrion plans the conquest of Westeros.  Summary On Dragonstone During a thunderstorm at Dragonstone, Tyrion Lannister, Varys, and Queen Daenerys Targaryen talk about the stormy circumstances of her birth. Varys informs Daenerys that Queen Cersei Lannister's position on Westeros is tenuous. Tyrion counsels her not to burn the Seven Kingdoms and proposes that she forge alliances with the other houses not currently aligned with Cersei. Dany then questions Varys about his previous services to her father the Mad King and King Robert Baratheon. Varys confides that King Robert Baratheon had little interest in ruling but initially appeared to be a definite improvement over Aerys II.  Dany then confronts Varys about his role in hiring the assassins to target her; Varys reminds her that his choices were limited to either feigning continuing loyalty to Robert by arranging the assassination, or refusing and losing his head for it. She distrusts Varys due to his track record of switching allegiances. Refusing to be intimidated, Varys points out that incompetent rulers do not deserve blind loyalty, then recounts his lowly origins as a castrated slave and tells her that his true loyalty lies with the oppressed masses. Varys tells Daenerys that if all she wants from him is blind loyalty, she may as well have him killed, but he is much more useful to her and to the Realm alive, and that he believes she is the last hope for the people. Dany accepts his fealty on the condition that he not conspire against her - instead, she has Varys swear that if he thinks she is failing the people, he'll tell her when she's wrong and be as honest with her as he has been today. Varys agrees. Seemingly satisfied, Daenerys also warns Varys that if he betrays her, she will burn him alive. Varys replies that he would expect nothing less from the \"Mother of Dragons.\"  Daenerys is then visited by the Red Priestess Melisandre, who believes that Dany might be The Prince That Was Promised. Varys questions Melisandre about her previous service to the ill-fated King Stannis Baratheon. While Daenerys initially does not believe that she could be the Prince, Missandei reveals that the High Valyrian word for \"prince\" or \"princess\" is gender neutral. When Daenerys asks Melisandre if she believes the prophecy applies to her, Melisandre replies she believes it could refer to Daenerys or one other: Jon Snow, the King in the North, who has united the North and the Wildlings against a common enemy. Tyrion vouches for Jon Snow and convinces Daenerys that he will make a good ally, given the crimes committed by the Lannisters against his family. Dany accepts Tyrion's advice, and tells him to extend an invitation for Jon to attend her at Dragonstone \u2013 where Jon must \"bend the knee.\"  In the Chamber of the Painted Table, Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand firmly advocate an immediate assault on King's Landing. Tyrion advises against laying waste to the Kingdoms' capital and causing the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents. When Ellaria belittles Tyrion for his lack of stomach for war (despite his previous command and service at the Battle of the Blackwater), Tyrion retorts by deriding Ellaria in that her sole accomplishment to the war effort has been to poison an innocent girl, his niece Myrcella Baratheon, for the sake of petty vengeance against the Lannisters. Ellaria does not deny it and expresses regret that her lover Oberyn Martell died for the cause of Tyrion's freedom. Daenerys ends the argument with a rebuke for Ellaria to respect her Hand. Back to the matter of the invasion, Daenerys insists she doesn't wish to be known as the Queen of the Ashes, to which Olenna Tyrell sarcastically ponders if Daenerys will take the Iron Throne by asking politely. Olenna reminds Daenerys of her granddaughter Margaery Tyrell's fate, a beloved queen who was killed when Cersei blew up the Great Sept of Baelor.  Game-of-thrones-season-7-stormborn-image-6 Daenerys has Tyrion discuss their plan of attack.  Tyrion proposes using a combination of Tyrell and Dornish forces to lay siege to King's Landing, much to the chagrin of Olenna and Ellaria, who balk at the thought of using their own soldiers. Tyrion, however, insists that using the Unsullied and Dothraki would arouse the patriotism of Westerosi bannermen, who would see them as foreign invaders and potentially close ranks behind Cersei. He proposes sending Grey Worm and the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock instead, cutting off Cersei's retreat and dealing a massive blow to the morale of the Western army. In the meantime, the Greyjoy fleet will escort Ellaria back to Sunspear to rally the Dornish forces and then ferry them up the coast to King's Landing, bypassing the Stormlands and allowing the siege to commence early. Daenerys accepts Tyrion's proposal and reminds the others on her council that she will not be attacking King's Landing, and requests consenting approval from everyone, which they give.  Olenna Daenerys Daenerys receives advice from Olenna.  Daenerys dismisses everyone except Lady Olenna. The Dragon Queen tells the Queen of Thorns she is aware that her motives are based on revenge for Cersei and not out of love for Daenerys. Daenerys insists that she will usher in an era of peace. Olenna, however, reflects that there was never a lasting peace under the Mad King, or any preceding Targaryen, for that matter. She tells Daenerys that Tyrion is a clever man but she herself has outlasted many clever men by not listening to their advice. Olenna says the lords of Westeros are sheep but Daenerys is not a sheep. She counsels Daenerys that if she's to rule Westeros, \"You're a dragon. Be a dragon.\"  Later, Missandei visits Grey Worm to bid him farewell before his departure to Casterly Rock. Grey Worm confides that Missandei is his weakness, and when she expresses confusion, he tells her that the Good Masters of Astapor tortured the Unsullied by exposing them to their worst fears. For example, a fear of dogs led to being made to sleep with dogs, a fear of heights means climbing a cliff. If the young boy was afraid of drowning, he'd be thrown into the sea. If he drowns, it would be \"good\", and if he learns to swim, it would be \"good\" because only the fit survive. Grey Worm recalls that he was never the biggest/fastest/strongest but he was the most fearless warrior until he met Missandei. She replies that she also has to deal with fear and kisses him. Missandei strips naked and proceeds to undress Grey Worm. Grey Worm is reluctant to remove his trousers (presumably not wanting to horrify her with his castration scars) but eventually acquiesces to Missandei's wishes. The two of them then share an intimate sexual encounter.  In King's Landing In the throne room of the Red Keep, Queen Cersei Lannister gives a speech urging several nobles from the Reach, including Lord Randyll Tarly, to reaffirm their allegiance to the Iron Throne and not follow House Tyrell in supporting Daenerys. Cersei warns that the Targaryen's Dothraki and Unsullied hordes would pillage their lands and homes, and rape their women. When Lord Tarly points out that Daenerys has three dragons, Maester Qyburn replies that he is \"at work on a solution\".  Following the audience with Queen Cersei, Lord Tarly meets in private with Jaime Lannister, who wants to appoint him as his general. Tarly is unwilling to break his fealty to Lady Olenna Tyrell and is wary of the Lannisters, who \"cut [their rivals'] throats at weddings\". Jaime reminds Tarly that he also swore an oath to the Iron Throne, and tells him that Cersei is preferable to Daenerys and her foreign armies. Jaime also promises that Cersei will make Tarly the new Warden of the South.  Cersei Stormborn ep Cersei visits the skull of Balerion the Black Dread.  Later, Qyburn leads Cersei to the dragon skulls beneath the Red Keep. He tells Cersei that his spies have reported that one of Daenerys' dragons was wounded by a spear at Meereen, showing that the dragons are not invincible. Qyburn then displays a scorpion, a long-range artillery weapon, and reassures her that they can hurt dragons. He has her test the scorpion on the nearby skull of Balerion the Black Dread (the dragon of Aegon the Conqueror) and she is pleased when the bolt pierces through the massive, hard skull. At Winterfell At Winterfell, Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Davos Seaworth discuss the letter they received from Tyrion. Jon asks for Sansa's opinion and while Sansa remembers that Tyrion was kind to her and was unlike the rest of his family, she wonders if the message is truly from Tyrion. Jon confirms the letter's authenticity as it ends with the line \"For all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers' eyes,\" which is what Tyrion told Jon when they first met. Even so, Sansa worries it is too big a risk and Jon concedes that now is not the right time to go to Dragonstone. Davos opines that Dany will make a good ally in the war to come against the White Walkers; Jon himself told him that wights are killed by fire, and what creatures just happen to breathe fire?  Some days later, Maester Wolkan brings Jon Snow a message from Samwell Tarly in the Citadel. Jon gathers the Northern lords in the main hall and announces that Sam's letter reveals there is a vein of dragonglass beneath Dragonstone. He adds that Lord Tyrion has invited him to Dragonstone to meet with Queen Daenerys and announces his decision to travel to Dragonstone to convince Daenerys to join their fight against the White Walkers, declaring that he plans to travel with Davos to White Harbor and sail to Dragonstone island. Lords Yohn Royce and Robett Glover voice their opinions that a Targaryen cannot be trusted, citing the atrocities committed by Daenerys's father. Lady Lyanna Mormont urges the King in the North to stay at home. Jon accepts that he is taking a risk but stresses that the fight against the White Walkers is more important, and they need Daenerys' aid if the North is to be saved. Jon emphasizes that the North is his home, it is part of him, and he will never stop fighting for it. Sansa reiterates her objection to Jon's leaving, and Jon tells Sansa that he is appointing her as ruler of the North in his absence as she is his sister, regent, and a Stark. Sansa accepts.  Jon and Petyr in Stormborn Petyr admits his love for Sansa.  In the catacombs beneath Winterfell, Petyr Baelish finds Jon Snow, who is visiting his father's tomb, and vouches that Tyrion can be trusted. Petyr tells Jon that while he and Eddard had their differences, they both loved Catelyn Stark. He notes Catelyn wasn't fond of Jon, and muses that perhaps Catelyn underestimated Jon's potential as Jon now stands as the North's best chance against the coming storm. When Jon, who clearly distrusts Baelish, says that Petyr shouldn't be there and that they have nothing to say to each other, Baelish replies that Jon should be grateful to him for saving him from death at the hands of Ramsay Bolton. Baelish insists he is not Jon's enemy. He tells Jon that he loves Sansa, as he loved Sansa's mother; a disgusted Jon, angered by this, lashes out and seizes Baelish by the throat, slamming him into a wall. He tells Baelish, \"Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.\" Outside, Jon, Davos, and several horsemen then prepare to ride south to White Harbor while Sansa watches from the castle battlements. Before Jon leaves, he and Sansa bid each other farewell. Petyr, emerging from the catacombs, gazes at Sansa.  In the Riverlands Arya Stark encounters Hot Pie at the Inn at the Crossroads, accosting him to give her some pie and ale. Hot Pie tells her that he has become a seasoned pie-master, and Arya mentions that she has had some experience baking two pies (omitting the fact that she served Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers to their father, the late Lord Walder Frey). When Hot Pie asks Arya if the lady knight Brienne of Tarth had found her, Arya gives an affirmative answer. When Hot Pie asks where she is traveling to, Arya replies that she is traveling to King's Landing for the Queen. Hot Pie tells her that Queen Cersei has blown up the Great Sept of Baelor and wonders why she is not heading to Winterfell.  Stormborn Arya City Arya chooses home over Cersei.  Arya replies that the Boltons occupy the castle, but Hot Pie informs her that the Boltons are now dead, killed during the Battle of the Bastards by her half-brother Jon Snow, who has been named King in the North. Arya decides to head north, and Hot Pie tells her not to worry about paying for the cost of the meal since she is a friend. As she leaves, Hot Pie remarks that Arya is pretty for someone whom he thought was a boy. Arya rides her horse into the frost-covered forest.  Later, as Arya prepares to set up camp in a snowy, forested area, her horse is startled by several wolves. Before the wolves can attack her, they are silenced by their pack leader, which turns out to be Arya's direwolf Nymeria. Nymeria is initially apprehensive towards Arya but soon recognizes her former mistress. Arya tells her direwolf that she is going home and invites her to come with her. However, Nymeria turns and leaves with the pack. Arya watches in sadness and remarks, \"That's not you.\"  In Oldtown At the Citadel, Archmaester Ebrose and Samwell Tarly examine Jorah Mormont, whose greyscale has spread to his torso. The Archmaester tells Jorah that he should have cut off his lower arm instead of letting the infection spread. Ebrose states that Mormont is beyond saving. While it is customary for infected smallfolk to be sent to live with the stone men, Ebrose gives Mormont one more day, implying with a look at his sword that the anointed knight could choose to commit suicide instead. When Sam asks about sending condolences to Jorah's family at House Mormont, Jorah replies that he is estranged from his family.  Sam helps Jorah Stormborn Sam sneaks in and attempts to save Jorah from greyscale.  Later, the Archmaester lectures Tarly about the art of writing history. Sam refuses to give up on Jorah and mentions that a previous Maester, Pylos, successfully treated two cases of advanced greyscale. Ebrose responds that Pylos contracted the disease himself and died of it; because of the risk, the procedure was declared forbidden.  Undaunted, Sam decides to treat Jorah and secretly visits his quarters after dark. He tells Jorah, \"You're not dying today,\" reveals himself to be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, that he served under Jorah's father, the late Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and was present when he died. Sam gives Jorah rum to drink after taking a fortifying swig himself, telling him that the process will be painful. Sam also provides Jorah with a thick strip of leather as a mouthguard so he can focus on biting down on it to help muffle his screams, as he explains that he's performing the procedure without permission. Sam's plan involves using a scalpel to separate and cut away Jorah's infected skin and then applying a medicinal herbal ointment plaster to the exposed layer, though Jorah gives him a look that tells Sam he shouldn't bother trying to explain it to him. Despite experiencing the pain of having a large patch of greyscale skin debrided, Jorah nods his consent for Sam to continue the debridement.  On the Narrow Sea Yara and Theon Look Up at Euron Yara and Ellaria's ships are attacked by Euron.  On the Narrow Sea, Yara Greyjoy and her brother Theon Greyjoy travel aboard their portion of the Iron Fleet with their Dornish allies Ellaria Sand, her daughter Tyene, and Tyene's half-sisters Obara and Nymeria Sand. In their quarters, the Sand Snakes are lying in bed and argue about killing Lannisters. Elsewhere, Ellaria drinks Ironborn liquor with Yara and Theon, which she compares unfavorably to Dornish wine. Ellaria asks Yara if she had ever been to Dorne, to which Yara responds that she has been there a few times. Ellaria responds that there is a boy in every port in Dorne and Yara tells her, \"A boy, a girl. Depends on the port.\" As they begin to flirt with one another and Ellaria motions for Theon to get her more wine, Yara explains Theon is not a servant but will be both her advisor and protector once she's killed her uncle. Yara puts her feet up on the table. Ellaria bends over Yara and spreads her legs apart across the table. Ellaria moves her hand up Yara's leg towards her crotch. Ellaria invites Theon to have a threesome with her and Yara, but Yara tells Ellaria, \"Leave him be.\" While Yara and Ellaria began kissing, Yara's ship is struck. On the deck above, they discover that their fleet has been ambushed by Euron Greyjoy's portion of the Iron Fleet.  Euron's flagship Silence rams Yara's ship and lands a boarding party, Euron at the forefront of the attack. Yara and her men fight fiercely but are overwhelmed by Euron's warriors. Tyene retreats below decks to protect her mother Ellaria on Yara's orders, while Obara and Nymeria fight against Euron's Ironborn. Obara fights Euron, who kills her by impaling her with her own spear. Nymeria attacks him with her whip but Euron strangles her to death with it. Though Tyene kills several Ironborn, she and Ellaria are overwhelmed. Ellaria tells the Ironborn to kill them quickly, but they are taken captive instead.  Euron-Yara-Stormborn Euron holds Yara hostage.  Yara and Euron fight with axes as Yara's fleet burns in the night. Euron captures Yara and then goads \"little Theon\" to come save her. Theon is about to come to his sister's aid but panics when Euron's men begin mutilating the wounded sailors, reminding him of the tortures he suffered at Ramsay Bolton's hands. To Yara's dismay, Theon jumps overboard while Euron laughs with cruel glee. Theon clings to driftwood and sees Obara and Nymeria's corpses impaled on and hanged by the neck from the prow, respectively. Euron's fleet starts sailing towards King's Landing as Yara's fleet burns in the Narrow Sea, while Theon watches helplessly as the ship carrying his sister disappears into the night."], "review": ["\u2018Stormborn\u2019, more than any episode in recent memory, puts the politics front and center and justifies why the show is called \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d.Say No to Immigrants!This week on Thrones, Cersei launches a post-truth, alt-facts offensive that would have even the US President taking note(s). Aside from branding Dany as evil, Cersei implores her liege lords to prevent mindless, foreign savages from stealing jobs that rightfully belong to them \u2014 like destroying households and raping women.Jaime\u2019s lighter touch seems to sway Randall Tarly later, but every time Jaime uses his wiles now, I start praying that it doesn\u2019t cost him another arm.The scene where Qyburn and Cersei survey the old dragon skulls was hair-raising, until it wasn\u2019t. Seldom has a lack of spending on Defense R&D been as apparent as when Qyburn demonstrates his latest, state-of-the-art weapon \u2014 Joffrey\u2019s Crossbow 6S.Why settle for Sexposition, when you can have both, separately?We are effectively served up a \u201cThis Week, That Year\u201d Thrones refresher in the opening scenes, but the episode leverages this to deftly demonstrate the motivations of (and dynamics between) the various players \u2014 Daenerys, Varys, Tyrion and later Melisandre.I liked how Dany maneuvers the conversation \u2014 she wants to inspire loyalty, but realizes that the most useful thing she can ask of Varys is his honesty. Melisandre\u2019s much-predicted arrival in Dragonstone also offers a big hurrah moment for fans of Daenerys and advocates of gender-neutral titles alike.Tyrion proves his worth tenfold this episode, first filtering out phrases that would have resulted in Dany\u2019s mail landing in Jon\u2019s spam folder, and then seemingly crafting the perfect strategy to preempt Cersei\u2019s plan (more on this later). The ever-prickly Lady Olenna however issues a countermand to Dany, and for the second episode in a row, it isn\u2019t obvious as to who is suggesting the right course of action.A rare traditional sex scene (albeit one with neither pillar nor stones) might have sounded the death knell for Greyworm, who having expressed his love to Missandei, will most likely help Dany capture Casterly Rock, but die in the battle. I wager that Jorah, having been sullied but cured by Maester Samwell, will take up his spot in Dany\u2019s ranks.The King Not in the NorthFollowing the insipid years under Stannis, Dragonstone is in dire need of a PR facelift to revive tourist interest. Thankfully, the trio of Sam, Melisandre and Tyrion craft a campaign so good that even Northern Kings can\u2019t help but take a leaf out of Greyworm\u2019s playbook and venture down south.It\u2019s good to see that the friction between Sansa and Jon wasn\u2019t a throwaway moment, as this episode builds on it even more. The show is making it harder than usual for Baelish to leverage this tension to his advantage however, with Jon channeling Season 1 Ned by putting his little neck in a stranglehold. Now that Arya\u2019s all set to arrive back home, things are only going to get tougher for Baelish. Which begs the question \u2014 has Westeros\u2019 Chief P.I.M.P forgotten how to hustle?Hello, Old FriendWith his ability to distill information into succinct messages, Hot Pie might have an alternative career lying in store as a news writer for Inshorts. There is a tragic quality to his interaction with Arya, with Arya\u2019s inability to treat him with decency and warmth depicting her loss of innocence more potently than a hundred scenes of her killing men in cold blood.Arya reunites briefly with yet another old friend, but quickly learns that time and Nymeria wait for none. I loved this scene, and suggest you read Deepak Mehta\u2019s awesome answer about it.Actions that Reek of CowardiceB-movie mad man Euron Greyjoy seems to be in possession of Captain Jack Sparrow\u2019s compass, as his pirate armada expertly intercepts Yara\u2019s fleet and ruins Tyrion\u2019s plans. An admittedly tense battle ensues, and following one final bit of terrible Sand Snake dialogue, two of them get sacrificed to the God of Plot-Advancement. The show does a good feint here, as Ellaria and her daughter (whom I\u2019d thought would die) are kept alive presumably as dowry for Queen Cersei.Amidst the carnage, we witness Theon regress into Reek as he abandons ship and lives to fight another day.I could do with a couple of more episodes like this, before we see the Night King again.", "Our pre-show warning from the Voice of Sky Atlantic:\u2018\u2026with scenes of a sexual nature\u2026Greyjoy and pain\u2026it\u2019s Game of Thrones!\u2019Roll opening credits and cut to scenes of a Donner und Blitzen nature.Meanwhile, on Dragonstone\u2026We have a war council - Varys does his Man of the People routine, whilst Dany notes that the price of betrayal is a damn good burning - and fails to hide her glee at the possibility that she might get to dish out some fiery justice to someone, anyone.Days since she last burned someone alive?Far too many.Tyrion the Good spends his time like a stuck record reminding Dany that \u2018no, remember how we agreed that you weren\u2019t going to burn them all - not even a little bit - not even just the feet of all your subjects - nobody\u2019s doing any burning, how many times do I have to say NO BURNING?\u2019Tyrion the Good recalls that Jon Snow is a good bloke. They should write to Jon because Tyrion has met Jon and Tyrion likes Jon, so they do.If you missed that bit, don\u2019t worry, it will be spelt out painfully again at Winterfell because Jon has met Tyrion and recalls that Tyrion is a good bloke.They really did get on rather well - probably because they are both good blokes.In other news, a plan is put together to attack Casterley Rock, give the Dornish a lift home, and use the Westerosi armies to lay siege to King\u2019s Landing, thus giving the intended starvation of a smallfolk that personal touch.The Dothraki will\u2026.where are the Dothraki?You know how it is - you bring a horde of Dothraki home, put them somewhere, and you\u2019re buggered if you can remember where you put them? Where did you last see them? Dunno. You retrace your steps to try to figure out where you would have put them, but they\u2019re not there! Someone moved the Dothraki! Who moved the Dothraki? People never put things away in the right place. God, it\u2019s so annoying.It is instructive that Tommy Lee of the \u201cMotley Crue\u201d actually ended up in jail after losing his temper because he could not find the pan he needed in his own kitchen.The Dothraki are Tommy Lee\u2019s pan, and Dragonstone, his kitchen.In King\u2019s Landing\u2026Cersei gathers the Southren Lords she hasn\u2019t got round to burning to charm them into fighting for her against The Dragon Queen. Cersei the Pot calls out the Dany KettleBlack: look here Southren Lords, you don\u2019t want a Queen who burns people do you? Or subjects them to cruel and unusual punishment?Qyburn has been working on the Dragonkiller 3000 for her.Take that Balerion the Black Dread!Somewhere in the Riverlands\u2026Arya is about to have her own Lassie moment with Nymeria.What\u2019s that Greywind? The Kingslayer\u2019s stuck down the old goat track?Whatever Arya is thinking, Nymeria clearly thinks it a bad idea.Renowned Centre of Learning, the Citadel\u2026\u2026finds Samwell Tarly talking Greyscale with Maester JimBroadbent.Horace Slughorn is very sorry, but Greyscale cannot be cured - it\u2019s against the rules, dammit - so, if Sam wants to cure Greyscale, there\u2019ll be no playing it by the book. and he\u2019ll have to go rogue.Not only that, he\u2019s on borrowed time. Patients with Greyscale get shipped to Valyria to be with the Stone Men - Jorah should have already have been couriered, but because he is a Noble Man, he gets One More Day.Wait.Valyria is one of the big mysteries of ASOIAF.Nobody sails to Valyria and survives ( - BookEuron might have, but then he does have a tendency to boast and make things up). Valyria is unknown.But thanks to an off-hand, casual comment, we now know that Valyria is actually a retirement home for people with a disease that the Citadel can\u2019t be arsed to do any research on. There\u2019s probably no money in it.The Citadel are shipping people to Valyria all the time. No problem.Gerion Lannister is likely working as a dinner lady there.Winterfell - and another power point presentation by Jon\u2026Jon\u2019s TED talks have such clunky dialogue that it actually hurts my teeth.He is like a primary school teacher at carpet time.What do we need to do to defeat the Army of the Dead?That\u2019s right - we need fire.Ah, but what also has fire besides a fire?Yes, yes, you with your hand up -yes, dragons - well done!But there\u2019s something else - this is a bit harder - what has fire, but looks like it doesn\u2019t have fire?That\u2019s right!

Pro-tip: those Starks are prickly about their honour. Admire my own cunning, quietly.Assure Jon about my intentions re. Sansa, by explaining that I had wanted to bang - no, not bang - loved her mother, but unfortunately she\u2019s dead in the show, and a re-animated corpse with an attitude problem and fingernail raked face in the books. You just wouldn\u2019t, would you? Jon therefore owes me one Sansa.Share manly bro-ment now that Jon understands that I am not a creepy middle-aged man lurking after his teenage sister. Creepy lurkers don\u2019t fixate on young girls for good reasons, like the ones I have.Admire my own cunning, quietly. Allow a knowing smirk.How it actually went:On one of the Fourteen Seas\u2026All is calm. All is bright.Yara\u2019s below decks touching up Ellaria - the reaction of the male in our house was to laugh and say \u2018oh, please\u2019 in a disparaging manner, rather than the \u2018oh, there might be some hot girl on girl action here\u2019 look the show must have been going for, since there was no other reason for that shit.You know when you\u2019re a kid, that there\u2019s always that uncle?The one who chases the kids round the garden, plays all the stupid games, gets them to fire water pistols at Grandma - kids love him, right? - he\u2019s so much fun.But he always goes that bit too far.The kids are laughing, they\u2019re happy, they\u2019re happy\u2026oh no, now they\u2019re all crying\u2026and your mum gives Fun Uncle a really good telling off.I think we all remember that time we were below decks with a Dornish character ruined by the show, about to get a bit\u2026well, never mind\u2026and there was a tremendous banging, but it was coming from outside?We ran up the stairs with our traumatised brother - missing several bodily parts - to see what all the commotion was about! What could it be?Typical.It was fun uncle Euron lowering a gang plank and shouting \u2018Raaaahhhhh!\u2019 as he charged towards us with his axe, whilst his daft mates set fire to everything!What is he like?Uncle Euron played with all the children on the boat - especially the two little Dornish girls - then, he did that thing where he pulls a funny face, pretends he\u2019s crazy, going \u2018give your uncle a kiss!\u2019 He even pushed our brother in the sea without using his hands! How we laughed.Then we all went home for tea. The End.", "I liked it better than the 1st episode. The first episode was basically a recap, 'previously on GoT'.It is worth mentioning there are parts I still disliked and found illogical.Storms and rain in Dragonstone. How fitting for 'the Stormborn' to be ruling there. Maybe, the gods of Westeros wept when Dany was born and they are weeping now that she has returned. Is this symbolic of Dany bringing chaos and storm? Dany suggests 'it still doesn't feel like home'. Ok, I knew she would complain. Dragonstone is supposed to have lovely 'red doors'. I guess she doesn't like this shade of red. I can imagin her sitting the iron throne and complaining of the cold steel.Finally, the show has decided to address some plot holes. Dany approaches Varys on the assassination attempt. They were waiting for the cameras. A possible 3-6 month boat journey from Slavers Bay to Dragonstone was spent in silence. Now, Dany is addressing the issue. Varys stands his ground. Rightly so. Dany had a bone to pick. And they both got what they wanted. This does leave the door open to Varys leaving Dany's side if she goes batshit and starts burning everything with her dragons. Dany threatens another person with 'I will burn you alive'. Gee, I wonder who has said that before? The Mad King!The war council has Tyrion and Ellaria addressing another lingering issue. Myrcella's death. Tyrion growls a bit and then lets it go. This is just not on. This is not the real Tyrion. He loved Myrcella and Tommen. He loves Jaime. He wouldn't let the death of his niece go with a sideways look. But now he has. So fuck you, show Tyrion. Really. I wonder how he will deal with Olenna when he finds out she framed him for murder. I am betting on a frown and a hiss, but no more.A decent plan is made to address the Dothraki issue. No one likes them in Westeros. So Dany is sending the Tyrells and Dornish to perish in KL. Tyrion correctly wants to attack the Lannister home base. From the trailers, it is obvious that the Unsullied sneak in through some cave like structure in the Rock, and succeed in the opening the castle doors to their comrads. I am not sure if they will use the pretext of Tyrion's knowledge with drains or have created a random hole in the Rock's wall. You know, easy access for enemy invaders.Greyworm announces the visitor. It had to be Mel. She has decided Dany has a part to play. Did she see this in her fires too? Has she been seeing more visions sent from R'hllor? That guy could make it easier and send it all at once to Mel. Dany eats up the part about her being a possible saviour and asks for another bowl. Mel conveniently leaves out that Jon Snow is more than a man. He has risen back from the dead. Tyrion responds positively to Jon Snow. No one mentions that Sansa is ruling beside Jon, or that she is with her brother. I would like to see Tyrion's reaction to Sansa. Dany demands that Jon bend the knee to her (I will forever hate Jon if he does so). Because she is somehow more rightful to these lands compared to a man whose house has dwelt within Westeros for over 8000years. And is an elected and loved king.Olenna chats with Dany. She encourages Dany to use her dragons. Which I am sure Dany will in the next episode against Jaime and the Lannister army when invading Casterly Rock.Winterfell! Finally, the leaders are discussing the issues at hand BEFORE they go in front of all the lords and bannermen. Unlike last week. The language in Tyrion's letter is interesting and VERY different to what Dany commanded. Does Tyrion think a softer tone helps lure Jon south and then have him forced to bend the knee? Or, does he think he can convince Dany to treat Jon as an equal? Jon responds positively to Tyrion's letter. Specially, after reading their personal little anecdot. Sansa is right in suggesting to be careful. Every Stark who has ridden south lately has died. Jon will be the first to come back alive, I think. He will also be very surprised to see he has been commanded to bend the knee and not treat with Dany.Cersei! I respect this conniving woman far more than Dany. Both in the books and the show. She goes for what she wants. She gets down and dirty and suffers the good with the bad. She lays out all the shit Dany has been getting up to in Essos. The foreign legions she has brought who are savages. And she is right. Despite Dany's intentions, mass scale crucifixion and burnings are not a sign of love and wisdom from a monarch. Cersei demands assistance from the Reach lords headed by Randyll. Jaime rightly suspects Randyll might not assist them. He reminds Randyll that an oath to the crown supercedes the oath to the liege lord. Randyll seems stern, loyal and strong. But he must have ambitions too. Jaime offers him dominion over all of the Reach which is a pretty handsom offer. Dickon has grown immensely since last season. What does he put in his water?Oldtown! Here we have the real heir to house Botlon. Samwell Bolton, Sam the Slayer, now also Sam the Flayer. How is Jorah surviving this technique? Will he grow normal skin underneath? Won't a full body flaying crack and fester? Does it not lead to death? So many unanswered questions. But Jorah is cured. So yippee. Sam's actions and questioning of the lead maesters may have him kicked out. Or he will probably join Jorah to go to Dragonstone and convince Dany of the threat of the White walkers. Sam is networking. He is building connection with both the north and the south. His whole plot in the Citadel is a waste. He is curing greyscale which won't even spread in Westeron on the show. He is doing nothing. We knew about dragonglass two seasons ago. I miss Stannis.Arya! This is my favorite bit of the episode. Yes, it is an average part. But Arya finally decides to go north!!! The moment Hot Pie told her that Jon Snow is king in the north, and Arya had a shocked look, I got goosebumps. I can't believe Arya didn't know anything of the north even though she has been roaming the Riverlands killing the Freys. News gets around. But she didn't know. Good on you, Hot Pie!!! He thinks Arya is pretty. Cool. She has the Ned Stark hairstyle. I knew she would go north despite her hesitation.Qyburn! I guess the dragonskulls have a different purpose in the books. On the show, they get crushed by a bolt. Something that Cersei and every other educated person in Westeros should have known. Meraxes died that way almost 300years ago. When Cersei suggested that a plan against the dragons is being hatched, I assumed Qyburn had some form of magic. But it is a bolt. A bit obvious. Bolts kill flying creatures. I am betting on Viserion to go down first.Greyworm and Missandei. First set of boobs in season 7. Oh look, we get Greyworm's butt as a bonus. For a eunuch with no sex education or experience, he seems to know what he is doing. And he is good at it!! Modern humans must suck big time to go through sex ed and still be mediocre at sex the first time. Why did the show think this scene is more important than...let's say....hm, I don't know....a person who can control the fate of fucking world, Bran!!!! Too bad you can't fast forward these scenes.Another raven at Winterfell from Sam. Great information, fatboy. You got to do more than to earn your shit-food at the Citadel. Jon is very quick to jump on board for any sort of information or alliance he can get against the White walkers. He is too hasty. Which is not like Jon. Something has to blow up in his face sooner than later.Jon argues with the bannermen and leaves them more antagonized than ever. This has to lead to something. Jon claims he was elected and is doing the right thing. But the lords don't seem convinced.Sit down, Lyanna Mormont! Bear Island is not large, nor influential enough to have you constantly standing up shouting. You are right in this instance. But where are the types of big northern lords who fought each other on who should lead Robb's van? We have a Glover. And then Mormont. What happend to the skinny dude who was passed for a Cerwyn. Manderly, anyone?Jon leaves Sansa in control. Good choice. Logical choice. She is the only other Stark in Winterfell. She is a bit more ruthless, a bit more cautious, which is what the north prefers. I think Sansa won this episode's battle of logic with Jon. She seems wary and careful. With reason! Brienne has a little smile on her face. Meh! Everyone you protect dies or gets maimed, girl. Let's see how you can protect Sansa.Contrary to what most people predicted, I knew Baelish wouldn't reveal Jon's parentage. This is Baelish's monologue from the second trailer. The 'king in the north' part was cut in the trailer making everyone think this speech was directed at Sansa. I called it to be something about Sansa. And it is. Jon slams him against the wall. Ned's likeness watches the same thing he did once, in silence. LF is right that he was never thanked for his assistance. Sansa and Jon are pissing on him for the help he provided. He at least deserves that recognition. Baelish loosening his neck muscles. I hope he twists some webs and causes a bit of chaos. I am getting bored of this new loser Baelish stalking Sansa and being creepy.Arya meets Nymeria. Nothing to worry about. Nymeria will follow Arya. It was strongly implied that Nymeria recognized her. Otherwise a direwolf and her savage pack would have ripped a human apart. Nymeria will probably wait till Arya is in danger and then run to the rescue. Or follow her till she does go to Winterfell. There was a wolf pack. It symbolized that the Starks will all unite in Winterfell. That is when Ghost and Nymeria will join them as well.Greyjoy fleet. Floating. Sandbrats in the deck below. Momma, momma, momma. Once again, why is this part necessary more than Bran? Then, we have randy Ellaria deploying for a foreign invasion. Thank god for show Euron. Never thought I would say that about him. He arrives. He has a bit of Victarion in him the way he fights. He kicks the shit out the Sandbrats. More goosebumps for me. He impaled Obarra on her own spear and hang Nymeria with her own whip. Freaking awesom!!!! And then he got Yarra. Theon regressed to his fearful state due to PTSD. He flees and he will be the one who gets the message to Dany in Dragonstone. How did Tyene hold off large men wielding long swords coming at her with a knife? Whatever, she is caught now. Yay! Thank you, show Euron!Overall, I liked the episode better than the first one. Things got moving. Dany showed more of her true colours which we have come to expect. Cersei was right and cunning. Jon was un-Jon like and hasty whilst Sansa was cautious and clever. Dany got defeated in one battle at least. Which is quite satisfying. I wonder what she will do now to mobilize her armies. Her fleet is gone. So if the Unsullied and the Dothraki make it to the shores of Westeros, it should be a miracle. The Ironborn did not have that many spare ships to leave too many behind in Dragonstone. She will probably start burning shit now in her rage. Thank you for adding fuel to the fire, Olenna.I expect Jon to be welcomed into a very different scene in Dragonstone compared to what he expected from Tyrion's letter. Baelish will cause a rift between Sansa and Jon, the lords should side with Sansa over Jon considering what Jon is doing at the moment. I think Tyrion may play referee between Jon and Dany. He may propose a marriage. Between Jon and Dany. Though, I hope not. It would be nice to get Davos, Mel, Dany, Jon and Tyrion in one room going at each other. Davos should call out Mel for burning people. Dany will scold Mel. Which is rich considering she burns people or always threatens to. A mention of Sansa should come up too. How will Tyrion deal with his wife? Non-wife? Ex-wife?I liked Arya turning north. Nymeria recognized her and will definitely follow. I wonder if she will run into the Hound and BwB again on the way to the north. I am 99% sure that the Hound will reveal Baelish's betrayal to the girls.I loved the death of the Sandbrats. I predicted that Yarra will be a gift for Cersei. And she will be. I hope Cerei unleashes Gregor on Tyene. And then send her in pieces to Dany and Tyrion.Sam's part is very disappointing. He is adding nothing to the story and plot. Where the hell is Bran? He is one of the most important characters in the books, maybe as much as Jon. But he is missing. Most of the show is revolving around Jon, Dany and Cersei. As expected since one is the villain whilst the other two are fan favorites. With snippets of Sam. I can't believe the show is making Tyrion look past the murder of Myrcella. Book Tyrion would scheme and have Ellaria burnt by a dragon.Episode 3 should follow the same path. A war between the Unsullied and the Lannisters in the west. Casterly Rock may fall whilst all the Lannister army gets burnt by Drogon. I think this is where we will see Jaime riding with a spear through the burning field. Once again, where is Bran?", "(Spoilers Galore) This was an uneven episode, ranging from some well done scenes to necessary events to why in God\u2019s name do we have to watch this part. Let\u2019s start with the sections that worked well and work our way downward:BestSam and Jorah: I didn\u2019t expect to like this as much as I did. It does seem rather convenient for Jorah to get healed of greyscale when others have died in droves. Since I knew that Jorah was going to join Daenerys later on from leaked photos, I didn\u2019t expect it to be interesting, but it was. Sam knew Jorah\u2019s name from his father, Jeor. He respected Jeor and mourned his death. Saving Gilly from the Nights Watch brothers who mutinied, brought out the best in Sam, as he found the courage to protect Gilly and the baby by killing a White Walker. In this scene, he decides that Jorah Mormont will not die. So he puts him through an agonizing healing session that makes a spinal tap look like cotton candy. Yes, it was gross, but it made sense that Sam would find a way to heal Jorah. This may earn him his maester chain quicker, and gain the respect of Archmaster Embrose or he may get tossed out without his chain, but ready to join Jon anyway. (I would like for Sam to complete his training, but it may not happen.) It also may help Jon Snow who is on his way to see Daenerys. Once she finds out that Jon\u2019s best friend healed her loyal friend, she may feel more inclined to listen to Jon\u2019s conditions. I bet we find Jorah healthy and ready to kick some Lannister behind very soon. Even though I knew I was emotionally manipulated, I liked this part of the show\u2014I did.GoodArya: She meets Hot Pie and Nymeria. So it wasn\u2019t all that complicated. All she needed to hear from Hot Pie that Jon Snow is now the King in the North and the Boltons are dead. Poof. She will now go North. Maybe Hot Pie is Azor Ahai. The meeting with Nymeria and her pack was superb. Her dire wolf has grown. Will the pack follow Arya to the North? (I say yes.) Does she turn away from Arya because her main responsibility is her pack, just as Arya is now responsible to help Sansa rule the North in Jon\u2019s stead? I think we will see Nymeria again, and that is a good thing for the Starks as we have yet to see Ghost, plus we need to see their animal representation as much as we see Dany\u2019s dragons. I expect a huge homecoming in Winterfell soon of remaining Stark humans and direwolves, along with supporters.Kings Landing: Cersei brought the lords from the Reach, and tried to scare them into obedience with tales from the dark side of the Mad King\u2019s daughter(and she did crucify the masters, so let\u2019s not pretend otherwise.) Will Randyll Tarly betray his oath to House Tyrell and fight with Cersei against Daenarys? Jaime tried to tempt him with a promise to be Warden of the South as well as a ranking general. Randyll listened, but spoke of his oath, reminding Jaime that he is a Tarly and that name means something. I cannot help but like this guy with his gruff justice and determined duty. I really want to know what he is going to do. My guess is that he will join Jaime in fighting the Tyrell army, but he will realize that he cannot go through with it. Then he will fight with the Tyrells, and this is where Dickon may die and Randyll feels he has lost everything that matters. Then he will join Daenerys Targaryen. I may be wrong, but I just don\u2019t see this guy sticking it out with Cersei. He may influence Jaime to get with the program, even though I expect Jaime to stay with Cersei all season.Winterfell: As long as I have to see Littlefinger slithering his way along the paths of the North, I won\u2019t be completely happy with the otherwise good depiction of the North. Jon has made it clear that he did not want to be king, but he will do the best he can, even if the lords and ladies of the North don\u2019t agree with his decision. Jon is at his best in \u201cStormborn\u201d as he is thinking of the future, not his popularity. He vouches for Sam, who tells him of the dragonstone, and tells everyone that Tyrion is a good man. Okay. The show has made it clear that Tyrion is a good guy, and we shall not forget. So he and Davos will meet Daenerys, and try to get her support to fight the White Walkers. Will she ask him to bend the knee? Will he relive the agony of Torrhen Stark, who knelt before the Conqueror to avoid a bloodbath? Jon may agree to bend the knee in exchange for some White Walker support\u2014maybe a dragon or two, but please, keep the Dothraki\u2014we prefer Unsullied. I\u2019m not looking forward to this meeting, but I suspect it will tell us a lot about Daenerys and whether she deserves to be considered Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Jon will probably come off a lot better. And no, I don\u2019t think he is walking into a trap. However, Littlefinger had to make his intentions toward Sansa clear to Jon. (I love your sister so much that I made her marry a raping sadist.) Lord Baelish, your arc in this show has ended.FairDragonstone: I liked the look of the small council meeting, Olenna got all the good lines. Tyrion is the voice of reason, urging Daenerys to remember that she will not be a queen of ashes. Call me paranoid, but I felt I was seeing a lot of foreshadowing at Dragonstone. First, Daenerys takes issue with Varys, saying that he was loyal to Robert and really backed her brother, who was weak and stupid. She tells Varys that he had no problem betraying the Lannisters when it suited him, so how can she trust him? Well, Dany, you have a Hand of the King who killed his father. Ellaria and her brood killed their anointed prince. Really, you just aren\u2019t attracting the 1%. Varys told her that he was not born to a noble family (read: I am not a Blackfyre). He serves the people because that is what he is\u2014a former slave who had to suffer under despots. Dany makes him promise that he will not go behind her back, that he will confront her with her weaknesses if he feels the need to betray her. Hmmm. Does this mean that Varys will dump Daenerys sometime in, ah, Season 8? Is Dany\u2019s distrust the beginning of a paranoid episode? Is this a sign that she will soon trust no one? Will she go the way of Aerys II? She spent a boat ride keeping all of this to herself. Only Yara and Tyrion made sense: Yara was right to say that they should attack King\u2019s Landing as they will be regrouping while Daenerys comes in full force. Good advice, but Dany decided that Olenna should go to Highgarden and Ellaria and company must go back to Dorne. That was not smart. Tyrion was right to make sure Daenerys doesn\u2019t get too angry with Varys as it was an odd conversation, but he was wrong to urge caution in starting a battle. Now Yara is a prisoner, along with Ellaria, and Cersei will get her priceless gift. Other than Targaryen blood, why does this woman think she has the right to rule?SighThe Euron Battle: I still loathe show Euron, but at least the show runners want to ensure that we believe he can fight and kill people. I like Yara very much, and Theon is one of my favorite characters in the book and show. But I really don\u2019t give a damn about Ellaria and the Sand Snakes\u2014I have no respect for what they did to Prince Doran, and I find them unbelievable as rulers. So it is a testimony to the scene that I found myself fearful when Euron got a hold of the Sand Snakes and killed two of them. (Nymeria and Obara\u2014thank you for the correction, Kelsey.) Euron has Yara, Ellaria and Tyene. I suspect the two dead Sand Snakes are the lucky ones as they died quickly. I don\u2019t think Yara is going to die, but we can say our goodbyes to Ellaria and her remaining Sand Snake who have overstayed their welcome as far as I\u2019m concerned. Euron was actually a bit scary, and Theon had a flashback to his PTSD from his time with Ramsay. Could he have saved Yara from Euron? No, he would have gotten killed and hurt her chances for survival. So Theon may end up saving his sister, and I hope he does. It would be nice if he could kill Euron, and put us out of our misery, but I think we are stuck with him for Season 7.Just STOP!We don\u2019t know what is happening to Edmure Tully. We didn\u2019t see Bran in this episode. But we had to have a long love scene between Grey Worm and Missandei. What the hell? This is something that only the show runners must care about, as I have yet to meet one fan who would rather watch Grey Worm and Missandei have show biz sex than see something actually happen to further the plot. Really. Can\u2019t we get back to the Night King and those really cool wight giants? We didn\u2019t need that scene, and we never will.I want to like this episode more than I do. I am rooting for Theon and Yara. Dany annoys me, not only because the show made me sick of her, but I just find her sense of privilege irritatingly smug, plus I see no leadership skills like I do with Jon Snow. I am glad Randyll Tarly will be a larger presence in the show, but I dread what I think awaits Olenna as I expect Jaime to lay siege to Highgarden in episode 3. I will be glad once all the Starks get to Winterfell as the show will feel less fragmented. And please: don\u2019t waste any more show minutes on Grey Worm and Missandei.", "As was the case for last week, this is part review, part recap.I liked this one. A lot. It had its dipshit moments and some heavy-handed moments but I feel like they know where they\u2019re going, which is more than I would have said before the season kicked off.The opening with the storm over Dragonstone is auspicious. I really like how this was done. It flirts with Dany being both self-aware and egotistical, Varys being both populist and conniving, Tyrion playing referee. Varys tells Dany the truth, Dany challenges Varys on his motives. They both have a point. Dany\u2019s threat to burn Varys alive if he betrays her is sort of a \u201chaha wink wink\u201d bit but she\u2019s actually done that to people before, so. This isn\u2019t cute hyperbole \u2014 you might think Varys deserves it if he backs off of her, sure, but she will do it.Called it (as did most people, surely). Dany\u2019s visitor is Melisandre. And Melisandre has pivoted from Stannis to Jon to Dany in terms of who\u2019s the prince(ss) that was promised (at least, she lets Dany believe that, although as others have pointed out she stop short of saying she now thinks it\u2019s Dany). I must say it\u2019s a bit strange for Melisandre to hold back a pretty critical bit of info on Jon, namely that he came back from the dead. Tyrion, expectedly, has a positive opinion of Jon. Melisandre leaves out that Jon\u2019s been dead but perhaps she wants Jon to tell Dany that himself? Seems like burying the lede.Aside: Melisandre told Jon he was the PTWP and he brushed it off. Dany, as I completely expected \u2014 I\u2019m only surprised it didn\u2019t happen last season in Meereen \u2014 is self-satisfied at the idea of fulfilling this prophecy. She\u2019s enjoying the spotlight of it and it feeds into her savior complex. Yet another contrast between the two.And there goes the hammer: Dany wants to meet Jon but she frames it as him coming to his queen to bend the knee. (Again, completely expected that Dany would frame a potential meeting this way; the catch is if it sticks.)Winterfell. Looking sharp. Jon, Sansa and Davos are going over Tyrion\u2019s note. It\u2019s funny to me that Jon seems more trusting of Tyrion than Sansa. Sansa notes that Tyrion is nice but she\u2019s still wary, smartly. Davos, bless him, hits on fire killing wights. This would have been a much better proactive reason to go to Dragonstone than the obsidian Sam stumbled upon (again?), but I guess better late than never.EDIT: It hit me that Tyrion\u2019s note, at least what we read/heard of it, did not seem to explicitly demand submission and fealty from Jon. Did Tyrion leave it out intentionally thinking Jon would balk if he included it? Was it unintentional? Is Jon going to show up to Dragonstone thinking, based on Tyrion\u2019s note, he\u2019s negotiating among equals only for Dany to demand submission? If Tyrion left it out intentionally, what\u2019s his plan for when it comes up?This, with Cersei, is goddamn brilliant, because: Cersei accuses Dany of nothing she didn\u2019t actually do. Sure, she leaves out the context of it, but the actual acts \u2014 mass crucifixions and feeding people to her dragons \u2014 Dany\u2019s guilty of. It\u2019s a great way to finally flip the context around Dany that I keep talking about. Even what Cersei says about the Dothraki rings true.I\u2019m guessing that in the book, Tarly ends up siding with Aegon but with Aegon cut they shifted him to the Lannisters (I suspect he just has to fight Dany, whatever else he does and whomever for). Wild guess. This is another nice bit of complexity, because on the one hand Randyll\u2019s an asshole, but on the other, he\u2019s still Sam\u2019s dad and Jaime argues a strong case. No easy sides here.The Oldtown stuff is the second-weakest part of the episode. However, if you\u2019d told me that Jorah\u2019s world-wide search for a greyscale cure would lead him to Sam, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. I think it\u2019s pretty limp-dick to make Sam\u2019s raison d\u2019etre at the Citadel be 1. dragonglass, something he already knew was there and 2. curing Jorah, but with the Faceless Men cut back I guess they had to do something else with him. Seems like a waste to me of what could be a pretty interesting side plot (literally any information could plausibly be in the Citadel).Dragon skulls! This was so cool. I\u2019m only surprised that we don\u2019t get the backstory of Meraxes and how she died, since that would only bolster Cersei\u2019s case. Also: If that big fuckin\u2019 bolt doesn\u2019t kill or at least hit one of those dragons, I will crane-kick a kitten. This is Chekhov\u2019s bolt, damn it.It all looks so easy, doesn\u2019t it! Army, fleet, dragons, boom done! I call 100% bullshit on Tyrion just sort of tsk\u2019ing his niece\u2019s murder, though. It is nice to know though that Dany\u2019s plot armor doesn\u2019t extend to the \u201cbest-laid plans\u201d trope. The plan as they lay it out is a good one, using Westerosi to take the capital and the foreign hordes to seize enemy territory. On paper, it looks smart. On paper!I\u2019m not sure what to make of Dany\u2019s chat with Olenna. It could end up being nothing or everything. The entire reason Dany has Tyrion is so she has someone smart who knows Westeros, and now Olenna is telling her to ignore him and go full-on dragon. Dany might resist that impulse as long as plans are working, but what will she do when her plans go to shit?I fast-forwarded through the entire Grey Worm/Missandei sex scene once it was clear what it was. I feel like I missed absolutely nothing. (Luckily this episode had this to keep the Oldtown stuff from being the low point.)I\u2019m gonna need more from Oldtown than Sam playing forensic pathologist. Also: Sam didn\u2019t have it bad enough last week with the chamber pots? Now we need Jorah\u2019s oozing cracked flesh? No thanks.Jorah, her name is Daenerys. Not khaleesi. Rookie mistake!The edit cut to Arya\u2019s pie is delightful. Bringing back Hot Pie was inspired and only shows how far Arya\u2019s come. It\u2019s a beautiful contrast. Also: If I didn\u2019t expect Sam to help Jorah\u2019s greyscale, I really, really, really did not ever expect Hot Pie to clue Arya in about Jon and the North.As soon as the Stark theme started playing over Arya leaving the inn, I knew she\u2019d be going back home. When she turned her horse I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a girl.\u201dJon has already been summoned to Dragonstone and Davos has already pointed out that dragons can kill wights \u2014 do we really need the dragonglass thing? Or at least, could we not get a reminder that \u201cStannis says Dragonstone has dragonglass too\u201d?So does Sam know Jon is King in the North now or not? As of the end of the last season Sam thought Jon was still lord commander of the Night\u2019s Watch (itself super outdated at that point) but now Sam\u2019s ravens are going to Winterfell. Uh?This exchange with Jon and Sansa and the bannermen reminds me strongly of Tyrion arguing with Missandei and Grey Worm about the wisdom of cutting a deal with the slavers. That ended up blowing up in Tyrion\u2019s face. So who\u2019s going to be right here? Jon for wanting to be proactive about an alliance, or Sansa and Co. for advising caution? Jon, of course, is looking for a straight-up alliance. Dany is expecting a supplicant offering fealty. Who blinks first or do they meet in the middle?Jon leaving Sansa in charge of the North was expected but also wholly welcome. I flirted with the idea, for a second, that Jon might actually transfer his title to Sansa \u2014 making her Queen in the North \u2014 as a compromise, but he\u2019s right that only royalty can cut a deal with Dany. Leaving her in charge seems sufficient and if Dany burns him alive (hahaha), Sansa can easily slide into the role.Aside: The Jon-Sansa alliance is transitioning nicely. Jon proactively asks Sansa\u2019s advice on how to read Tyrion, and he hands the reins to her while he\u2019s gone. That takes a massive amount of trust. Sansa seems surprised, honored and pleased when he does it. It\u2019s a nice moment. I also love Brienne\u2019s little smile.This is the most awk convo ever. Baelish is like \u201cAw I love Cat,\u201d and Jon has to be thinking, \u201c\u2026 Dude. Dude.\u201d Baelish is correct that Jon owes him for the Vale knights. Jon is also correct to throttle the shit out of him for perving on Sansa. Berserker Jon from the books makes an all-too-brief appearance. Jon\u2019s silhouette as he leaves the crypt is wonderfully framed \u2014 imposing yet filling a relatively small part of the frame.Now I just wonder what Baelish has up his sleeve if he thinks Jon\u2019s going to cockblock him with Sansa and/or Sansa will reject him.Here\u2019s my take on Arya and Nymeria: Arya isn\u2019t enough of a Stark yet to be worthy of her direwolf. She\u2019s still consumed by vengeance. She\u2019s on the right path, going to Winterfell instead of to King\u2019s Landing, but it will take time. I also loved the touch that the regular wolves surrounding Arya \u2014 at least the ones featured \u2014 had the same coloring as the Starks\u2019 other direwolves: black, white, gray, etc. (Intentional or not, I noticed it immediately.) Not only did Nymeria reject Arya, but the pack also rejected her by extension. Arya has to become worthy again not only of her own individual direwolf, but of the pack itself.The good Greyjoys\u2019 fleet. The Sand Snakes are still annoying as shit. Did we have Theon slip into the Victarion role just to be Ellaria\u2019s beer wench? And there\u2019s Yara and Ellaria making out; glad we got that over with.In hindsight, Yara saying Theon would be her protector should have been a red flag. It\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019ll speak again when I return.\u201dI was not expecting such a big fight so soon but good lord this was glorious. They still have a long way to go to make Euron EURON but this was a good start. They have Euron the stab-happy psycho down, now they need to up his scheming and intelligence a bit. But I\u2019ll take it.Euron kills two of those fucking annoying Sand Snakes and kidnaps the third, along with Ellaria, and he\u2019s \u2026 the bad guy? That is not fair, people.Not what I expected Euron to do with Yara. I thought Theon would hesitate and Euron would open her throat. Theon choosing to jump into the water is, in comparison, almost blackly comedic. And what\u2019s he going to do now, swim back to Dragonstone and explain that Euron kidnapped Yara, Ellaria and Tyene? How\u2019s that going to go?So to recap: The force that was going to besiege King\u2019s Landing so Dany wouldn\u2019t have to do it with Dothraki has lost its navy and two of Dany\u2019s three regional leaders. Euron has hostages to take to Cersei to do God only knows what with. (We know that next week Cersei, um, returns a gift, but \u2026 eeesh. Hard to see any of those three women just being let go so it makes you wonder what \u201creturn\u201d entails, really.)This might affect how and if Dany takes what Olenna said to heart. Ellaria and Yara aren\u2019t there anymore to offer alternative voices to Olenna. And the King\u2019s Landing siege plan (Tyrion\u2019s brainchild, based on how it was sold) has gone to hell, so does Dany go scorched earth now like Olenna suggested, even disregarding Tyrion\u2019s advice?Final thoughts: Strong episode. Weak parts were, as I said, the meh direction they\u2019re taking the Citadel in and that complete waste of time that was Missandei and Grey Worm\u2019s sex scene. (Who did they make that for, exactly?) The show needed to put some chinks in Dany\u2019s armor to make the result feel less inevitable and I think it succeeded. We also got nice set-up of the Jon/Dany meeting and how it might pan out, although I wish the show had picked one thing and stuck to it \u2014 Are they going for dragonglass? Are they going for allies? Are they going because Dany ordered them to? \u2014 instead of throwing the kitchen sink at Jon\u2019s decision to go. I\u2019m relieved Arya found common sense (thanks, Hot Pie!) and I hope she gets to see her wolf again in better days."]}, "63": {"id": "s07e03", "name": "Queen's Justice", "script": "I wish you all the happiness in the world.  - JAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella? - (PANTING)  Myrcella?  (SCREAMS)  Kill us!  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  Please try not to scream.  (GRUNTING)  MEERA REED: This is Brandon Stark.  Son of Ned Stark.  Let's get them inside.  TYRION LANNISTER: For decades, House Lannister  has been the true power in Westeros,  and the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock,  and take it.  Summon Jon Snow.  TYRION: He would make a valuable ally.  MELISANDRE: Let him stand before you and tell you the things  that have happened to him.  Dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass.  We can never hope to defeat the army of the dead alone.  We need allies.  You're abandoning your people! You're abandoning your home.  Until I return, the North is yours.  ( theme music playing )   The bastard of Winterfell.  The dwarf of Casterly Rock.  I believe we last saw each other atop the Wall.  You were pissing off the edge if I remember right.  Picked up some scars along the road.  It's been a long road, but we're both still here.  I'm Tyrion Lannister.  - Davos Seaworth. - Ah, the Onion Knight.  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.  Unluckily for me.  Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.  Welcome to Dragonstone.  Our queen knows it is a long journey.  She appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf.  If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.  Of course.  ( men murmuring )  Please, this way.  Where are you from?  I can't place the accent.  I was born on the Island of Naath.  Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there.  Palm trees and butterflies.  Haven't been, myself.  This place has changed.  Tyrion: And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.  - Jon: She is. - Does she miss me terribly?  A sham marriage. And unconsummated.  - I didn't ask. - Well, it was. Wasn't.  Anyway  she's much smarter than she lets on.  She's starting to let on.  Good.  Tyrion: At some point,  I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit became King in the North.  As long as you tell me how a Lannister  became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.  A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.  My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.  Of course they do.  If I was your Hand, I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb--  Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.  True  but I'm not a Stark.  ( screeching )  ( panting )  I'd say you get used to them  but you never really do.  Come, their mother is waiting for you.  I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?  I've done my part.  I've brought ice and fire together.  Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,  but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.  My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.  Oh, I doubt that.  Give us common folk one taste of power,  we're like the lion who tasted man.  Nothing is ever so sweet again.  Neither of us is common folk anymore.  I did not part on good terms  with the King in the North or his advisor.  Why?  Because of mistakes I made.  Terrible mistakes.  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.  - So, where will you go? - Volantis.  Good.  If you don't mind my saying,  I don't think you should return to Westeros.  I'm not sure you'd be safe here.  Oh, I will return, dear Spider.  - One last time. - My lady--  I have to die in this strange country.  Just like you.  Missandei: You stand in the presence  of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,  rightful heir to the Iron Throne,  rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men,  Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,  the Mother of Dragons,  the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,  the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.  This is Jon Snow.  He's King in the North.  Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.  I hope the seas weren't too rough.  The winds were kind, Your Grace.  Apologies, I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know,  but Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.  - He's not a lord. - Forgive me--  Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.  Forgive me, Ser Davos.  I never did receive a formal education,  but I could have sworn I read  the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark,  who bent the knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.  In exchange for his life and the lives of the Northmen,  Torrhen Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.  Or do I have my facts wrong?  I wasn't there, Your Grace.  No, of course not.  But still, an oath is an oath.  And perpetuity means--  what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?  Forever.  Forever.  - So I assume, my lord - ( sighs )  you're here to bend the knee.  I am not.  Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've traveled all this way  to break faith with House Targaryen?  Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms--  My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen  I ask your forgiveness  for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter  by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries,  and those were the best centuries  the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity  with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne  and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together, we will save this country  from those who would destroy it.  You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crimes.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.  Then why are you here?  Because I need your help, and you need mine.  Did you see three dragons  flying overhead when you arrived?  I did.  And did you see the Dothraki,  all of whom have sworn to kill for me?  They're hard to miss.  - But still, I need your help? - Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.  - Almost. - But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see  is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war,  but you won't do it,  which means, at the very least,  you're better than Cersei.  Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.  Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else,  we're children playing at a game,  screaming that the rules aren't fair.  - You told me you liked this man. - I do.  In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen,  he's refused to bow, and now he's calling me a child.  I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.  Your Grace, everyone you know will die before winter's over  if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.  I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.  The dead?  Is that another figure of speech?  The Army of the Dead is on the march.  The Army of the Dead?  You don't know me well, my lord,  but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?  No, I don't think you're either of those things.  The Army of the Dead is real.  The white walkers are real.  The Night King is real. I've seen them.  If they get past the Wall  and we're squabbling amongst ourselves  we're finished.  I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.  We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins  to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now, of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me,  I don't remember all their names.  I have been sold like a broodmare.  I've been chained and betrayed,  raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing  through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods,  not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries  until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea, any sea.  They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,  and I will.  You'll be ruling over a graveyard  if we don't defeat the Night King.  The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities  and join you in fighting  whatever you saw beyond the Wall.  You don't believe him.  I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.  But if destiny has brought Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,  it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros?  He is the first to make allies of wildlings and Northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard.  All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader  because they believe in him.  All those things you don't believe in,  he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own--  If we don't put aside our enmities and band together,  we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.  If it doesn't matter, then you might as well kneel.  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,  help her to defeat my sister,  and together, our armies will protect the North.  There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this!  While we stand here, debating--  It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.  And why would I do that?  I mean no offense, Your Grace,  but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell,  your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name,  and my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the North  placed their trust in me to lead them,  and I will continue to do so as well as I can.  That's fair.  It's also fair to point out  that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom,  you are in open rebellion.  ( footsteps approaching )  ( whispering ) Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.  I have grave news.  You must forgive my manners.  You'll both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.  ( speaking Dothraki )  Am I your prisoner?  Not yet.  Our ironborn and Dornish allies  were attacked en route to Dorne.  - And? - Two or three ships escaped,  the rest, sunk or captured.  Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, dead or captured.  The Greyjoys, dead or captured.  All of them?  ( men shouting )  - Pull! - Heave!  Pull!  ( men grunt )  ( grunts )  Your sister's dead?  Euron has her.  You saw him take her?  - But you got away? - I couldn't save her.  I tried.  You wouldn't be here if you tried.  Man: Come, men!  Sails up!  ( crowd cheering )  Woman: Murderer!  Man: Whores!  - ( all shouting ) - Traitor!  This is the life.  Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy.  ( cheering )  - ( grunts ) - ( laughter )  I have to be honest,  this is making me hard.  Did you see Little Theon's face  right before he jumped overboard?  \"Oh, no!\" ( laughs )  What a twat.  ( crowd booing )  - ( crowd shouting ) - ( spits )  - Man: Whore! Whore! Whore! - Man #2: Murderers!  ( applause )  ( grunts )  My queen, please accept this gift  on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.  ( both grunt, gasp )  I give you what no other man could give--  justice.  Justice for your murdered daughter.  You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas  and a true friend to the crown.  You deserve more than a true friend.  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.  There's only one reward I want.  You shall have what your heart desires  when the war is won.  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces  and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,  the sons and daughters of Westeros  shall defend our country.  ( crowd cheering )  There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  Though I suppose you wouldn't know.  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.  And if you turn on us,  they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.  Or yours.  They just like severed heads, really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all,  I would love to hear it.  When we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.  Advice?  Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?  Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now. We'll talk later.  Cersei: I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I,  I understand the fury that drives you.  I was there that day  when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  If I close my eyes,  I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.  The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, \"That's true love.\"  Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's buried somewhere.  And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me,  my only daughter  well, you can't imagine how that feels  unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me  to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother,  but Myrcella did.  She was mine, and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?  Doesn't matter now.  Your daughter's a beauty, too.  Those brown eyes.  Those lips.  Perfect Dornish beauty.  I imagine she's your favorite.  I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites,  but still, we're only human.  We love whom we love.  ( muffled speech )  I'm sorry, I can't understand you.  That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.  We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.  - ( grunts ) - Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well.  Not at all, really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy  and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor  crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic, I suppose, but fast, too fast.  I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.  She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face  cracking open like a duck egg,  no, it's just not right.  - ( Tyene whimpers ) - ( gasps )  Mama.  ( grunts )  ( crying )  Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The Long Goodbye, was that it?  - The Long Farewell. - That's the one.  How long does the poison take?  Qyburn: Difficult to say-- hours, days.  It depends on the subject's constitution.  - But death is certain? - Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.  Your daughter will die here in this cell,  and you will be here watching when she does.  You'll be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat, we'll force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot.  - To watch that beautiful face collapse - ( sobbing )  to bone and dust.  All the while contemplating the choices you've made.  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.  ( both crying )  No.  ( panting )  ( birds chirping )  ( knocking on door )  Don't.  What are you doing? No one can see us like this.  I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.  Forgive me, Your Grace.  The visitor from Braavos has arrived.  Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.  At once, Your Grace.  ( chuckles )  ( liquid pouring )  No, thank you.  My condolences, Your Grace,  on the death of your son.  From all reports, he was a fine young man.  The Iron Bank didn't send you here to offer condolences.  Condolences and congratulations.  To become the first ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,  that's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition,  freeing the crown from elements  who sought to subvert the rule of law.  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.  Indeed, but sometimes tragedies are necessary  to restore order and rational leadership.  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.  Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you're now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be.  And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.  Your wealthiest allies, the Tyrells, are now your enemies.  You are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.  We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.  A fancy way of saying \"bet.\"  The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.  Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.  Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.  For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full-grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire-breathing dragons?  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are your profits  now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?  The slave trade has entered a downturn, it's true.  From what I gather, she considers herself  more of a revolutionary than a monarch.  In your experience, how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries?  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money,  but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?  Your father's daughter, indeed.  Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.  And when you return to Braavos,  I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full.  I came down here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.  I'm a prisoner on this island.  I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle,  the beaches, to go wherever you want.  Except to my ship.  You took my ship.  I wouldn't say we took your ship.  I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.  Why don't you figure out what to do  about my missing fleet and murdered allies,  and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.  It's hard for me to fathom. It really is.  If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King  You probably don't believe me.  I do, actually.  You didn't before.  \"Grumkins and snarks,\" you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.  It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them  and you saw them.  And I trust the eyes of an honest man  more than I trust what everybody knows.  How do I convince people who don't know me  that an enemy they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?  - Good question. - I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.  People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White walkers, the Night King,  Army of the Dead--  it's almost a relief to confront  a comfortable, familiar monster like my sister.  I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North  by giving up that easily.  Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter,  a foreign invader.  And here I am,  a Northern fool.  Children are not their fathers,  luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders  and Northern fools than meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.  Instead, she stayed where she was  and saved many people from horrible fates,  some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here,  you might consider asking them  what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters,  just as you do.  It's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north  to fight an enemy she's never seen  on the word of a man she doesn't know.  After a single meeting,  it's not a reasonable thing to ask.  So, do you have anything reasonable to ask?  What do you mean?  Maybe you are a Northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.  - Dragonglass? - Tyrion: Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.  And what does the King in the North want with dragonglass?  Apparently, it can be turned into weapons  that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.  Or stop them.  Destroy them.  Unsure about the nomenclature.  And what do you think about this Army of the Dead  and white walkers and Night Kings?  I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong.  But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing  simply because you want to believe it.  Which wise man said this?  I don't remember.  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?  I would never do that.  To you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come.  And he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the dragonglass.  If he's wrong, it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship  with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand--  Casterly Rock.  What was that Ser Davos said  about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?  You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the North.  ( screeching )  Amazing thing to see.  I named them for my brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.  They're both gone now.  You lost two brothers as well.  People thought dragons were gone forever, but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.  You've been talking to Tyrion.  He is my Hand.  - He enjoys talking. - We all enjoy what we're good at.  I don't.  You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.  I never expected that you would.  And I haven't changed my mind  about which kingdoms belong to that throne.  I haven't either.  ( sighs )  I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you.  Thank you.  So you believe me, then, about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?  You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.  ( chatter )  How much do we have?  4,000 bushels, my lady.  What does that mean?  For the current occupants of the castle,  it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.  And what's the longest winter in the past hundred years?  Uh, I'm not entirely certain.  I-I'll check Maester Luwin's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.  You're telling me we don't have enough food,  especially not if the armies of the North come back to defend Winterfell?  No, my lady, most likely not.  Then we must prepare for that eventuality.  Whatever direction the threat comes from,  this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores  with regular shipments from every keep in the North.  If we don't use it by winter's end, we'll give it back to them.  But if the entire North has to flee to Winterfell,  they won't have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.  Very wise, my lady.  Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?  Are they covering those breastplates in leather?  No, my lady.  Well, shouldn't they be? Once the real cold comes?  They should, indeed.  Pardon me, my lady.  You there, why isn't there leather on these?  Command suits you.  The Northerners are all facing north,  worried about the threat from beyond the Wall.  So they should be.  I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her--  You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.  I only meant to say--  That the woman who murdered my mother, father, and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise counsel.  One of two things will happen--  either the dead will defeat the living,  in which case  all our troubles come to an end,  or life will win out.  And what then?  Don't fight in the North or the South.  Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy,  everyone is your friend  every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something  that you've seen before.  Lady Sansa, at the gate.  ( people murmuring )  Hello, Sansa.  ( sobbing )  I wish Jon were here.  Yes, I need to speak to him.  You're Father's last living trueborn son.  You're Lord of Winterfell now.  I can never be Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.  I don't know what that means.  It's difficult to explain.  Try. Please, for me.  It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces now, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the Long Night comes again,  I need to be ready.  How do you know all this?  The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.  I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.  I told you it's difficult to explain.  ( sighs )  Bran--  I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here in our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling, just like now.  And you were so beautiful  in your white wedding dress.  I have to go back inside, Bran.  I'll stay a bit longer.  ( man coughing in distance )  Hmm.  Hmm.  Does it hurt?  A bit. Less than before.  The infection no longer appears to be active.  ( sighs )  Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven  for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided  and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.  Don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it.  And the climate.  The climate.  You're free to go, ser.  This chamber is needed for the infectious,  which you are no longer.  Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.  How bad is it?  Suppose I'll find out this evening.  - Where will you go? - ( grunts )  I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me  or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is back with her.  I owe her my life.  Her and you.  ( chuckles )  Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do.  Perhaps our paths will cross again.  I hope they do.  - Ebrose: You treated him? - Yes.  Who told you to treat him?  No one.  Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?  I seem to remember you.  - But you treated him anyway? - I did, yes.  I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful,  especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links  have attempted it and failed.  Yet you succeeded.  How?  I read the books and followed the instructions.  That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.  Thank you, Archmaester.  Come here.  All these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them.  You were expecting a reward.  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  And careful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well.  We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.  Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him--  I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.  Would you have to go yourself?  Euron's ships could be anywhere  or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone  for who knows how long.  I wouldn't be alone.  I would have Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?  Missandei: They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.  It's too great a risk. You're too important.  What about Casterly Rock?  The Unsullied will be there soon.  And what will they face?  A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.  Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life  is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.  - No one has ever taken the Rock. - Man: Archers!  Tyrion: The Lannister Army is still the army my father built.  - Come on! - Tyrion: Well-trained and well-provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming.  They will be ready.  ( men shouting )  - Man: Draw! Loose! - Man #2: Loose!  Tyrion: The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.  ( men grunting )  The fight up the walls will be hard.  We will be at a disadvantage.  - ( grunts ) - Many men will die.  Just as my father said they would.  Interesting thing about my father--  he built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army, he built Casterly Rock as we know it,  but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him,  so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find--  me.  He was right, I was low.  The company I kept, low.  Women, mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  Couldn't walk them through the front gates,  I couldn't have them in my chambers,  so in the process of building the sewers,  I threw in something for myself.  It was a passage that began  in an out of the way cove by the sea  and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.  No better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground.  Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress.  ( grunts, wheezes )  But as a good friend of mine once said,  \"Give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.\"  - ( grunting ) - ( all shouting )  And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.  But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.  The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom  and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triumph.        ( distant explosions )  Where are they?!  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?  ( men shouting )  ( chatter )  ( door opens )  - It's done. - It is.  And now the rains weep o'er our halls.  Did we fight well?  Uh, as well as could be expected.  It was never our forte.  Golden roses, indeed.  Your brother and his new queen  thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.  The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me,  but my fond childhood memories  won't keep Cersei on the throne.  So you just let them take it?  For now. They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,  we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually, they'll be forced to abandon their position  and march all the way across Westeros.  And you took your army, your real army,  and went where they weren't.  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.  Yes. You must be very wise by now.  My father always said I was a slow learner.  If he was so clever,  why didn't he take Highgarden  the moment your gold mines ran dry?  ( scoffs )  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?  That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?  Widow's Wail.  He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family.  Or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary  for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.  But your sister has done things  I was incapable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake--  a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?  To you, I'm sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us,  when people are living peacefully in the world she built,  do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?  You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.  Possibly.  Not much to be gained  from discussing it with you, though, is there?  What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have  that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far,  it's gone beyond your control.  Yes.  It has.  She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will, too.  I think we're done here.  How will it happen?  Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets  and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.  Will there be pain?  No. I made sure of that.  That's good.  I'd hate to die like your son.  Clawing at my neck,  foam and bile spilling from my mouth,  eyes bloodred, skin purple.  Must have been horrible for you,  as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I had never seen the poison work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me.", "summary": null, "review": ["I\u2019ve been a fan of the Lannisters since the first episode of Thrones, and you can imagine how much I enjoyed The Queen\u2019s Justice. The episode had practically no weak points from a plot-development perspective, with everyone\u2019s decisions making logical and political sense.The Boy who cried White WalkerThe scenes in Dragonstone were great. Having seen everything that Jon has, it\u2019s easy for the audience to be naive and brand Dany an idiot for not listening to Jon sooner. But as Tyrion explains ever so patiently, it is unreasonable to expect her to jump on board Jon\u2019s plan so quickly.It was interesting to see Jon adamant about not giving up his title; again this makes sense \u2014 if he went back to the North a lesser lord, he\u2019d undoubtedly get flak from Sansa and have to spend time delivering boilerplate HR answers to his liege lords about how the change in his title was a mere technicality. Like I said in another answer, Jon doesn\u2019t have the time for these distractions, and him standing firm to Daenerys helps his cause here. Jon emerges as the clear winner in this negotiation (thanks to Tyrion \u2014 whose side is he on again?), getting the Dragonglass he needs without having to give up anything in return.I also found the exchange between Melisandre and Varys intriguing. The scene left me wanting answers to several pressing questions \u2014 will Melisandre and Varys actually die in Westeros, and under what circumstances? Does Melisandre know Varys from before? And what is the secret behind Varys\u2019 enviable tan?The Three-Eyed DickwadI know that the main takeaway from Bran\u2019s scene with Sansa is that he no longer identifies as Bran Stark, and that he\u2019s fully embraced his new life as the Three-Eyed Raven (contrast this with Arya\u2019s arc). I further concede that he\u2019s probably become desensitized given the scale of everything he\u2019s seen in his visions. I also accept Tabitha Davis\u2019 insightful point about this being the simplest way for Bran to truly highlight the scale of his powers to Sansa. But none of this takes away from the fact that he was a supreme dick to Sansa this episode; that too just when she\u2019d started to realize her potential as a leader. #NotAllRavensAlso, did anyone else find it strange that right after Baelish launched into a strange monologue advising Sansa to visualize everything that can ever happen all at once, up stepped Bran who can literally do all that Baelish had just been describing?The Red DevilsWhat a fantastic episode this was for the Lannister twins!There was something poetic about Cersei and Jaime killing their children\u2019s murderers using the same modus operandi that had caused Myrcella and Joffrey\u2019s deaths (although Jaime did afford Olenna some mercy and the opportunity to make one last thorny barb).Cersei had flirted with the possibility of loving Jaime openly a few seasons back, and it was awesome seeing her throw caution to the winds this episode.Also worth noting, given the appearance of Cersei\u2019s early-morning messenger, is that Cersei hasn\u2019t lost her place as King\u2019s Landing Trendsetter-in-Chief when it comes to women\u2019s hairstyles. Remember an impressionable Sansa getting her hair done like a proper Southern Lady back in Season 1?Jaime, having initially been cuckolded by the ribald Euron (whose brand of villain seems to unfortunately be growing on me), regains his composure, and displays perspicacious military foresight to lay waste to yet another opponent and prevent the Iron Bank from foreclosing on the Crown\u2019s assets.With four more episodes to come, it seems likely that, frustrated with the failure of Tyrion\u2019s clever plans, Dany will heed Olenna\u2019s advice and become the dragon. As usual, King\u2019s Landing\u2019s denizens will probably bear the brunt of the fire, but given their propensity for chucking garbage at women they barely know, I wouldn\u2019t feel too bad for them.", "My disorganized list (which I apologize for).I loved the no-filler cut straight to Jon landing at Dragonstone. Now that\u2019s what I call fast travel. Tyrion and Jon\u2019s greetings were spot on, and in line with both men\u2019s characters.Taking their weapons away was more than a bit odd, though. We have never seen that before, except oh wait, the Mad King, who forbade all bladed weapons in his presence. Foreshadowing or coincidence?Drogon buzzing Jon just as he says \u2018I\u2019m not a Stark\u2019 to Tyrion. Sometimes a little subtlety is a good thing, dear showrunners.Tyrion and Jon broach the subject of Sansa\u2019s marriage and resolve to let it go unspoken of, which is really the best thing they can do under the circumstances.The show cheated us out of Melisandre\u2019s reunion with Jon and Davos it promised in the last episode, after she promised to reveal her secrets to Daenerys and Jon. Now that they\u2019re both here, she\u2019s leaving? Why? And why to Volantis? There are only two things in Volantis that could be of use to Melisandre in the coming war, one of which is the massed strength of the Red Priests of R\u2019hllor, whose leader in the show is Kinvara. The other is the legendary Golden Company, a free company formed by the exiled survivors of the Blackfyre Rebellions and chock full of exiled Westerosi rebels. I hope they are recruited by Melisandre to fight the undead and finally restore themselves to the land of their birth.Melisandre also tells Varys that both of them are destined to die in Westeros, having been born in Essos. She is foretelling Varys\u2019s death, but is this \u2018a dying of natural causes in ripe old age\u2019 death or \u2018trying to betray Daenerys when a new Targaryen heir is made known, and getting burnt alive by her dragons\u2019 death? I don\u2019t know, but with every episode, my hope for a Mad Daenerys storyline becomes more justified. Could also be apophenia on my part, though.The best part of Daenerys\u2019s conversation with Jon is her finally using her big power line, and not having to listen to it in trailers any more. What I didn\u2019t get is why Jon didn\u2019t mention Rhaegar\u2019s \u201cabduction\u201d of Lyanna when he demonstrates to Daenerys that the Targaryens were the first to break the faith. Sure, we viewers know the truth of the R+L=J situation, but Jon doesn\u2019t, and he should have mentioned that, especially when Daenerys talks about Lord Eddard being a friend of Robert.I voiced my objections with Euron suddenly becoming a conquering hero to the people of King\u2019s Landing in the trailer itself, so I won\u2019t repeat that here. Today\u2019s Euron was a little less than the Euron of last episode, probably because he\u2019s talking again. Still, it was amazing to see him wind up Jaime like they were actually brothers, and Euron was the prankster while Jaime was the upstanding one. In the books, Euron has killed more than one of his brothers and sexually abused two of them.Cersei killing Tyene with a modified version of the poison Ellaria used on Myrcella makes sense, until you look closely at it. The Sand Snakes, particularly Tyene, are masters at making and modifying venom, something they learned at the feet of their father. How is Qyburn suddenly an expert in alchemy and magic? At best, his areas of expertise are healing and a non-magical form of necromancy.I guess the incest between Jaime and Cersei is all out in the open now, and everyone in the Red Keep need only look at where the Sept of Baelor used to be, if they ever feel the need to discuss this with anyone. Cersei is ruling through fear, and Jaime is not only letting her do it, but actively helping her do it, as long as he keeps getting her. I\u2019m losing more and more respect in Jaime\u2019s transformation by every episode and Olenna echoes my feelings as she observes that Jaime is too far gone. If he is to abandon Cersei\u2019s side in a future episode, I don\u2019t see how that could happen without seeming incongruous and abrupt.Tyrion realizes that he\u2019s landed himself the unfortunate role of the man who has to balance the scales between the Mother of Dragons and the Prince of Ice and Fire. He counsels both sides to stay, wait and get a better measure of the other. Jon is grateful for being given leave to mine dragonglass and in upcoming episodes, he will repay that in some way.Sansa is so freaking competent and cool as the administrator, and I love her in this new role she\u2019s found herself in, as it suits her to a T. Littlefinger hangs around her, indulging in his monologues and playing games, and this is ultimately what will cost him his life. Yeah, I am convinced that he\u2019s going to die. She embraces Bran in much the same way Jon embraced her, but it is not reciprocated. More on that here.Jorah is completely cured and ready to leave. Predictable, but not reasonable. Still, Sam\u2019s reward is a pile of dusty old scrolls instead of an instant silver link, which sounds unfair, but those one of those scrolls contains proof of Jon\u2019s parentage. Sam is being made into the show\u2019s revealer of secrets, and the show may confirm that he is the writer and narrator of the books within the universe (as Yandel wrote A World of Ice and Fire). Bran believes that Jon is the illegitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna, so Sam would come up with the other bit of info, that Jon is trueborn and his parents were legally married.The fall of the Rock and the fall of Highgarden were events that many, including I, had predicted (more on that here). The death of Olenna, and the burn them all encouragement she gave to Daenerys, is the final domino to fall before Daenerys overrules Tyrion\u2019s more considerate war doctrine and unleashes both the dragons and the Dothraki on the Reach lords who sided with the Lannisters. I expect the next episode to be the end of the Tarly family, as they will fall under attack both from land and air.", "(Show Spoilers) That was a good episode. I consider it the best in the season so far.Jon and Daenerys: I counted 8 titles for Daenerys while Davos managed to come up with one for Jon-King in the North. Jon realized that going south is never a good idea for a Stark. Certainly Dany knew the history of Torrhen Stark, but did she remember that there was another king in the north called Robb Stark? It was painful to watch her try to boss Jon around, as he wondered what kind of fresh hell is this? Bend the knee? Warden of the North? And we got that much repeated line: \u201cI was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.\u201d I didn\u2019t expect her to say that to Jon, and really, I felt embarrassed for her.However, I do expect the alliance has already begun. Daenerys must know that Jon will not bend the knee, plus Varys had to break the news to her that most of their fleet was destroyed. This episode showed that Jon is right: they do need each other. Cersei will not go gently into that good night, and Tyrion really does want Jon as an ally. It is very bad form to use guest right\u2019s badly against a Stark as Jon is a prisoner, but he did convince Tyrion to let him mine the dragon glass. I sense the show is trying to make their relationship interesting to us, and that makes me very uncomfortable.Battle for Casterly Rock: I didn\u2019t expect the Casterly Rock takeover to go so smoothly. Nor did Grey Worm. Euron destroyed the ships of the Unsullied, so Grey Worm has to keep Casterly Rock or else. I have a very bad feeling that Daenerys does not understand the word \u201cfortification\u201d. This was also a problem in the books with Yunkai and Astapor, when Daenerys was at Meereen. I sense the Unsullied are going to get picked off at Casterly Rock. I also was disappointed in the setting. Casterly Rock is a tall mountain that spells intimidation and power. I felt I was looking at Rivendell minus the elven protection spells. I hope Dany doesn\u2019t take her dragons to King\u2019s Landing. Instead, they should go to Casterly Rock and blow fire and blood onto Euron\u2019s spitfires.Grey Worm is still alive.King\u2019s Landing: Really, the people of King\u2019s Landing are sheep. They are cheering Euron for what? Has Yara attacked their city? Ellaria was there two years ago as a guest. Defiant to the end, Ellaria spat at the crowd, while Yara just looked humiliated and frightened. There was nothing particularly likable about this section except that we were spared any gruesome violence. Even though I expected this to be Ellaria\u2019s and Tyene\u2019s swan song, I couldn\u2019t help but marvel as Cersei\u2019s cruelty: she poisoned Tyene and she will make sure Ellaria lives to see it. It looks like Ellaria will be kept alive for as long as Cersei is able. I expected something more violent, but I must say that as vengeance goes, it is probably very effective. I was further creeped out that afterwards Cersei finds Jaime for a roll in the sack. I guess vengeance and suffering gets Cersei excited\u2014a bit like the Mad King. It was well done, but I wondered if Jaime understood why Cersei was suddenly so amorous. Did he know what she did with Ellaria and Tyene? Did he approve of the probable cause for her sudden interest in his body? Cersei did mention a queenly perk: now we can get naked and no one can say boo because I am the Queen. Maybe Jaime can live with that.Highgarden: The show\u2019s need to cover two battles in one episode meant that neither one looked particularly interesting. Randyll Tarly was there. I hope we see more of him soon. The heart of the battle was the conversation between Jaime and Olenna, who admitted to killing Joffery while wondering how Jaime could possibly love Cersei. Show Jaime is really getting on my nerves. He actually seemed surprised that Olenna was the culprit. Had he really thought Tyrion killed Joffery? I don\u2019t know what the show is doing with his character, but that just struck me as naive. He allowed her to be poisoned, and now we have lost one of the best characters on the show. She couldn\u2019t wait to drink her death wine\u2014good night, House Tyrell. Another score for Cersei and the sheep of King\u2019s Landing.Winterfell: Littlefinger is flattering and advising Sansa, confusing her with actually some decent counsel\u2014plan for all outcomes. (It also struck me as the show\u2019s nod to Bran returning to Winterfell as he can see the past and the present, and possible future.) Of course, he means something else entirely, but the show didn\u2019t give us enough time to figure that one out. The greatest part was seeing Bran and hearing his words that he needed to speak with Jon. We can assume he wants to tell him of his birth as well as what he knows of the Night King. Bran certainly freaked Sansa out when he described her wedding dress and told her that he regretted how much she has suffered. It made me realize how little I saw Sansa with any of her siblings, save Arya. Bran has changed. He accepts his role as the greenseer. He is sitting right by the weirwood, so I hope for some more visions. I don\u2019t know how much help he will be to Sansa in ruling, however.OldTown: Yes! Sam got off the hook! He saved Jorah and got to stay in the Citadel. I was hoping for that, but expected a dismissal. Of course, he now has to go through a bunch of old documents to make copies. Will he find something about Rhaegar and Lyanna? Will he learn of a baby\u2019s birth that has the bloodline of Stark and Targaryen? Will he find out more about Valyrian Steel as to why it is able to kill the White Walkers? Jorah goes off to Dany with Sam as a friend in his mind\u2014-this will help Jon\u2019s cause and probably bring the alliance between Dragonstone and the North into prominence.Foreshadowing of the Week: Melisandre told Varys that she will go to Volantis. Varys advised her not to come back. She told him that she is meant to die in this land, as is he. Will we find out Varys\u2019 connection to R\u2019hllor? Will he die by fire after ditching Dany? Will Melisandre die fighting the Night King? Will she help Jon Snow win? That brief scene was spectacular, and very interesting.I think this was a good episode. No, the show is not back to its early greatness, but the episode did what it had to do, and I found Cersei in particular quite impressive as she is not going to lie down and die for anyone\u2019s convenience. There is something almost magnificent in her damaged evil. I hope Theon will redeem himself in the eyes of his countrymen, as I am tired of everyone failing to understand that he did the smart thing in getting away. I just want him to save Yara, as I hated seeing her as Euron\u2019s prisoner, and really hope she survives.", "I\u2019m apparently in the minority here, but I thought this episode was terrible. (In the event you aren\u2019t interest in my old man rants, please skip the first two sections.)Thought #1: Why sort of secret leverage does Mark Mylod have?He\u2019s the weakest of the show\u2019s regular directors, yet he got brought back for two episodes in this short season. I genuinely don\u2019t understand why. Of his four prior outings, three are rated in the show\u2019s bottom 10 on IMDB (5.3 6.7 6.8).My main criticism is that he approaches every scene like he was doing network TV, which is to say that he doesn\u2019t seem to think much of his audience. His winks are all exaggerated and his dialogue is maximalist in the worst way. Every scene in this episode was 30% too long and far too literal.Case in point, the exchange between Sansa and her advisors.Sansa: \u201cHey, what\u2019s the longest winter we\u2019ve ever had?\u201dDude: \u201cI dunno. I guess I could check the standard almanac. But, hey, did you know the previous maesters kept every single raven scroll sent to and from Winterfell?\u201dLittlefinger then does an eyebrow lift that would make The Rock proud, just to make sure we caught the foreshadowing. And we see that same hamfistedness in Olenna\u2019s prediction of Jaime\u2019s coming turn and the heavy implication that Sam is going to find something in the rotting scrolls. (I really hope at least one of these is a red herring, if only for the show\u2019s dignity.)If you compare Mylod to someone like Miguel Sopochnik (who did Hardhome and the final two episodes of Season 6 \u2014 some of the finest hours that TV has ever seen), it\u2019s like an All-Pro against a journeyman.Thought #2: Are the showrunners about to pull a JJ Abrams?They only had seven episodes to produce this season, and they had an extra three months to do it. Yet we\u2019re almost at the halfway mark with little to show for it. I suppose the optimistic take is that what remains must be bonkers.My real concern, though, is that the lads in charge seem to be losing interest in the sorts of details that made this show great. The dialogue is still mostly sharp (when filmed well), but the plotholes and lazy oversights are mounting.Tyrion didn\u2019t happen to mention the tunnels to Dany until after the attack force had left? He saved that bit just for some B-movie exposition while we watch Casterly Rock fall in like 12 seconds of cut scenes? Then the whole Olenna recap? I understand budget constraints, but it felt like a bad Scooby Doo trope where the villain plays catch-up narrator.Why were troops sent to Casterly Rock in the first place? It offers negative strategic value (leaving it alone would keep some Lannister troops off the board, as they would never leave it totally undefended). Is Tyrion really that thick or are the writers just not checking their angles?I never watched Lost, but I was an Alias fan. And I remember the feeling when the show began going off the rails (fatigue mixed with Abrams and co. moving their attention to the next thing). Given Martin\u2019s stewardship, I doubt this will affect the ending here \u2014 but there does seem to be a lessening in the quality of thought put into how the final pieces are arranging themselves.Thought #3: Short takes about this week in acting.RIP Lady Olenna, the Lucille Bluth of Westeros. You died as you lived.Peter Dinklage is one of the finest actors at dialogue in the business. He always rises above his direction. The little inflections are just perfect.Davos is the earnest and lovable uncle we all didn\u2019t know we needed.Jonno\u2019s \u201cbut I\u2019m a sovereign citizen\u201d routine was adorable.Someone on Reddit pointed out that Bran seems like a guy who came back from Burning Man and hasn\u2019t slept it all off yet. 10/10.Speaking of Reddit, got a chuckle out of this gem:What was Littlefinger rambling on about anyway? Enemies from every dimension? Plan with quantum mechanics in mind? Sounded like the sort of thing a fedora-wearing teenager would write and think profound. Also, he probably has the thinnest plot armour left. He\u2019s going to scheme himself into the poor graces of two sisters who have grown pretty metal.Can we all admit that show Dany just isn\u2019t very interesting? Like, I\u2019m 100% behind strong female characters. Go feminism. But can you imagine sitting through dinner with her? She may be shrewd and good and all that, but a bit of personality that isn\u2019t grounded in her origin story would be nice.Another thing about Dany: every melodramatic speech she gives is laced with nonsense. \u201cI had faith in myself.\u201d U wot mate? You burned yourself alive with dragon eggs because you\u2019re all caught up on your Tony Robbins?At least Dany isn\u2019t as bad as Bran. He\u2019s been in a sled for months with nothing to do and he still couldn\u2019t figure out how to explain his new powers without creepily referencing the worst night of his sister\u2019s night? Yikes.\u201cWe\u2019re all children here.\u201d Jonno is right. No one on this show knows how to use their words to talk about their feelings. Everyone is a floundering mess of repression, projection, and unresolved identity issues.Oh, and speaking of children, this picture has been making the rounds. Was taken just a year before Season 1 was filmed. I\u2019ve looked at it like 2,308 times and I still can\u2019t get over how fast Robb and Jon did the whole Boyz 2 Men routine. Whoever did the casting is a wizard.Thought #4: The inscrutable desires of gods.The only really interesting thing to happen this episode (besides Jaime finding out that Tyrion was innocent) was the exchange between Melisandre and Varys.The Spider is a fascinating character. We know very little about him excepting what he\u2019s told us about himself \u2014 which given how often he\u2019s going on about mummers\u2019 tricks probably isn\u2019t very credible.But the Red Priestesses have his number somehow. Last night it was Mel with the cryptic line about them both dying in Westeros. But there was also that other scene from last season\u2026This all raises the question of what The Lord of Light really wants and what role Varys is meant to play in his plans.We don\u2019t know a lot about R\u2019hlor either, other than that he\u2019s not quite a passive deity. He wants something. As articulated by The Hound last week, Dondarrion was brought back for a reason. Same for Jon. And he seems to have a penchant for using messengers who\u2019ve lost their faith (Mel and Thoros).This is obviously really spinal to the show\u2019s grand narrative, but not in a way that\u2019s easy to parse. Maybe this is some sort of Abraham\u2019s Trial inversion, where the intended lesson is to say no when God demands something unethical? Maybe R\u2019hlor is actually trying to encourage people to rely more on moral skepticism and historically-informed wisdom and less on ambiguous voices?Whatever his endgame is, we\u2019ll find out soon enough. In the interim, we can ponder the implication of why Mel is returning to Volantis before she faces her presumed end in Westeros.Thought #5: The subtle genius of the saga.GRR Martin took Tolkien to task for building worlds that didn\u2019t include any consideration of economics \u2014 which he felt left them as more removed high fantasy than the sort of relevant history-fantasy hybrid he favoured.All that to say that the scenes with the bankers from Braavos have been a real strength of the show. Human history is largely a study in financial incentives and the decisions they inspire. That Martin understands this so clearly is a core part of what makes the show so worthy of our reflection.", "#718Spoilers Alert !!This was one of the best episode of the season so far, now the game is really started. No longer a one sided game.The key scenes I liked, Show starts with Jon landing in Draganstone.The scene with Tyrion and Jon is heartwarming. Its nice seeing these two together again. They mention the new scars they have saying a lot has changed since \u201cI saw you last pissing off the wall.\u201d When they are walking up towards Dragonstone and before the dragons swoop down Tyrion inquires about Sansa, assuring Jon the marriage was a farce and was unconsummated. He also says she is a lot more clever than she lets on, to which Jon replies \u201cShe's beginning to let on\u201d.Dragons swoop down. Tyrion : \u201cId say you get use to them, but you never really do.\u201dThe conversation between Varys and Melisandre plays out a bit differently. Varys clearly doesnt like her and doesnt buy her statment that she is done with whispering in King's ears. He mentions that to \u201cus commonfolk, tasting influence is like a lion tasting human flesh.\u201d She is going to the east but she will come back, which he mildly threatens that probably isnt a good idea for her sake. She responds saying she has to die in this strange land, as does he. She walks away and Varys is obviously left shaken a bit, since she just told him hes gonna die soon.So now the big scene of the episode is obviously the meeting between Jon and Dany. Honestly its a lot to take in theres a ton of back and forth between Dany and Jon with the odd time Tyrion chiming in as well as Davos. Biggest thing to take from this is Davos almost lets it slip that Jon came back from the dead saying he took a dagger to the heart for his people but Jon cuts him off. A later scene with Tyrion and Dany mentions some suspect to this, asking Tyrion what he thinks Davos meant by that. Tyrion is equally bewildered by it. The main thing is Dany is trying to strong arm Jon into kneeling and hes all like \u201cseriously, this game is bollocks we are all in grave danger because of the undead.\u201d she scoffs at it and they have a back and forth about their accomplishments in why they are where they are today. Dany retreads her entire journey we have watched up until now saying she survived it all because she had faith in Dany Targaryan not in myths and gods. Varys comes in an whispers about Eurons fleet and the greyjoys and snakes being killed or captured. Jon doesnt hear this but she offers them a room to stay the night. Jon asks if he is her prisoner.\u201cNot yet.\u201d she says.There\u2019s a quick scene of Theon being holstered up from the sea by a surviving Greyjoy boat (not Eurons). Captain shows up asks about Yara he tells her he got her couldnt save her he tried. Buddy says he wouldnt be here if he tried.The Euron scene. Euron parades the snakes in the streets. Gives the \u201cgift\u201d in the Iron Throne room. Cersei is like REALLY pleased. The sight of them in chains almost like it turns her on a bit. She tells Euron he will have whatever his heart desires... AFTER the war is won. This is when Euron asks Jaime for sex advice.Next is the dungeon scene where Cersei taunts Elianna and kisses her daughter and forces her to watch her daughter succumb to the poison which can take upwards of a day or two or even within the hour.Finally A Stark re-union.Next is the scene with Bran coming back to Winterfell. This is after Sansa is running around giving orders being a bossman, suggesting to one guy who is making armour why they aren\u2019t layered with leather since the weight and the fact its winter. Littlefinger takes her aside and they walk together hes doing his whole whispering in his ear type thing telling her to always think of every possible outcome for every possible situation therefore she will never be surprised and never caught offgaurd. Im pretty sure this quote is in one of the trailer.Then we get to Bran, he comes in on the back of a horsewagon of some sore. Something has clearly changed in Bran. He\u2019s almsot like a buddhist type monk now. Completely emotionless and all wise. Sansa is crying a bit but tears of joy. Next is at the Weirwood where Bran says he needs to see Jon. Bran brings up how pretty she looked on her wedding night in the woods. Said he is sorry for what happened to her. She gets up and leaves and is obviously disturbed by what just took place.Scene after that is the Jorah one in his cell. He is completely cured. The Arch Maester is obviously suspicious and knows Sam did something. He leaves and says Sam needs to see him later that evening. Sam says Jorahs father saved his life and it was the least he could do. He asks what he will do now. Obv Dany.Now we have the war room at dragonstone again with all the players their. Tyrion begins his explanation about the invasion of Casterly Rock. Scenes of the invasion its a massive invasion or front but Casterly rock holds. Tyrion mentions as this is happening is that Casterly rock is more or less impossible to penetrate head on. but he made secret tunnles for his whores back in the day through the sewers to sneak them in.The Casterly rock invasion is actually the second last scene, and is narrated by Tyrion as its going down. He's essentially describing the battle as its happening. There\u2019s an epic battle that focuses on Grey Worm as he\u2019s explaining. Grey worm throws a spear at a lannister soldier that sends him 15 feet into a wall. Its dope.However as the battle finishes and Grey Worm and everyone is celebrating the victory grey worm is bit suspicious. He\u2019s all like \u201cThere should be more of them\u201d Then they get up at the top and look to the sea nad Eurons fleet is attacking Dany's and destroying the fuck out of it.Next scene is the aftermath of HighGarden battle. Jaime is marching upstairs to Olenna whos in her room. She knows her time is up. They have an exchange, says Joffrey was such a cunt. She asks how she will go. He mention\u2019s Cersei wants her flayed in public, paraded around the streets. He tells Olenna he convinced her not to do those things. She asks will it be painful, he says no. Pours a glass of wine for the two of them. He puts poison in hers. SHE GULPS IT RIGHT AWAY. Its after she gulps it our Olenna gets the last laugh. She describes Joffrey\u2019s death graphicly. Telling Jaime how hard it must have been to see his son die like that. Then she says she made it so because she wasn\u2019t sure if it actually would of worked. She wasn\u2019t disappointed. She says \u201cHe was a monster, just like his mother, and she will be the end of you.\u201dOkaaaay so alot to take in and there is another scene where Dany and Tyrion are together alone in the war room where she asks advice in how to deal with Jon. Nothing really knew but I can elaborate if need be. Most important thing is she is suspicious about what Davos said about taking a knife to his heart for his people.There\u2019s also the two other smaller scenes where Tyrion and Jon talk to each other at the edge of a cliff. And the scene where Jon comes to Dany as she is watching her dragons and she gives him permission to mine the dragonglass.Oh also, its the scene with Tyrion and Dany that convinces Dany to give him the dragonglass. The logic behind it is if Jon is busy mining dragonglass and fighting an enemy, even if its an imaginary one, it doesn\u2019t matter because he isn\u2019t rallying to go against Dany, so its probably better to extend an olive branch, create a relationship and keep him distracted so hes not focused and battling Dany.Overall, I liked this episode, the only thing I miss was Arya.Madhav Matle"]}, "64": {"id": "s07e04", "name": "The Spoils of War", "script": "(GRUNTING)  I lost this dagger.

Come on, you can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls  before saying goodbye?  I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.  There is no more High Septon.  No, there isn't, is there?  There is still the question of my prize.  That's a lot of money I just gave you.  It's not a castle.  How about that one? It's available.  You don't want Highgarden.  - I beg to differ. - We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you owe, the more it weighs you down.  Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?  - Man: Move out! - Jaime: They're not mine.  This all belongs to the Iron Bank.  See? We pay our debts.  Right, just not to me.  Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of  whatever nameless shit heap you're from  with a saddlebag full of gold,  complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war,  all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms  will be yours to choose from,  with no one left to take them away from you.  Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign  will be quiet and peaceable.  Ah, stranger things have happened.  Like what?  The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.  - The current harvest? - We have teams of men collecting it  from all the farms in the Reach.  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys  and help them accelerate this process?  I'm not much for shoveling wheat.  No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest--  I bet you're going to have a real talent for that.  My lord.  My lord.  My lord.  Tycho: I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank  has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man,  but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.  You're too kind, my lord.  I am neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent.  Its well-being is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.  - Uh, the gold - Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.  Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.  Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance  in some current venture.  My only venture at this moment  is reestablishing control over this continent  and every person on it.  I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine it would require outside investment.  It will, indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.  I know them well.  They have helped us recover significant sums  from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.  That's good to hear.  I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.  Rest assured, Your Grace,  you can count on the Iron Bank's support.  - Hmm. - As soon as the gold arrives.

The other dagger,  the one that took her life,  I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart  if I could have.  I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.  But I am here for her now  to do what she would have done,  to protect her children.  Anything I can do for you, Brandon,  you need only ask.  Do you know who this belonged to?  No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home,  driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.  To go through all of that and make your way home again  only to find such chaos in the world,  I can only imagine--  Chaos is a ladder.  ( door opens )  ( exhales )  I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.  I'm not Lord Stark.  What's that?  Maester Wolkan built it for me  so I can move around more easily.  It's a very good idea.  You're leaving.  I don't want to leave you,  but when-- when they come,  I need to be with my family.  And you're safe.  Well, as safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore.  No, I don't.  That's all you've got to say?  Thank you.  Thank you?  For helping me.  My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  - Bran - I'm not, really.  Not anymore.  ( crying )  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark,  but I remember so much else now.  You died in that cave.  I did.  The kitchen girl, the redhead with the behind.  The only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver.  'Ey up. Where you going?  In there. I live here.  ( snickers ) Fuck off.  I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.  ( Henk snorts )  Arya Stark's dead.  Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrick.  - They'll tell you who I am. - There's no Rodrick here.  Maester's named Wolkan.  Go ask Jon Snow, then, the King in the North.  - He's my brother. - He's a thousand miles away.  Look, it's cold and we're busy,  - so, you know, best fuck off. - Mm.  If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?  The Lady of Winterfell. Lady Stark.  - Which Lady Stark? - Henk: You tell us.  You're the one impersonating her sister.  Tell Sansa her sister's home.  Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us.  So, for the last time, fuck off.  ( grunts )  I'm getting into this castle one way or another.  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.  But if I am and Sansa finds out you turned me away  Right, you sit there.  Right there.  Don't move.  Right, go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.  Henk: I ain't telling Lady Stark. You can tell her.  Koner: Why me?  - Henk: You're gonna tell her. - I'm not.  'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face  as hard as I can.  Koner: We told her to wait.  ( sighs ) We were standing right next to her, and  And-- and when we turned around, she'd gone, my lady.  She-- she was nothing. Some winter town girl.  She comes in asking for, uh, Ser Rodrick  - Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah. - and Maester Luwin.  ( Henk stammering ) And don't trouble yourself over it, my lady.  - We'll-- we'll find her. - You don't have to.  I know where she is.  ( fire crackling )  ( chain rattling )  Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?  Yes.  You shouldn't have run from the guards.  I didn't run.  You need better guards.  ( chuckles )  It suits you Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?  He did.  I hope he comes back soon.  I remember how happy he was to see me.  When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.  ( chuckles )  It doesn't look like him.  Should've been carved by someone who knew his face.  Everyone who knew his face is dead.  We're not.  They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?  I wish I had.  Hmm. Me, too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got, he was always first.  Your list?  Of people I'm going to kill.  How did you get back to Winterfell?  It's a long story.  I imagine yours is, too.  Yes.  Not a very pleasant one.  Mine neither.  But our stories aren't over yet.  No, they're not.  Arya  Bran's home, too.  ( crows cawing )  You came home.  I saw you at the crossroads.  You saw me?  I see quite a lot now.  Bran has visions.  I thought you might go to King's Landing.  So did I.  Why would you go back there?  Cersei's on her list of names.  Who else is on your list?  Most of them are dead already.  Where did you get this?  Littlefinger gave it to me.  Littlefinger? He's here?  He has declared for House Stark.  Why would he give you a dagger?  - He thought I'd want it. - Sansa: Why?  Because it was meant to kill me.  The cutthroat after your fall?  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?  Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.  He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything  unless he thought he was getting something back.  - It doesn't matter. - What do you mean it doesn't matter?  I don't want it.  Are you sure?  Arya: It's Valyrian steel.  It's wasted on a cripple.  ( people chattering )  ( bleating )  Catelyn Stark would be proud.  You kept your vow.  I did next to nothing.  You're too hard on yourself, my lady.  I'm not a  Thank you, Podrick.  ( raven cawing )  ( waves crashing )  Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.  Soon.  He will come back to you.  He'd better.  What happened?  Many things.  Many things?  - ( sighs ) - Jon: Your Grace.    ( seagulls screeching )  I wanted you to see it  before we start hacking it to bits.  Well, this is it. All we'll ever need.  There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.  The children of the forest made these.  When?  A very long time ago.  They were right here,  standing where we're standing.  Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.  No.  They were here together, the children and the First Men.  Doing what? Fighting each other?  They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.  Together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive.  Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.  And you say you can't defeat them  without my armies and my dragons?  No, I don't think I can.  I will fight for you.  I will fight for the North.  When you bend the knee.  My people  won't accept a southern ruler.  Not after everything they've suffered.  They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?  What is it?  We took Casterly Rock.  That's very good to hear.  Isn't it?  You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  - Perhaps-- - You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.  - You still have the largest armies. - Who won't be able to eat  because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.  Tyrion: Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  - We have a plan. It's still the right plan. - The right plan!  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.  - If I have underestimated our enemies-- - Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.  ( dragons screeching )  Enough with the clever plans.  I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.  We've discussed this.  My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?  A smart one.  What do you think I should do?  - I would never presume to-- - I'm at war.  I'm losing.  What do you think I should do?  Jon: I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you  know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe  that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different  from the shit one they've always known.  But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities,  you're not different.  You're just more of the same.  ( dragons screeching )  ( both grunting )  - ( huffs ) - Don't lunge.  ( grunting )  Don't go where your enemy leads you.  Brienne: Up.  - And don't-- - Don't fight someone like her in the first place.  Nice sword.  Very nice dagger.  If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores,  then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.  We can't  It's been a while since I trained.  I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.  He didn't beat the Hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.  You swore to serve both my mother's daughters,  didn't you?  Brienne: Move aside, Podrick.  You can't use that, my lady. It's too small.  I won't cut you. Don't worry.  I'll try not to.  ( grunting )  ( grunts, shouts )  - ( shouting ) - ( grunts )  ( grunts )  ( exhales )  Who taught you how to do that?  No one.  ( waves crashing )  ( seagulls screeching )  - Davos: What do you think of her? - Who?  ( sighs ) I believe you know of whom I speak.  I think she has a good heart.  A good heart?  I've noticed you staring at her good heart.  There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the North to fight him?  10,000? Less?  - Fewer. - What?  Speaking of good hearts-- Missandei of Naath.  Ser Davos, Lord Snow.  King Snow, isn't it?  No, that doesn't sound right.  - King Jon? - It doesn't matter.  Forgive me, but may I ask a question?  Of course.  Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?  I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.  Is the custom different in Naath?  We don't have marriage in Naath,  so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.  That sounds liberating.  Why did you leave your homeland?  I was stolen away by slavers.  I'm sorry.  If I may, how did a slave girl  come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?  She bought me from my master and set me free.  Davos: That was good of her.  Of course, you're serving her now, aren't you?  I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.  And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?  Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.  You believe that?  I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos,  we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter  of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose.  Will you forgive me if I switch sides?  ( bell ringing )  Jon: Is that a Greyjoy ship?  ( men shouting )  ( man shouts )  Man: Halt!  Jon.  I didn't know you were here.  S-Sansa  is she all right?  What you did for her  is the only reason I'm not killing you.  We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.  I should be.  Davos: Your sister?  Euron has her.  I came to ask the queen to help me get her back.  The queen is gone.  Where did she go?  - Man: Get the horses watered! - ( neighs )  ( chatter )  All the gold's safely through the gates of King's Landing.  Good.  We need to get the last of these wagons  over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.  The head of the line is ambushed,  the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.  Well, we are stretched a bit thin.  With your permission,  flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.  Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.  - ( men grunting ) - Man: Now, get it on this thing.  - Man #2: Lift! - ( men laughing )  - Ser Jaime. - Rickon.  Dickon.  I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.  Your first battle?  And?  It was glorious.  Come on, your father's not here.  All my life, we've been pledged to House Tyrell.  I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.  They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray her queen  and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.  I didn't expect it to smell like that.  Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?  Well, I learned it when I was five.  ( distant horse neighs )  What?  Listen.  ( distant hoofbeats approaching )  ( rumbling )  Jaime: Spears and shields! Spears and shields!  - What is it? - Bronn: Get in line!  Spears and shields! Spears and shields!  Get in line now!

Summary At Winterfell At Winterfell, Littlefinger meets with the recently-returned Bran Stark. Apparently hoping to exploit disunity among the Stark children, he tries to ingratiate himself with Bran, Ned Stark's last trueborn son and rightful heir to Winterfell. Littlefinger gives Bran a gift, the very same Valyrian steel dagger that a cutthroat tried to kill him with while he was in a coma right after he was pushed from one of Winterfell's towers. Bran is still emotionally detached, however, from all of his visions as the new Three-Eyed Raven, and is generally uninterested, only absentmindedly asking who the dagger belonged to. With a wry look, Littlefinger responds that, in a way, this is the question which started the entire War of the Five Kings. Bran's mother Catelyn Stark took the dagger south with her to King's Landing to try to find who it belonged to, convinced the Lannisters sent the cutthroat to kill Bran (and left it there in Ned's possession, from whom Littlefinger recovered it). Littlefinger tries to manipulate Bran by remarking on how much chaos he must have lived through to get back to Winterfell. In response, Bran looks at Littlefinger and says, \"Chaos is a ladder,\" quoting back Littlefinger's own words to him, which Littlefinger said to Varys in King's Landing years before and which Bran couldn't possibly have been physically present to hear himself. Visibly unnerved, Littlefinger is startled by Meera Reed entering the room. He takes his leave of Bran, calling him \"Lord Stark\", though again Bran insists he's not a Lord.  After Littlefinger leaves, Meera notices Bran's new wheelchair. He explains Maester Wolkan built it for him. She tells him that she has come to tell him she's leaving and say goodbye; she promised to keep him safe, and now that he's back in Winterfell surrounded by his Stark forces, he's as safe as anyone will be before the coming war. Meera explains that when the White Walkers arrive, she wants to be with her family, so she is heading back to the Neck to assist the Crannogmen. She says he doesn't need her in Winterfell anymore; Bran agrees with her and with blank emotional affect, simply thanking her for her help. Meera becomes angry that this is all he has to say after everything they went through, when Hodor and Summer and even her own brother Jojen died for Bran. Bran responds that he isn't really \"Bran Stark\" anymore, but the Three-Eyed Raven. He \"remembers\" the events of Bran Stark's life, but now \"remembers\" vast amounts of other accumulated memories from centuries upon centuries. Everything that once affected \"Bran Stark\" now seems distant and trivial to him. In horror, Meera cries that he \"died\" in the cave and leaves.  Meanwhile, Arya Stark finally returns to Winterfell, after leaving years before with her father, Sansa, and King Robert Baratheon's entourage, right after Bran's fall from the tower. Arya rides up to the gates and dismounts, but the guards don't believe her when she says she is in fact Arya Stark, convinced that Arya has been dead for years. Arya asks that they send word to Maester Luwin and Rodrik Cassel, hoping either can prove her identity but unaware they are both dead. The guards gruffly say that no one by those names is there, so Arya asks for Jon. The two say he'd just left Winterfell. Arya asks who is in charge of Winterfell then, and they say \"Lady Stark\" (who Arya realizes is her sister). They try to brush her aside, but she dodges them with her assassin's reflexes, and insists that one way or another, she's getting in. She explains to them that if she is Arya, they'll be in a lot of trouble for turning her away, and if she isn't, she won't last long in Winterfell anyway. Mildly concerned, they agree to at least let her in the courtyard but insist that she stay put while they consult Sansa so they can disprove her identity. As soon as they take their eyes off her, however, she slips away. The two guards go to inform Sansa and try to wave it aside as just some impostor, but when they mention she asked for Luwin and Cassel, she instantly realizes it must be Arya, and already knows where she has gone.  Sansa finds Arya where she expected, in the crypts looking over their father Ned's grave. They are happy to see each other but so much has happened to both of them in the past few years that they are at first awkward, unsure of what to say. Arya asks if she has to call Sansa \"Lady Stark\" now, to which Sansa firmly insists yes, and laughs. They smile and hug, though still a bit unsure. Arya notes that Jon left her in charge and smiles when Sansa says that she hopes Jon will be back soon. He will be both surprised and happy to see Arya, Sansa remembering how happy Jon was to see her when they were reunited. The sisters then look sadly on their father's grave statue. Arya says it doesn't really look like him. Sansa acknowledges that everyone who knew his face well is dead. Arya points out they're not.  Arya then asks if Sansa killed Joffrey as everyone believes. She explains she actually didn't, though she wished she had. Arya remarks that he was always at the top of her \"list\". This confuses Sansa, and Arya explains that she'd been keeping a list of everyone she was going to kill, at which they both laugh. Finally, Sansa asks how Arya got back, but she only says her road wasn't a pleasant one. Sansa says hers wasn't either. They hug again, earnestly and warmly. Sansa then informs Arya that Bran is home too. Arya is elated, but her face falls when Sansa makes no mention of Rickon, immediately realizing that Rickon is dead.  Sansa brings Arya to Bran in the Godswood, where he is lost in thought by the Weirwood heart tree. Arya is saddened to see him so paralyzed. Still somewhat detached even at the sight of Arya, he says he isn't surprised she's alive because he saw her at the Crossroads. Arya is confused, and Sansa explains that Bran is having \"visions\" now. Bran says he thought Arya was going to King's Landing, and when Sansa asks why she would head there of all places, he again startles them both by saying it's because Cersei is on her list of names (which he can't possibly be aware of through normal means). Sansa asks who else is on her list, but she says most of them besides Cersei are actually dead already.  They then remark on the Valyrian steel dagger in his lap, and he explains that Littlefinger gave it to him, thinking he'd want it. Despite it being such a horrible keepsake that nearly killed him and indirectly set off a chain of events leading to his parents' deaths, he is still listless and disinterested in it. Arya is confused as to why a common cutthroat would have a rare, priceless blade of Valyrian steel. Bran matter-of-factly says that someone very wealthy wanted him dead, and gave it to the assassin. Sansa acknowledges she doesn't actually trust Littlefinger and he'd never give anyone anything unless expecting something in return.  Sansa Arya Bran TSOW Ned and Catelyn Stark's surviving children are reunited.  Bran says that doesn't matter, because he doesn't even want it. Instead, Bran hands it to Arya and says she can have it, saying the dagger would be \"wasted on a cripple\". Arya slowly takes the dagger and looks at it.  Sansa, Bran, and Arya - the three remaining trueborn Stark children - proceed back to Winterfell's castle courtyard together, with Arya pushing Bran in his wheelchair. Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne see them from afar, all three of Catelyn Stark's surviving children reunited. Pod says Catelyn would be proud of Brienne, but she chides that she did next to nothing. Pod says he disagrees with \"my lady\", and Brienne starts to correct him that she doesn't consider herself a \"lady\", but then stops halfway and just thanks him for the compliment.  Some time later, Brienne is going through a vigorous sword practice session with Podrick, knocking him down when he overextends himself. Impressed, Arya interrupts and says she'd like to spar with Brienne, the woman who beat the Hound in combat. Sansa and Littlefinger watch on silently from the walkway above. Brienne goes easy on her at first, but then Arya completely outmaneuvers Brienne using the Water Dance training she received from Syrio Forel, augmented by her training with the Faceless Men. Arya achieves many openings that would be a killing blow if she wanted them to be. Surprised that such a young girl is so skilled, Brienne stops holding back, leading to a more grueling sparring session. Brienne actually manages to knock Needle out of Arya's hand but she simply switches to the Valyrian steel dagger she had in her belt. Arya uses her speed and agility to compensate for Brienne's strength and size to overwhelm her - until Brienne actually manages to bring her brute strength to bear on a fast moving target by landing a kick on Arya's chest that sends her falling down. Ultimately, they reach a stalemate, with each of them holding a blade at the others' throat. Brienne asks Arya who taught her to fight like that, and she simply responds, \"no one\". Arya takes her leave of Brienne, both mutually impressed, as Sansa looks down baffled and concerned at how her sister reached such a deadly skill level. Arya herself then glares at an equally surprised Littlefinger.  In King's Landing Tycho-Cersei-Spoils-of-War Cersei meets with Tycho Nestoris again, to discuss paying off the throne's debts to the Iron Bank, and hiring the Golden Company.  In King's Landing, Queen Cersei Lannister is happy to learn of the gold taken from the Sack of Highgarden. The Lannister army at Highgarden is currently transporting the gold ahead to the capital, though it remains in the north of the Reach seizing grain supplies.  Cersei meets with Tycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank of Braavos in her atrium containing a large floor map of Westeros. Tycho is pleased that Cersei will use the captured gold to pay off the Iron Throne's massive debts to the bank, and he engages in overt flattery by saying that she is as cunning at military strategy as her father Tywin was, if not more so.  Now that the Lannisters' old debts will be mostly paid off, and the Iron Bank's faith in them somewhat reassured by their recent military victories, Cersei wants to take out new loans to strengthen her position in the war, so she can finish securing control over the rest of the continent. They discuss that Cersei wants to use the money to hire foreign Sellsword companies to bolster the depleted Lannister military ranks. Specifically, she reveals that she has had Qyburn make overtures to hire the best and largest private mercenary army in all of the Free Cities: the Golden Company. Tycho assures her that the Iron Bank will be delighted to help her with these future endeavors, once it receives the gold she is bringing them.  On Dragonstone Daenerys-Missandei-Spoils-of-War-2 Daenerys enquires into Missandei's relationship with Grey Worm.  On Dragonstone, Daenerys Targaryen and Missandei make their way down to the beach to meet Jon Snow. Missandei is worried about Grey Worm because they haven't heard any news from Casterly Rock yet. Daenerys asks what happened between her and Grey Worm, and Missandei wryly says \"many things\", smiling. Jon then leads Daenerys on a tour of the long-abandoned Valyrian dragonglass mine that Samwell Tarly told him about. The mine is ancient and impressive, used by the First Men long before the Valyrians came to Dragonstone. But this is not why Jon asked Daenerys to come.  As they proceed deeper into the mines led by torchlight, Jon shows her cave paintings they discovered left behind by the Children of the Forest, filled with arcane magical symbols. Daenerys is stunned that the mythical Children stood where they are standing now, thousands upon thousands of years ago, long before mankind ever arrived in Westeros. Jon says this isn't exactly true, leading her into another chamber, this one filled with narrative drawings of the Children and the First Men. Daenerys wonders if the Children and First Men fought each other, but Jon then shows her ancient carvings of the White Walkers themselves, one of which Jon recognizes as an image of the Night King. Jon explains that the Children of the Forest and the First Men only managed to drive off the White Walkers the first time during the Long Night because they chose to join together to fight off their own extinction, and that is the choice between Jon and Daenerys now.  Jon asks Daenerys to ally with him to defeat the Night King. When Daenerys says that she will fight for him and the North after he bends the knee, Jon tells her that the North won't accept a southern ruler again after everything that has happened to them. Daenerys urges that they will if their king does. If his point in showing her the cave drawings was that she should swallow her pride and ally with him because the White Walkers are such a world-ending threat, by the same token, the North should submit to her, because their survival should outweigh their pride.  Daenerys-Jon-Varys-Missandei-Tyrion-Spoils-of-War Hearing of the military disaster at the Sack of Highgarden, Daenerys and her allies argue about what to do next.  As they exit the cave to the beach, they are joined by Varys and Tyrion, with grave looks on their faces. They inform her that the Unsullied succeeded in capturing Casterly Rock, only to then reveal the disaster which just occurred at Highgarden as Tyrion's military strategy fell apart. Casterly Rock was only a feint and the Lannisters didn't bother defending it, in order to make a surprise attack south which sacked Highgarden. Daenerys is furious and struggles to keep her temper, as now all three of her major allies in Westeros are gone and all she has gained is a castle with no supplies. She snaps at Tyrion, blaming his cautious strategy for losing them Dorne, the Iron Islands (Yara's forces), and now the Reach. She then accuses Tyrion of wanting to use a light hand against the Lannisters because they're his own people. Tyrion insists that they still have just enough ships left to at least shuttle the Dothraki from Dragonstone to the nearby mainland coast; even with the loss of all her other allies, her combined Unsullied/Dothraki forces are still the largest single army in Westeros. Daenerys fumes that her vast numbers are useless if she can't feed them all, as that was the Reach's true strategic value. Daenerys decides she has had enough of clever plans, and will use the Dothraki and her dragons in a direct assault to turn the tide of the war back in her favor. She desires to assault the Red Keep with all three of her dragons, intending to raze it to the ground with all her enemies inside it, but Jon argues against such a course of action when she asks him his opinion; by bringing dragons back to life and breaking the back of the slave trade, Daenerys has proven she might be capable of doing things differently. However, if she uses her dragons to \"melt castles and burn cities\", she will be no different from any of the more tyrannical of her Targaryen ancestors who came before her.  Later, Jon and Davos Seaworth proceed back up to the castle. Davos remarks that Jon seems attracted to Daenerys. Jon says Daenerys has a good heart but brushes Davos' observation aside, saying he doesn't \"have time for that\" as he has seen the Night King and his horde of the undead. Jon stresses that they need to ally with Daenerys, because the North itself is largely depleted of soldiers after so many years of war (and the Red Wedding), so they only have maybe 10,000 soldiers or less left (to which Davos corrects \"fewer\").  They then run into Missandei again, who politely enquires why Jon's surname is \"Snow\" even though House Stark has ruled the North for centuries, and his father Ned and brother Robb both had the surname \"Stark\", while he doesn't. Jon explains that because his parents weren't married, he is bastard-born as a result and uses the regional surname 'Snow' - the name reserved for highborn Northern bastards of nobility. Davos asks Missandei if they have similar customs for bastards on Naath, Missandei's birthplace. Missandei explains that \"Marriage\" as such does not exist in Naath, so she finds the idea of a \"bastard\" to be quite an alien concept. Davos remarks that it sounds liberating. He then asks why she left, to which Missandei finally reveals that she was taken by slavers, to be freed only years later by Daenerys. When Davos suggests Missandei simply traded one master for another, she counters that she and all the freed slaves serve Daenerys because they choose to. Davos keeps pushing, asking what would happen if Missandei decided to return to Naath immediately. She responds that Daenerys would give her a ship and wish her good fortune.  704 Jon &amp; Theon Promo Jon confronts Theon, sparing him only for rescuing Sansa from Ramsay Bolton  While they are still on the causeway, they see a lone ironborn ship approaching the island, a survivor of Yara Greyjoy's fleet. Theon Greyjoy himself and some of his men come to shore on a rowboat. As Theon disembarks, he is stunned to see Jon Snow, whom he had had last seen leaving Winterfell to join the Night's Watch. Since then, Theon had betrayed House Stark, a factor (albeit not the only one) that nearly destroyed House Stark and contributed to the deaths of two of Jon's half-brothers, Robb and Rickon. Jon is stunned for a moment as well. Theon walks up to Jon and asks him if Sansa, Jon's half-sister, is all right. A furious Jon angrily grabs Theon by his coat and shakes him, remembering Theon's past treachery. Jon tells Theon that what he did to save Sansa is the only reason that he is not killing him on the spot and releases him. Visibly relieved, Theon informs them that Euron Greyjoy attacked their fleet and took Yara prisoner. He says he has returned to ask Daenerys's help in saving her. Jon grudgingly tells him that Daenerys has just left.  In the Reach At Highgarden, Jaime Lannister coordinates the soldiers loading up the spoils of war for transport. The Sack of Highgarden allowed them to seize all of House Tyrell's substantial gold stores, which they send ahead to King's Landing first, before moving on to securing grain shipments. Jaime procures a large bag of gold coins and gives it to Bronn as payment for his services. Bronn, however, is annoyed that this isn't the full reward he was promised, which included a wife from the nobility and a castle. He then half-seriously asks why Jaime doesn't just grant him Highgarden, as they need someone to rule it. Jaime replies that they are at war, Highgarden requires significant upkeep, and Daenerys could arrive at any moment to take it. When Bronn remarks on the riches Jaime is packing up, Jaime says they are not his and the gold will be used to repay the Iron Bank. Bronn is not satisfied and Jaime says when they win the war, Bronn can choose from any castle he likes. He has Bronn assist Randyll Tarly and Dickon Tarly continue seizing grain supplies in the northern Reach.  Some time later, Jaime's Lannister army has advanced much farther north, and reaches the Blackwater Rush. Lord Randyll Tarly comes to Jaime and says they should hurry to get all of their grain wagons over the Blackwater river to King's Landing, as they will be vulnerable if their formation is caught on both sides of the river. Jaime agrees, but Randyll suggests flogging the stragglers to motivate them. Jaime urges that his soldiers fought well at Highgarden, however, and he should at least give them a fair warning first instead of launching right into the flogging. Jaime and Bronn then encounter Randyll's son Dickon Tarly again. Jaime asks what he thought of his first taste of battle, and Dickon nervously claims it was glorious, only to then dejectedly admit that he was quite conflicted. House Tarly had been loyal vassals of the Tyrells for generations; he knew many of the men they killed, even hunted side by side with them. Jaime replies those men didn't deserve to die but says the fault belongs to Olenna Tyrell because she choose to side with Daenerys Targaryen against Queen Cersei. Dickon then outright confesses that the aftermath was horrible, particularly the stench of corpses. Bronn playfully taunts that Dickon, a sheltered nobleman, finally learned that men empty their bowels when they die.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 1 Daenerys's huge Dothraki horde descends on Jaime's Lannister army, in the Battle of the Goldroad.  The Lannister army and wagon train continue east, approaching a river. Jaime and Bronn are then surprised to hear what sounds like distant thunder, until they realize it must be approaching cavalry. Jaime and Randyll shout for their soldiers to form up, which they manage to do before the enemy crests over the horizon: a massive, 100,000-strong horde of Dothraki cavalry, armed to the teeth and baying for blood. Bronn advises that Jaime ride ahead to King's Landing, but Jaime insists he will not abandon his men. Bronn bluntly tells him the Dothraki will quickly overwhelm the Lannister lines and Jaime is too valuable as a commander to stay and fight, but Jaime insists that they have a chance if they hold.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 5 The mobile Dothraki light cavalry race through the hole made in the Lannister lines to start enveloping them.  704 Battle of Tumbleton Promo Lannister heavy infantry rally around Jaime and Randyll, and a fierce melee ensues.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 6 Daenerys switches to making strafing runs with her dragon, across the Lannister formations.  In an instant, Jaime and Bronn look to the sky in awe and horror as all other sound is drowned out by a massive roar, a roar not heard on the battlefields of Westeros in over a century and a half. Above the approaching Dothraki the Lannister army sees a huge adult dragon part the cloud cover itself and heading straight for their lines: Drogon, ridden by Daenerys Targaryen herself. Drogon outpaces the Dothraki, and at Daenerys's command \"Dracarys\", he blasts a torrent of fire through the Lannister ranks in a straight line from front to back, punching a hole in their formation. The highly mobile Dothraki light cavalry immediately sweep through it and wheel around to catch those parts of the Lannister lines in an enveloping move.  The Lannister-Tarly lines around Jaime and Randyll, however, manage to rally under their leadership. The Dothraki charge into the Lannister lines head-on, but meet stiff resistance as their spear wall holds firm. Though they are outnumbered, the Lannister soldiers are better armed with heavy infantry, and highly disciplined, battle-hardened veterans from years of war. Dothraki horse-archers let off shots before charging into their ranks, but highly-trained Tarly archers return fire, doing as much if not more damage, as the Dothraki wear less armor.  The Lannister army holds their line for a time, but their enemy has the advantage of weight in numbers, and the tide turns slowly against them. The sheer tide of horses smashes through the shield wall, opening up gaps for those behind to charge through. For a moment it looks like Jaime might at least be able to force the Dothraki to a standstill - but then Daenerys wheels out of the air again, devastating the Lannister formations. No longer trying to punch mere holes through their lines, she switches to outflanking the Lannister ranks, burning a vast horizontal swath of men from left to right, obliterating much of the Lannister wagon train in the process. Men are flash-burned into nothing but ash which crumbles to the touch, or cooked alive in their own superheated armor as they struggle to rip it off, dousing themselves in the river.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 7 Jaime rallies Lannister & Tarly archers to shoot volleys at the dragon, but in vain.  Nonetheless, Jaime manages to rally his remaining forces a second time, desperately taking command of a group of surviving Lannister and Tarly archers and directing them to concentrate their fire at the dragon: Drogon might not be vulnerable to common arrow fire, but his rider is. If they can manage to kill Daenerys herself, who has risked appearing in open battle, the entire war could end in a day, no matter their losses. Daenerys sees the attack coming, however, and banks Drogon up so the arrow volley harmlessly bounces off the armored scales on his belly. He then blasts the archer formations with fire. Jaime avoids the flames and is surrounded by enemies, but he manages to carve a path through the Dothraki with his Valyrian steel sword Widow's Wail to try to reach safety. He gets in trouble for a moment when he locks swords with a Dothraki duel-wielding two arakhs, but Dickon Tarly stabs the Dothraki from behind, saving Jaime.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 12 Bronn loads up the anti-dragon scorpion, and takes aim at Daenerys.  Jaime commands Bronn to reach Qyburn's anti-dragon scorpion-bolt launcher (as Jaime cannot fire it one-handed), which they happen to have on hand and which was one of the few wagons not destroyed in the flames. After a moment's hesitation, Bronn fights his way back, killing several Dothraki until one cuts off his horse's leg and sends him sprawling, losing his large bag of gold in the process. Bronn continues to fight his way back on foot, chased by the same Dothraki warrior, who follows him into the wagon he was looking for, just in time to stare down the business-end of the loaded scorpion. He barely has time to realize his fate before Bronn fires a bolt into him, flinging him twenty feet and pinning his corpse to another wagon. Bronn reloads the scorpion as fast as he can (it is meant to be crewed by a team of men), spots the dragon in the distance, and fires, but misses. Daenerys is startled by the scorpion-bolt flying a few feet from her head, scans the battlefield, and spots Bronn on the scorpion as he reloads.  Enraged at this direct attack on Drogon, Daenerys then leads Drogon on a direct charge diving straight down at Bronn on the scorpion launcher, who waits for her to approach close enough that he hopefully won't miss before she is right on top of him. He fires another shot, which impales Drogon's right shoulder. The mighty dragon lets out an awful screech and collapses in shock, helplessly dropping into a free-fall from hundreds of feet in the air.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 13 Only receiving a flesh wound from the scorpion bolt in his shoulder, Drogon roasts the scorpion as Bronn jumps away.  Bronn is elated, only for Daenerys to quickly break Drogon out of his fall right before they hit the ground, which would have killed them both. The surviving Lannister soldiers then realize that not only is the dragon not dead, he is in a lot of pain and extremely angry. Hovering above the river, Drogon sets his sights on the device which did this to him and angrily sends a fire-blast at the scorpion, destroying it a matter of seconds after Bronn narrowly jumps out of the way to safety.  The dragon's armored scales are so tough that the scorpion bolt only managed to cause superficial damage. Nonetheless, the flesh wound grounds Drogon, and he howls in pain and fury, destroying any masses of enemy soldiers that are foolish or unlucky enough to get near him. Daenerys dismounts and desperately tries to remove the scorpion bolt.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 9 The battle turns into an utter rout, as the Lannister army is overwhelmed by the Dothraki and dragon-fire.  By this point, the devastation caused by the dragon and the sheer number of Dothraki have totally overwhelmed the Lannister lines, and with the scorpion destroyed, their last hope is gone and the battle turns into an utter rout and massacre. The Dothraki, who live for combat, show the fleeing Westerosi no mercy and cut them down gleefully on and off horseback. Tyrion Lannister views the battle from the distance of a nearby hill, along with the Dothraki commander Qhono, who remarks that Tyrion's people can't fight. Tyrion looks gravely on the battlefield, realizing that these are in fact his own countrymen from the Westerlands and House Lannister being massacred, men who Tyrion had previously fought alongside at the Battles of the Green Fork and Blackwater. Many burning and dying men rush to the river to try to extinguish the flames.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 14 Jaime makes a death-run at Daenerys and her downed dragon, charging through the devastation of the battlefield.  704 Battle of Tumbleton 15 Jaime reaches Daenerys, but Drogon defends his mother.  Jaime, however, sees that Daenerys is grounded and immobilized, and realizes he still has one chance; if he can kill Daenerys, even now, he can end her invasion. Jaime grabs a spear and charges his horse across the flaming battlefield to make a death-run for Daenerys as she tends to her dragon. Tyrion swears under his breath, calling his brother a \"fucking idiot\", angry that he's going to get himself killed.  Just as Jaime is nearly on top of Daenerys, however, Drogon notices him amidst the chaos of the battle. Shielding Daenerys behind his head, the dragon opens his mouth and his throat glows with the promise of fiery death. Just as Drogon unleashes the flames, Bronn rides in and tackles Jaime off his horse, leaving their poor mounts to be consumed instead. They both fall into the river, where Jaime is weighed down by his armor, and sinks beneath the waters, in danger of drowning."], "review": ["GAME OF THRONES SEASON 7 EPISODE 4 (THE SPOILS OF WAR)Jaime is disturbed by the revelation that Olenna Tyrell killed Joffrey. Also, he can now be sure that Tyrion had nothing to do with Joffrey\u2019s murder. This and Tyrion\u2019s obvious concern for his brother in the ending scence reveal that the show is trying to emotionally reconnect the brothers.Bronn and Jaime arguing is golden\u2026 like two teenagers fighting for their crush!Tarly father-and-son approach them at the same time when Bronn and Jaime discuss stranger things. Tarly disloyal? Hi-hu-ha!Dickon \u2013 MY LORD! Randyll \u2013 MY LORD! Bronn \u2013 Mah Looord.Cersei is doing good in King\u2019s Landing. I wonder what she felt when Mycroft (Tycho in Game of Thrones) told Cersei that she is \u201cbetter\u201d than her father.Littlefinger is playing the \u201cuncle\u201d for the Stark children. And quite frankly all of this is disappointing. Littlecreep has been a really cunning character who always planned his actions. However, in the current season, he has accomplished absolute nothing so far. We will see but I don\u2019t like where this plot is going. I am also uncertain why Littlefinger gave the dagger to Bran. Furthermore, Littlefinger seems worried about the Stark kids\u2019 reunion and rightfully so.\u201cChaos is a ladder\u201d HA! Be creeped out Littlefinger, be very creeped out!I am sorry Meera. Feel free to call me whenever you need someone to speak to. But in seriousness, I still do not believe that Bran \u201cturned\u201d completely. I still feel as if he is a Stark and cares for people who are close to him.Arya\u2019s homecoming was weird. Sansa thinks Arya was joking about killing people. That\u2019s cute! After Bran mentions Arya\u2019s killing list, however, Sansa begins to worry. The character-development of both Sansa and Arya is beautiful. Both of them became what they had intended at the first place: Arya, a killer, and Sansa, a castle lady.Okay, back to Dragonstone: Missandei and Grey Worm did\u2026 many things together. Yeah, yeah, get to the point already.I firstly want to express the utter hypocrisy and the contradictions in the character of Daenerys. First of all, the scene where Jon and Dany are in a cave, Dany begins to dramatize things. You know, \u201clong before there were Targaryens, Starks, Lannisters\u201d and you think the show is trying to build something there. Then Dany proceeds to feed her ambitions and childishness \u201cI will fight for the North\u2026 when you bend the knee!\u201d Honestly, this girl really needs some reality check. Also, why is this arrogant scene under a really dramatic music? As if Dany is a really kind person who tries to help people but her hands are tied. Poor woman. Isn\u2019t people\u2019s survival more important than YOUR (not Jon\u2019s) pride, Dany, regarding the bending of the knee?!Let\u2019s rant on Dany some more: she loses the war. So what she does? She begins to blame Tyrion for it. Another huge difference between Daenerys and Jon (or even Cersei) is that the latter takes responsibility for his own actions. Not blames others for his own crap.The romance between Jon and Dany is, disappointingly, there. The cave eye-eating, Dany asking Jon\u2019s opinion, Davos alluding that Jon stared at Dany. Yup, we all know where this is going.\u201cShe has a good heart.\u201d Dude. It took you and Tyrion collectively to convince the \u201cgood-hearted\u201d person to not attack King\u2019s Landing and kill thousands of innocents. She doesn\u2019t have a good heart. She has good advisers. (And don\u2019t start with \u201cTyrion\u2019s plans failed!\u201d)Okay, enough Dany. The part where Arya fights with Brienne is beautiful. Sansa feels unease as she begins to realize that all the killing is real for Arya. I think this plotline is going to develop in the next few episodes and there might be some tension between the two. However, I do not think they will completely turn against each other.It is interesting that the Stark kids we liked at the beginning (Arya and Bran) have become relatively cold-hearted and blunt. In contrast, Sansa who did some stupid things in the first seasons is now a resolute and spirited character.C\u2019mon, not even a single punch to Theon?!DICK-on Tarly. Your name is dick-on. Interesting: why does Bronn laugh at the poor guy? Also, it is ironic that Jaime doesn\u2019t remember the lad\u2019s name yet he saves Jaime once (and possibly twice).NO SCOUTS? AGAIN?!The battle scene was shot amazingly. No wonder where the money went. The dragon was also cool but the battle seemed kind of unfair. Was like watching a massacre.I really wish Jaime had two good hands. I would want to see him kick some Dothraki and not be saved by\u2026 well, dick-on.Tyrion finally feels the burden of betrayal. While to Daenerys, the Dothraki and the Westerosi are the same, Tyrion was born in Westeros and helping foreigners kill his former people is overwhelming for him. Seeing the havoc there, I wonder what Tyrion\u2019s next moves will be.Bronn arming and shooting the catapult for 5 minutes without getting disturbed is ridiculous. Like the Dothraki soldiers are not seeing what he is doing?! Or they see it but, for the sake of the fans\u2019 interest, they let Bronn shoot. Nice.The moment when Drogon was shot was extremely satisfying.Dany gets down with Drogon, Jaime is standing there, so what does Dany do? Gets down and tries to pull the spear out without checking her surroundings. Smart.\u201cFlee you idiot. You fucking idiot.\u201d Yup, Tyrion still cares for Jaime.SUMMARY:The Winterfell arc has been relatively boring. Tensions seem to break roots between Sansa and Arya. Keep an eye for it. Moreover, Littlefinger is in grave danger because of Bran and it seems like he is unaware of it.Dany and Jon have are being engaged in romance. This arc has overall been very disappointing and forced, so far. However, I believe it will continue to develop over the next few episodes.Tyrion\u2019s not going to stay idle. He obviously felt wounded and I do not think he will continue to actively fight against Jaime. I smell emotional reconnection of Jaime and Tyrion.Overall, the episode was not written greatly but it was shot pretty well.", "\u201cBad things are coming.\u201d Davos Seaworth, from the preview of \u201cEastwatch\u201d.\u201cBend the knee and join me, or refuse and die.\u201d Daenerys Targaryen, from the preview of \u201cEastwatch\u201d.I watched \u201cThe Spoils of War\u201d last night, but I wanted to watch it again before I added my review. It is a very good episode, the best of season 7 so far. It is emotionally very triggering. I liken the intensity to \u201cThe Rains of Castermere\u201d from Season 3, and \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d in Season 5 for us sensitive viewers.I\u2019m dividing the review into 3 parts: Dragonstone, The Kingsroad and Brandon Stark. This is probably the longest answer I\u2019ve ever put on Quora, so please feel free to skim.Dragonstone: This is the setting for the return of Theon and the decision to fight Cersei. Jon has convinced Daenerys that the White Walkers are real. We see the spiral shapes on the wall along with drawings of the White Walkers.However, Daenerys cannot understand that her terms are unacceptable to Jon. He cannot bend the knee and lead his people. The trial and tribulation of Mance Ryder returns to haunt him. Jon offers an alliance and friendship. Dany needs this desperately, and already begins to rely on Jon when she finds out that Casterly Rock was a hoax, her best soldiers are trapped and as she tells Jon, she is losing the war. What does Jon say? He warns her not to melt cities and castles as she will be more of the same. Let her show the people what her followers already believe\u2014she can achieve the impossible. Did she do what he suggested when she attacked the Lannister army? That is the question.And of course, we get the earlier nudge, nudge from Davos about \u201chey, you like her, right\u201d along with the ghost of Grammar Nazi Stannis Baratheon telling Jon to use the word \u201cfewer\u201d instead of \u201cless.\u201d The setting for the romance is in full gear.Kingsroad: After defeating Highgarden, Jaime and Randyll leave the Roseroad from Highgarden, which leads directly into the castle area, onto the Kingsroad, which takes everyone back to Kings Landing. However, not everyone is going to get there.This is perhaps the most problematic part of the review as we all watched the episode, but interpreted the aptly named Field of Fire 2.O differently. I will give my understanding of this event with some recap, fully knowing that many will not share my views.Theon is shocked to find Daenerys gone from Dragonstone. Where did she go? She decided that she was done with Tyrion\u2019s advice. She questioned his feelings as his decision to move the Unsullied to Casterly Rock, benefitted the Lannisters, not Daenerys Targaryen. Tyrion is going to feel the weight of her displeasure in which he is close enough to see the battle, but unable to influence it.I was reminded of Hurin from The Silmarillion, who is captured by Morgoth, the most powerful of the Ainui. Morgoth curses him by making him watch his loved ones with Morgoth\u2019s senses, not his own. He watches massive destruction from Morgoth\u2019s lair and can do nothing to stop the evil from transpiring. I think this analogy also will tell any reader what I thought of the ambush done by Daenerys, Drogon and her Dothraki.Daenerys speaks \u201cDracarys\u201d and Drogon obeys. Men are burnt alive, and if they are lucky, they become ash in minutes. If they are not, they are roasted alive as Ned\u2019s father, Rickard Stark was roasted in King\u2019s Landing after receiving an invitation from the father of Daenerys, the mad king. Brandon Stark was forced to watch and if he tried to intervene, he was strangled. Tyrion must watch the Lannister army get destroyed as his heart is metaphorically strangled.Unlike Brandon Stark who was tricked, Tyrion understands that this is punishment for his poor advice. He sees the queen he adores become what he tried to avoid: she is a murderer now like Cersei who used fire to defeat her enemies and got a throne out of it. Will Dany get a throne for decimating the Lannister army? Something tells me no; the people have seen this before. They also have a problem with Dothraki who come from another land to kill a Lannister army. Even someone who hates the Lannisters is not going to be fond of what looks like a foreign queen using foreign soldiers who fight under different rules of engagement. Dany probably helped Cersei more than she helped herself.Some reviews have mentioned Hardhome, and I agree. Let\u2019s set up the parallel without forcing the facts:The Army of the Dead attack when the Wildlings are trying to escape and go to lands that Jon has promised them via boats that will get them to the Wall, where they can find food, then settle on land and grow their own crops.The Lannister/Tarly army just fought in Highgarden under orders from their superior officers, completing the last part of the mission which is to take the gold and the grains into King\u2019s Landing by the Kingsroad to avoid starvation in winter. Daenerys attacks the rear guard.Some of the Wildlings have fought the Army of the Dead. All believe in their existence. The Wildlings know how to fight. However, they cannot win against the dead; they can only escape.The Lannister/Tarly army seem to accept that dragons exist and they do fear the Dothraki. They are armed, but tired, and not expecting to fight, even though Randyll warns Jaime of a possible ambush. In both cases, no one expected the battle they fought. The casulties are staggering at Hardhome and on the Kingsroad.Jon Snow manages to escape with Doloros Edd and Tormund. He faces down the Night King, never expecting to see him. He cannot do anything, just look as the Night King stares back, then waves his hand. The dead Wildlings and Night\u2019s Watch members who were known to the people in the boats are now reanimated into wights and under the command of the Night King, serving them in their death. Jon managed to kill a White Walker with Longclaw, giving rise to the belief that they can be defeated through the fire based metal. But we don\u2019t know for certain as it hasn\u2019t happened since Hardhome.Daenerys Targaryen has wiped out all supplies that she too, could have used as she counted on Highgarden to supply Dragonstone with food. While the Dothraki charge the Lannister/Tarly line, she flies up the Kingsroad and orders Drogon to fire. He destroys everything on the Kingsroad: wagon, horse, armored man. She destroys the supplies she needs to spite Cersei as she is in battle mode and angry. Jaime Lannister is hurting for his dead soldiers, while Bronn manages to injure Drogon with a Scorpion Bolt. Jaime looks at Daenerys, not as Jon looked at the Night King as he sees she is mortal. He only knows that he wants her dead. Unlike Jon who cannot move against the Night King, he tries to kill her, facing a wounded Drogon who would have killed him if ______hadn\u2019t pulled him away in time.What do I see? Unfair terms of engagement. The Wildlings and Night\u2019s Watch could not survive against the Army of the Dead or White Walkers, so they escape. The Lannister/Tarly army had the Army of the Dead in the Dothraki, killing them in droves. If they get away from them, they see the magical being, Drogon, ridden by the woman who claims to be their rightful queen. She has just destroyed all their food, and most of their companions.I don\u2019t know what the show intends, but I think the comparison works. Magic is more powerful than humans. However, Daenerys is human, and she used a magical being to punish people who were doing their job\u2014obeying orders. That is what soldiers do. I cannot fathom why anyone would see her behavior as rational. She destroys men and food to prove herself superior. This worked for the Dothraki who didn\u2019t mind a burnt tent filled with Khals once they saw Dany on Dragon. However, Daenerys is not in Essos. She is in Westeros that hasn\u2019t seen a dragon in hundreds of years.King Henry says in the Shakespeare history, Henry V : \u201c I was not angry since I came to France until this instant.\u201d (Act 4, Scene 7) He is upset because the French went behind the lines and killed the boys guarding the luggage. The boys were unable to fight back, so it was an easy kill. Daenerys really did the same thing on the Kingsroad. She destroyed the humans guarding the food train along with the horses. Wouldn\u2019t a few have sufficed? Furthermore, Drogon wipes out everything on each part of the road.It is one thing to ambush men using similar weapons. It is another thing to drop a nuclear bomb on them. Drogon is the hydrogen bomb that no one expected. There are lots of ashes now. I think the show is going to punish her by killing off one or maybe even two of her dragons. Maybe the scorpion bolt will get lucky. I expected this ambush, but didn\u2019t know how wrong it would feel to me. The people of Westeros are screwed as long as their only choice on election day is Cersei Lannister or Daenerys Targaryen. I hope Jon doesn\u2019t bend the knee.Brandon Stark: One could also call this Winterfell, but I see Bran as the catalyst for almost everything that happened, save Sansa\u2019s displeasure at watching Arya outfight Brienne as she auditioned to convince Brienne to train her in arms. Bran is approached by Littlefinger, who is full of flattery and concern, stating his determination to be a caring uncle to the Stark children. It is laughable when one considers that Bran has escaped the White Walkers, lived in the wild, survived Theon\u2019s takeover of Winterfell and now is the Three Eyed Raven. Littlefinger sees an impressionable crippled boy. Bran knows this and he is willing to let that mistake continue until the word chaos appears, in which he tells Littlefinger: \u201cChaos is a ladder\u201d, eyes full of knowing. Littlefinger is properly disturbed as he knows he underestimated Bran, who refuses the title, Lord Stark. However, Littlefinger cannot even begin to fathom how off the mark he is, because Littlefinger thinks the White Walkers are nonsense, nor does he accept warging or greenseering visions. He is defiantly unmagical, a big mistake both in the North and among Starks. The show has downplayed the Stark\u2019s warging and prophetic dreaming, but keep their keen sensitivity to human behavior. While Sansa guesses at the motives for Littlefinger\u2019s gift to Bran, he has another solution.Bran sees Arya approaching Winterfell. That tells us a lot, which the show largely confirms. He knows Arya is a gifted assassin. He is aware of her list of names, which Ayra shares once Bran mentions it in the godswood, playing along with Sansa\u2019s earlier notion that Arya is not particularly talented. He probably knows that Arya killed all the male Freys responsible for the Red Wedding. He knows the gift from Littlefinger is a sign of his own guilt in the attempt on Bran\u2019s life. Bran refuses the gift in the presence of his sisters, passing it on to Arya, as he claims it is useless in the hands of a cripple. Bran is not the warrior of the full blooded Starks, That belongs to Arya. Bran has given his sister a mission: take the dagger and watch Littlefinger. I think we know how this will end.Sansa is not magical in the show, and it is easy to dismiss her as ungifted as she cannot fight like Arya, she cannot create battle strategies like Robb, she is not the three eyed raven nor the King in the North. However, Sansa endures. She survives and refuses to be a victim. Right now, she feels outclassed by her more mysterious siblings, and Jon is not around. Littlefinger will capitalize on this. Brienne may not see the threat to her mistress at first. Sansa is smart and a leader in her own right. Arya is correct when she tells her that the title, Lady Stark, suits her. That is Sansa\u2019s gift: taking care of Winterfell as the Lady of Winterfell. Sansa trained to be a lady in Season 1, learning that all of that was bunk, until one day it wasn\u2019t. She is not a preening female waiting for her prince. She is ready to assume full leadership of Winterfell while Jon takes on the greater tasks for Westeros. The Starks have come into their own. Littlefinger will be dead by the end of the season. You can take that to the Iron Bank.", "*WARNING**MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**GO NO FURTHER PAST THIS POINT*Here\u2019s my recap/review of this leaked episode of Game of Thrones:The ReachBronn\u2019s back with his delightful jokes; always a win for me!Side note: Dickon Tarly\u2019s armor looks WAY too big on him.Anyways, Randyll Tarly is discussing strategy with Jaime Lannister, which shows how good commanders they are.Meanwhile, Bronn is teasing Dickon for obvious reasons. I just feel sorry for Dickon, though. That is about the worst name you can get, anywhere.The following scenes are in my opinion considered the best battle sequence in Season 7:First sign of trouble: Bronn hears a sound that sounds like a tremor, and Jaime hears it too. They realize it\u2019s the Dothraki and Jaime and Randyll start ironing up the Lannister defence.The screams, combined with the shadows, provide an epic visual and auditory ensemble before the Dothraki are even shown.Ramin Djawadi delivers again with the soundtrack as Drogon (at least I think it\u2019s Drogon; can\u2019t really see with Standard Definition) appears with Dany. Intimidating as fuck!Dany then displays her inner Aerys and burns the heck out of all the Lannister soldiers. Really makes you question if Dany\u2019s really good or not.Side note: CURSE YOU DRY GRASS!Dothraki coming out of the fire is enough to make any grown man sweat if placed in battle and it gives me goosebumps just looking at it.The Lannisters still put a good fight, and kills a good 50 Dothraki. Too bad there are, what, 100,000 more of them.At this point it\u2019s safe to say: gg Lannisters.Dothraki standing on horses while shooting arrows is badass.Back on Dany, who is looking absolutely ruthless and feels no remorse for what she has done. Her father would be so proud. She is just burning people left and right.Also, nice visual shot of Drogon burning stuff.Did Jaime really think normal arrows would bring down a dragon? Nope. And now Drogon\u2019s really pissed off and burns more stuff.Side note: Aerys Targaryen is fapping to this in the afterlife as we speak.We see Jaime still being a good warrior even with a prosthetic sword hand. Armor does work, strangely enough.Also, another nice visual shot of Bronn sparring with a Dothraki. RIP the Dothraki\u2019s horse though.Bronn then finally goes to Qyburn\u2019s Giant Dragonkilling Crossbow and prepares to aim as Dany\u2019s still on Drogon burning stuff.Tyrion randomly arrives on the scene and sees devastation. Is he losing faith in Dany now?Jaime looks around and sees scenes that will give any man who sees that on the battlefield PTSD. Seriously, it\u2019s absolutely brutal.More visual cues starring Drogon! We also get to see a nice Drogon POV towards the smoke he just created. Of course, he burns the Lannister soldiers that are unlucky to stand there (or lucky that they are still alive)Cue to Bronn at the Crossbow who shoots and misses. Dammit Bronn, you\u2019re literally the last hope of the Lannisters.Side note: Could Qyburn at least make a weapon that takes a shorter time to reload? Yeesh.Bronn fires again and it hits on Drogon\u2019s right wing, and the dragon falls, to a stunned Tyrion and a pretty relieved Bronn.And for the first time in this battle Dany\u2019s struggling. Oh, how I like these battles!Drogon manages to control himself though before he becomes a dragon-sized crater, and Bronn goes for cover as Drogon burns Qyburn\u2019s Giant Dragonkilling Crossbow.Side note: DRAGON-KILLING 101- While killing a dragon by Giant Dragonkilling Crossbow, make sure to aim for the eye. That way the dragon can\u2019t see.Jaime, in a last futile attempt, charges at Drogon as he lands on the ground, with his lance, as Tyrion watches in horror. What the heck is he thinking? Does make for good visuals though.I\u2019ll say it again: Ramin Djawadi is amazing for the soundtrack!Jaime gets Bronn-ex-machinaed at the last second when he\u2019s about to get burned, and with that all hope of Lannister victory is lost. He dives into a lake, and the episode ends.King\u2019s LandingThe Iron Bank in the form of Tycho Nestoris is holding court with Cersei, and boy, does the bank look serious. Do not fuck with this bank.However, fortunately for her, the Iron Bank will support Cersei\u2026for now.Cersei must be thanking the heavens that they took Highgarden.WinterfellWe now cut to Littlefinger who gives his dagger to the Three-Eyed Raven, formerly known as Bran Stark. It\u2019s like they are two separate entities now, which is weird.Littlefinger rambles on about \u2018chaos in the world\u2019 and then the Three-Eyed Raven successfully freaks him out by alluding to his \u2018chaos is a ladder\u2019 speech back in Season 3.Meera then rejects the Three-Eyed Raven because he is no longer Bran.But HEY! ARYA\u2019S BACK! Of course, she has to get past some spiffy guards, but she\u2019s already done that before (back in Season 1)*STARK REUNION ALERT* Sansa and Arya reunite, and Arya at least shows some emotion. I kinda like this one since before their family was torn apart, Sansa and Arya\u2019s relationship was really frosty. Shows how much things change.*DOUBLE STARK REUNION ALERT* Arya then meets the Three-Eyed Raven (also known as Bran Stark) and once again the Three-Eyed Raven demonstrates that he isn\u2019t a hugging person.The Three-Eyed Raven then freaks Arya out, which is really saying something.The dagger that the Three-Eyed Raven has is then passed to Arya since the Three-Eyed Raven doesn\u2019t really want it (and let\u2019s face it; why would he want to keep it?)Brienne is now training Pod (side note: I feel sorry for Pod) when Arya walks in and asks Brienne to train her.Side note: Seriously? Arya needs training?Brienne anyway trains her but is really impressed by Arya, who coolly says that \u2018no one\u2019 trained her (I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE ARYA)Sansa and Littlefinger look over Arya\u2019s training, and do I spy worry looks on Littlefinger\u2019s face? It seems so.DragonstoneDany meets Jon again after engaging in girl talk with Missandei, and Jon shows her the dragonglass mines. He then talks about the Night King and gives Dany a lesson on what White Walkers are and why he needs her dragons.Side note: Is it just me or am I getting romantic expressions over them?Coming out they find Tyrion and Varys who tells them they gained Casterly Rock but lost Highgarden. Gotta hate those Pyrrhic victories, eh?Dany then goes full-rant mode and doesn\u2019t listen to Tyrion\u2019s counsel, which I understand since Tyrion kinda was at fault for Dany losing (almost) all her Westerosi support. Is this the beginning of their relationship breaking up?Jon tries to dissuade her but fails, and it shows the two contrasting points of view for Jon and Dany.Jon and Davos Seaworth then get into a conversation about how much men they have in the North.Side note: Davos finally learned from Stannis and knows when to use \u2018less\u2019 and when to use \u2018fewer\u2019. Since Jon knows nothing though, Davos of course has to teach him. Shireen would be proud!The duo then meets Missandei who Jon explains what bastardy is, and Davos takes curiosity as to how Missandei got to Dragonstone. Quite pointless in my opinion but I\u2019ll take it.The trio then meets Theon and Jon\u2019s welcome with him is a bit cold, to say the least. Remember, Jon still thinks Theon killed Bran. Anyways, Theon wants to see Dany but Jon says that she\u2019s gone.Overall, HOLY CRAP. This is BY FAR the best Season 7 episode, and I\u2019d be willing to rank it inside my Top 10 Favourite Episodes of all time. We have two Stark reunions, a very impressive battle sequence, all coupled with the soundtrack magic of Ramin Djawadi. A must-see!", "It\u2019s fun how everything is playing out like a fan fiction now instead of the \u201cerrybody gets raped and dies covered in shit\u201d GRRM style of the earlier seasons. They\u2019ve graduated from \u201cgritty Vietnam war analogue\u201d to \u201cfantasy adventure heroes\u201dArya is an untouchable ninja Batman anime heroine that can defeat highly skilled, hulking, armored knights with her little dagger jutsu.Daenarys is a dragon riding princess revolutionary with an ethnically diverse army of loyal good hearted people\u2026 the rapey tendencies of the Dothraki have been ignored for now.Bronn is a goddamn super soldier of unlimited stamina and sure swordarm that will always be there for m\u2019lord and can crank a siege weapon normally operated by a crew of burly men all by himself, firing it off with the speed and accuracy of a video game turret.Three-Eyed Raven has awoken to his Kwizatz Haderach powers, as the Bene Gesserits foretold.Jon is the hero prince of royal blooded prophecy come to unite the world against the cosmic evil force and is innocently incorruptable by dirty old man politics.Cersei is the dark lord with undead monsters that would\u2019ve had her way if it wasn\u2019t for the teenagers with attitude standing against her.That friendly fat guy has successfully lasted multiple seasons being a nice helpful person without getting raped and murdered by a wrinkly man, good for him as he does his science stuff and treats women with respect.For extra fun go back to the Season 1 Game of Thrones reviews praising the series for its gritty, everyone-can-die, not-your-typical-fantasy-heroism storytelling.We\u2019ll see what kind of horrible fate awaits them in GRRM\u2019s next book.", "It's easily the best episode in the season yet, and it's all because of that glorious battle we witness at the end of the episode. Said sequence being perhaps the most epic battle in the series so far.We start the episode with Jaime and the Lannister-Tarly army on their way back to King\u2019s Landing, trying to hurry along with their spoils of war.Cut to Cersei and Tycho Nestoris, with the banker all but falling over himself to offer the Iron Bank\u2019s services to Cersei. The Golden Company finds mention, and I'm certain we'll see them entering the scene in the next couple of episodes now that the Lannister-Tarly army is facing a severe burnout issue.The Starks are finally together in Winterfell. Arya gets herself in the castle with characteristic pluck and aplomb. Her reunion with Sansa is measured in sentimentality, as expected. Both of them realise that they've changed much since they last saw each other, but they're unsure about how much and in what ways.Sansa comes to realise it to some degree when Bran talks to Arya about her kill list and when Arya spars with Brienne. That scene was a real joy to watch. Brienne underestimates the tiny, fluid Arya when they begin. But Arya has learnt much from her dancing master and from the Faceless Men. Both of them end the match as equals, while Littlefinger watches on with his inscrutable face on, processing everything. But it seems Sansa got a bit too distressed to see her little sister changed to this degree.Speaking of change - it's a word that seems to be missing from the lexicon of Madame Targaryen. Getting Jon Snow on his knees (maybe in more than one sense) is all that's on her mind, despite Jon's elaborate exposition of the cave paintings depicting an alliance of the First Men and the Children of the Forest against the White Walkers. The show is definitely trying to build another incestuous angle here with Jon and Dany (since Dany is Jon's aunt if R+L=J). Jon also comes face to face with Theon after an eon with an expected dynamic.And now, coming to the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. Dothraki screamers and a Drogon-mounted, dracarys-mouthing Daenerys vs Jaime, Bronn, Dickon Tarly and the Lannister-Tarly army. Lord Tarly was conspicuous by his absence, even if we allow that he was likely at the front of the convoy than the rear. No prizes for guessing the outcome of the battle, but the entire sequence has been shot amazingly well.The sheer terror of the soldiers facing the Dothraki and Drogon the dragon; the horror of dead and alive charred bodies; the hopeless-yet-dogged resistance by Jaime as he tries in vain to hold off the screamers and the dragon - all of these were captured to brilliant effect.Bronn deserves a special mention here. We start the episode with him complaining about not being compensated adequately. We see him at the end of the episode as a man comprised almost entirely of guts and heart. Facing off a dragon in the face not once, but twice. And wounding him enough to ground him in the bargain. It remains to be seen if he survived the blast of napalm after bravely throwing Jaime out of the way, but I'm not too worried about it since he's one of the most popular characters on the show.All things considered, this is easily the best episode of the season. Can't wait for it to release on Monday so I can watch it again in glorious HD.", "MASSIVE PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD\u2026To be frank, I debated whether I should answer this question at all today, or wait for Monday morning (here in India) after the episode\u2019s official broadcast.In the end, because Quora is fundamentally a different forum than Reddit or YouTube, I decided to answer this question here. But, I do not offer any apology to anyone who feels that this question should not have been answered at all.AGAIN, MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 4, AHEAD. DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU CHOOSE TO READ AFTER THE END OF THIS SENTENCE.So, with the disclaimers put in place, here\u2019s my list.The episode opens exactly where I hoped it would, on the traveling Lannister army that is transporting the Tyrell gold to the capital. Bronn\u2019s impetuosity is ridiculous and charming, since he, an upjumed sellsword, just tried to claim one of the most ancient castles in Westeros. Jaime shoots this down and throws in some shade, for good measure. This is a reference to the books, where Bronn has made himself Lord of Stokeworth.Tycho and Cersei\u2019s conversation would have been riveting in an earlier season, now it\u2019s just filler material. This conversation finally references the Golden Company, who I\u2019m convinced will appear in season 8. Another wonderful nugget of information was that Qyburn is Cersei\u2019s Hand (really?). Last week, it was Daenerys foreshadowing the Mad King by forbidding weapons in her presence (she continues to do this), and this week it\u2019s Cersei, appointing a disagraced maester/necromancer as her Hand, as Aerys\u2019s last Hand was the pyromancer Rossart.LF\u2019s conversation with Bran is hilarious because it reveals to us that LF can\u2019t even imagine something bigger than himself, like the Others or the dragons or Bran. And Bran is at that level now, no longer human, as is illustrated in his conversation with Meera. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see Meera again this season, though she probably will return will her people for the big fight, possibly along with her father Lord Howland, who knows about R+L=J.Arya\u2019s arrival at Winterfell is completely in character, and yet who other than Sansa could lay claim to the title of Lady Stark when Arya asks which Lady Stark is currently in charge of Winterfell. I think this was a goof-up by the writers. That Arya and Sansa would meet in the crypts rather than in the courtyard was well done, and the show is trying hard not to show Lyanna\u2019s tomb in this scene, which should be right next to Eddard\u2019s.I noticed that Bran returned Arya\u2019s hug and then gave Sansa a very meaningful look, which Sansa reciprocates. I think Sansa is trying to anchor Bran to his humanity and that effect gets stronger as more of the original six Stark children arrive. Bran recognizes that, and he tells Arya that he sees her all the time now, which means that she plays a big part in the war, since that is Bran\u2019s primary concern. The dagger is then revealed, and gifted to Arya, and the three siblings are united in their distrust of LF. This is a framing device for the later manipulations of LF in trying to play Sansa against her siblings.That one scene of Arya wheeling Bran into the yard of Winterfell with Sansa following close behind, that nearly moved me to tears. On this show, you get so few moments where genuinely good things happen without anyone dying and this was a big one. To ruin it, we then see LF staring at the reunited siblings and just then, a raven starts cawing near him. This is a hint, that Bran is watching him while he\u2019s watching them.Jon takes Daenerys on an interactive history trip and I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s so impressed with the obsidian. She knew it was there and didn\u2019t give a hoot about it. The next bit though, it\u2019s pure theory gold, a veritable motherlode for book theorists. The Children of the Forest and the First Men fought a battle against the Others at Dragonstone, or so it appears, but doesn\u2019t that imply that wights can swim? They can, in the books, but on the show. Jon\u2019s defense of the Wall is based on the assumption that wights can\u2019t swim.Daenerys is given a shocking realization of how forces bigger than her at play, and dumbs it down to bend the knee and I\u2019ll fight for you. That argument gives her no leverage over Jon, because the Others won\u2019t stop after conquering the North. No, if none of the southron nobility help Jon, then he, the northerners and the Vale men fight and die, and their corpses will help the Others destroy the South.It\u2019s utterly baffling to me that while Tyrion deservedly gets dressed down for his failures, Varys doesn\u2019t catch any heat at all. Varys has failed in providing even basic information. By the way, I love how Tyrion\u2019s we have a plan, it\u2019s still a good plan sounds like a desperate salesman, and his pitch doesn\u2019t work with Daenerys, who has decided to deus ex machina the war by burning the Red Keep itself. This is the show reminding us that Daenerys can go destroy Cersei whenever she wants to, and they are right.For all of his cleverness and talent with strategy, Tyrion hasn\u2019t commanded through a war. Jon has been fighting and leading ever since he left Winterfell. So, it\u2019s lovely to see Daenerys recognizing the things he\u2019s achieved and ask him for advice. Jon\u2019s words to Daenerys sound a lot like what Tyrion says all the time, but he puts in two specific references, namely melting castles as Aegon I did to Harren Hoare at Harrenhal, and burning cities, as Aemond did to the entire riverlands during the Dance of the Dragons. I think Tyrion and Jon convince Daenerys to attack the Lannister army a few miles outside of King\u2019s Landing. This is a reference to the books, where Jon counsels Stannis, who wants to assault the heavily-fortified Dreadfort, to instead gather the allegiance of the northern nobility by retaking Deepwood Motte from the ironborn.Brienne is still beating Podrick blue (get it?) and frankly I\u2019m worried he\u2019s not learning anything, given how close the big war has come. Then Arya arrives, and we see the best sparring session since the one that led to the bastards are not allowed to hit princes joke. Sansa\u2019s expression here looks a lot like jealousy and for all she\u2019s endured and all she\u2019s achieved, she probably feels like the underachiever, since one of her siblings is a resurrected King of Winter, one has mysterious fighting skills and the other one is a demigod. LF will prey on these feelings in the coming two episodes.Jon\u2019s talk with Davos about Daenerys\u2019s good heart had better be a red herring and I like how Missandei calmly outlines why she follows Daenerys. I completely approve of Jon\u2019s enduring cynicism of Daenerys and it shows that he\u2019s not letting his little head do his thinking for him. The confrontation with Theon was a bit of a let-down, but it had to be cut short, and for good reason.Now this part, to be honest, I thought this would happen in the next episode. I did predict that this would happen at the exact location it happens. Bronn laughing at Dickon\u2019s name and the latter revealing his misgivings with betraying the Tyrells gives me hope that he will outlive his father. Bronn is somehow the first one to hear the cavalry charge, even before Jaime, who has likely participated in dozens of such battles over his very active military career.Before I get to the battle itself, here\u2019s something that continues to bother me. The Tarly are a wealthy and powerful house in their own right, so why is it that even Lannister infantrymen have ornate plate armor while the Lord of Horn Hill and his son wear plain black plate that looks like it came out of a machine shop and was strapped on to their bodies straightaway. On a show that spends hundreds of millions on CGI, it is puzzling that such a basic, non-CGI mistake keeps getting made. At least put the huntsman of Tarly on their breastplates.Now to the battle itself. This was always going to be a rout. You put a tired and burdened infantry on an open field against a well-trained force of barbarians and the former will always get slaughtered. The history of the invasion of Attila the Hun is proof of that. Daenerys has a dragon, and if this one dragon can inflict so much death, then I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the nobility of Westeros started swimming to Dragonstone to see who would be first to reach her seat and bend the knee to her.How does Bronn survive everything? The man doesn\u2019t wear any armor, and even though he jumps clear of the scorpion platform, there is no logical way he could have jumped far enough to avoid Drogon\u2019s flames. Also, if lying down on the ground on your back is the way to avoid being roasted by a dragon, why isn\u2019t it working for every other Lannister and Tarly soldier? I do enjoy Bronn as a character, I do, but this is not like defeating Vardis Egen, who was weighed down by Lysa\u2019s stupidity, this is dodging dragonfire by lying down on the ground. Also, he\u2019s able to correctly locate both Qyburn\u2019s weapon, and then later, Jaime with pinpoint accuracy through the fog of war?Speaking of Jaime, I love that \u2018why always me?\u2019 expression when he hears Drogon\u2019s screech right after he says we can hold them off to Bronn. Jaime\u2019s crucial mistake is that he doesn\u2019t account for Daenerys overruling Tyrion. Just as Tyrion errs by trying to fight Cersei without taking Jaime into consideration, Jaime\u2019s fatal mistake to fight Tyrion without taking into account that Daenerys can always choose to overrule Tyrion. Anyway, it seems that she deliberately targets the convoys of supplies heading up to King\u2019s Landing, something else I predicted. It also looks like the Dothraki have been specifically instructed to inflict as many casualties as possible, since they disregard the plunder in the wagons to kill as many soldiers as they can. Also, if Daenerys is in the fight, why aren\u2019t her bloodriders leading the Dothraki on the field? And are they protecting Tyrion as his personal guard on the field of battle, or is he de facto their prisoner (tinfoil theory) after his many failures?Jaime\u2019s regression into shit for honor person is complete, when his big courageous move to ride down an unarmed woman on the field of battle, She wields the greatest weapon of them all, though, and once again, even though Jaime is riding close to the shore, Bronn is able to find him, hit him with exactly the right amount of force at the right amount of time to throw them both safely out of the dragon\u2019s line of fire and in deep water. Realistically, they should have hit waist-deep water and come up just to receive a second blast of Drogon\u2019s fire. Since, Jaime and Bronn can\u2019t die here, what happens instead that they get thrown into deep water, where Jaime, encumbered by the weight of his armor and his hand, begins to sink. I expect he will be rescued by the non-armor-wearing Bronn.I will conclude by discussing the minimal impact Qyburn\u2019s scorpion bolt had on Drogon. All it did was startle him, since he hasn\u2019t been hurt in combat since the fighting pit of Meereen, and make him angry. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s badly, or even significantly, hurt and will recover in a jiffy once the bolt is removed. If anything, the destruction of the Lannister-Tarly army and the loss of the Iron Bank\u2019s gold along with Drogon\u2019s injury scare (not to mention Daenerys nearly getting herself decapitated by one of those bolts) will put a bit of a pause on the war.", "It is the best episode of season 7 so far. Many huge things happend in this episode. Some reasons why it is so great:Arya returned to Winterfell. She is now becoming one of the greatest fighter we have ever seen in got. So far in the season we were not able to see any of her skills. She was just travelling. Now we get to see her insane abilities.Bran just owned Baelish in this episode with just one sentence which Baelish made to Varys a few seasons back: Chaos is a ladder.We are seeing something happening between Dany and Jon. I think this is leading upto an alliance made up by marriage which we heard in mereen in season 5.The biggest reason because of which this a great episode is the battle of dothraki and drogon vs the Lannisters army. We get see what we were waiting for almost 2 years: A full fleged fire breadthing dragon rode by Danaerys targeryen converting every bone and muscle of their enemy into ashes. Drogon is clearly the greatest dragon now in game of thrones surpassing Balerion the dread.But we saw why Jaime is still one of the most important character in game of thrones. He was leading an army against a certified death. He also thought of killing Dany and thought of ending the war. I think this is also an indication for him being the prince who was promised and who will end the war when the long night comes. Bronn also was very important in this episode. He was able to hit drogon with the \u201cscorpion\u201d.Overall this episode was what we were waiting for past one year. They were able to make battle which was I think the best. And also now we are seeing many characters leading upto something very important in coming episodes.", "A bit late to the party, but I\u2019ll offer my two cents (very long answer approaching):First of all, it\u2019s worth nothing that I am heavily biased toward the Targaryens in the final battle (I like the Starks the most, but Targaryen>Lannister), so take my answer as you will. Also, I pretty much agree with other posters as to the beginning of the episode, so I will focus on the final battle:GOT S7E4 Final Battle:I just don\u2019t understand all the hate Dany is getting throughout this episode. Where do I begin? The first argument that people use against her is that she brought a bunch of Dothraki \u201csavages\u201d onto the shores of Westeros and used it to attack a Lannister army. What did you expect her to do? All her Westerosi allies were dead, the Dothraki and her dragons were all she had left, and she needed a victory somewhere to stop losing the war. Just because Dothraki are \u201cmongols\u201d and the Lannisters are \u201cwestern Europeans,\u201d just because the Dothraki have a \u201cwarlike culture\u201d does not make the Dothraki more savage; when King\u2019s Landing was sacked in Robert\u2019s Rebellion, for example, Lannister soldiers raped, murdered, and looted everywhere. Every army has its fair share of rapers. Assuming Dany is unable to control the Dothraki and they loot everywhere, they are doing what any other army would have done.Lannister supporters also like to state that Daenerys burned so many \u201cinnocent men with families\u201d during the battle. Pretty much any Westerosi army is comprised of decent men who are just following orders. When the Bolton men in the Battle of the Bastards were slaughtered by the combined Stark-Arryn-wilding force (end battle), I didn\u2019t see anyone yelling \u201cOMG y u kill innocent men dem Bolton families can\u2019t survive without de men in the winter OMG shame shame.\u201d The Stark men did what they had to do, if it meant killing people just following orders. Going back even further, Robb Stark\u2019s men slaughtered Lannisters during the War of Five Kings, Lannister soldiers killed the Tullys, and going back even further to Robert\u2019s Rebellion, the rebels killed \u201cdecent men following the Mad King\u2019s orders,\u201d and so on. Throughout GOT history, and indeed real life human history, armies have often been composed of decent men whose only crime was happening to live somewhere and therefore being forced into the army. Civilians have also been slaughtered in war. In WWII, 80 million were killed, most of them civilians and most others decent soldiers. You get it. War is hell. The only way to not kill innocent people in war is to not have war at all.I know there will be people who would say something like \u201cWell, Dany used dragonfire to slaughter innocent men, bringing the uncalled for violence to another level.\u201d Well, Dany used dragons against the ships in Slaver\u2019s Bay, and I bet most of the men on those ships were people following orders, yet nobody cared. Most of Stannis\u2019s army at the Blackwater was burned to death with wildfire (probably even more than Dany killed in the Field of Fire 2.0, since Stannis\u2019s army was much bigger). How come nobody cried for them? The answer I can think of is that Bronn and Jaime were on the Lannister side this battle, and the audience has been introduced to some good Lannister men this season. Nevertheless, this doesn\u2019t make the Lannister men any more unique than other men in other armies.Earlier this episode, Dickon even expressed regret at having killed some Tyrell troops he had known, to which Jaime answers that they didn\u2019t deserve death but Lady Olenna chose the wrong side. Same here. Lannister troops were good, but their leaders chose the wrong side.I know some will say that Dany went complete overkill by using Drogon when Dothraki would have been enough. She simply used what was remaining at her disposal. She didn\u2019t originally plan to use Dothraki and dragons, but she lost the rest of her troops. In battle, you want to ensure victory, if you truly need it. Dany was losing the war and needed an ensured victory. She used her dragons. Think of the dragons like the US Air Force: deadly, terrible if used wrongly (like if Dany burned King\u2019s Landing), but not invincible (Bronn injured Drogon). You see the US military going into wars with aircraft carriers, tanks, artillery, aircraft, exponentially more technology than its opponents. Yet you see few, if anybody, say something like \u201cThat\u2019s overkill! Cut the amount down!\u201d When Europeans colonized the Americas, Africa, and Asia (like Dany invading Westeros), they didn\u2019t hesitate to use superior weapons and technology to slaughter the opposition (of course there are exceptions).Isn\u2019t this not fair? Of course it\u2019s not fair. In war, if you find yourself in a fair fight, you\u2019ve done something very, very wrong. That\u2019s why people build castles in GOT, why they fight in advantageous terrain (Bloody Gate), why they equip their armies and train them the best possible. It\u2019s so they can have an advantage. Like why would you willingly fight on even odds? 50/50 chance of losing? Are you stupid? It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with 3 bullets in the barrel. You don\u2019t have to have dragons to be equal, mind. When Jaime surprised the Tyrells at Highgarden, when the Arryns surprised the Boltons at Winterfell, it was not equal. When Stannis attacked King\u2019s Landing with his huge force, it was overkill (not counting Joffrey\u2019s wildfire), yet nobody called him out for it.Finally, people criticize Dany for burning the supply wagons. How could she have known there was food in the wagons? She may have thought they contained weapons, or gold. Even if she did know there was food in there, she couldn\u2019t have attacked the Lannister soldiers without fear of friendly fire, and burning the wagons helped scare the Lannisters more and helped route them. Plus, the maybe 10 wagons she burned couldn\u2019t have had all the Reach\u2019s food.Some people don\u2019t like how the Dothraki warrior said to Tyrion that \u201cYour people can\u2019t fight.\u201d This was meant as a jest/taunt/insult, not an argument backed by evidence. If you take offence, then it\u2019s working as intended.PS: I\u2019m not a complete Dany supporter. I recognize she had her faults (give the Lannisters one more chance to surrender before the battle maybe, even if they had attacked Highgarden first). I also didn\u2019t want Bronn and Jaime to die. I would have done the same as Bronn (shooting Drogon) and Jaime (trying to charge Dany in the end). However, I just don\u2019t understand where the Dany hate comes from.", "SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!It was one hell of an episode . I did not want to watch the episode but as you all know Internet is dark and full of terrors I had to watch it .Some of the amazing higlights :\u2022 Littlefinger gave that valyrian steel dagger to Bran Stark and reminded him it was used in an attempt to kill him . Meera Reed left winterfell and was disappointed when Bran said \u2018thank you\u2019 at the end I think she was expecting a \u2018I love you\u2019 from him .\u2022Dragonstone :Jon and Daenerys went to the beneath in seatch of Dragon glass and on the wall there were a lot of paintings carved depicting the First men , Children of the forest and the White Walkers . Daenerys felt amazed and told Jon that she will help him if he bends the knee .Then the news of Highgarden\u2026and Dany got tensed and decided to take the matter in her own hands .\u2022Winterfell :My most awaited moment\u2026.Arya back to the Winterfelk bitches\u2026ohh yeah\u2026and another Stark reunion \u2026Sansa and Arya met in the crypts and now have a respect for each other . Arya met Bran in the weirdwood trees ..again emotionless and told he saw her at the crossings and gave her that valyrian steel dagger called Catspaw .Then Arya and Brienne got into a casual sworfight and Arya gave a tough fight to Brienne and she was damn surprised and asked who taught her and she replied \u2018No one\u2019 .Baelish and Sansa were watching her and they were surprised too\u2026seems like this season is not for Baelish xD\u2022Kings Landing :The Iron bank is having Cersei\u2019s back as long as the gold keeps coming to them .\u2022Highgarden :Randyll Tarly informed that gold is transported to KL and they were just moving away..then Dothrakis and Drogon took them with surprise and Lannister soldiers were actually shaking .Now I understand why Robert Baratheon said that only a fool would face Dothrakis in an open ground\u2026.they were too good and unstoppable with their weapons ..my favourite part was they standing on their horses , killing them with arrows and then jumping and killing them with their weapons..that was the best battle I\u2019ve ever seen . First time I saw Bronn to be so tensed xD . Drogon set the field on fire . Bronn then used Qyburns\u2019s machine and throw a arrow near Drogon\u2019s neck and he nearly fall\u2026Tyrion was also there and was terrified as hell but Drogon managed to control himself and Daenerys tried to pick that arrow and Jaime who saw his army getting roasted took a spear and was determined to throw that in Drogon\u2019s eyes , Tyrion saying \u2018fuck , don\u2019t do it\u2019 but at the last moment Drogon saw it and tried to burn Jaime but at the last second a man pushed Jaime into the water and we saw him drowned into the deep water and the epiosode was finished .One thing I notice is that Tyrion still care for Jaime .", "Ok, time for my weekly roundup of thoughts and grievances.In no particular order:#1: The Short GoodbyeI thought the Meera scene was really important. If nothing else, it explained why Bran went full homeschool.Going a layer deeper, Bran is also functioning in this scene as a stand-in for the gods of Westeros (and neighbouring lands). Why don\u2019t they ever act in the ways we expect they should? Possibly because their loyalties are more expansive than ours. They see a bigger picture and care for different ends than we do with all our myopic personal struggles and vendettas.It\u2019s hard to see yet if the remaining episodes are going to dive deeper into this angle or whether they\u2019ll leave it for the books, but it\u2019s an interesting thing to ponder. Each deity (even lesser ones like Bran and The Night King) seems to want something that\u2019s rational to some unseen perspective.What might those be? And how would our feelings about the various character arcs change if we saw them from a wider point of view?#2: Live By the Dagger\u2026As I touched on last week, the show has gone a bit foreshadowing crazy \u2014 but now to the point that they're really killing dramatic tension.As we learned in Episode 3, Littlefinger is considering some stunt using the archived raven scrolls of Winterfell.Bran will know what actually happened re: whatever narrative Littlefinger tries to spin, which he\u2019ll tell his sisters.Arya likes killing people that screw with people she loves.Littlefinger\u2019s sharp and shiny dagger is now in her belt.Sansa is already a wee bit tired of Littlefinger\u2019s antics.Well, I wonder how that storyline will end?!#3: The Sound of One Trick ClappingBuilding on the same theme, I think we\u2019ve reached peak callbacks. It\u2019s a cool trick in moderation, but they need to staaaahp with the overkill.A non-exhaustive list I saw on Reddit from just this episode:The line between cable and network TV is supposed to be how the showrunners treat their audiences. I\u2019d love them to aim a bit higher.The real downside here is that the more frequently echoes are used as plot devices, the narrower the list of possible plot outcomes becomes \u2014 which is a nuisance when we\u2019re already struggling with excess foreshadowing and general plot armour.For example, thanks to Olenna, we know that Jaime has to get back to Cersei to have his confrontation with her (echoing his stand against Mad King Aerys). This really takes the punch out of using his sinking body as this week\u2019s closing shot.#4: This Week in AwesomeBronn losing his gold reminded me of Jack Sparrow losing his rum in the best of ways. Also him gunning with that ballista thing (which I refuse to call by its supremely dumb show name) was pure 00\u2019s action movie awesome.Tyrion watching the Lannisters get mowed down played well with Dickon mourning the deaths of his former Tyrell mates. These are good things. Seeing the fallen as our brothers is a big part of what causes a generation to finally reject war.This updated character bio\u2026Drogon apparently never having learned how to dodge a wrench.Someone is trying to roast Jaime every episode (physically or metaphorically) and I love it.Arya\u2019s \u201cno one [taught me that]\u201d was dope. Though it made me feel like it was yet another installment in the show\u2019s tour of shedding B characters. If that was the final homage to the Faceless Men, I\u2019m going to be lowkey disappointed. I guess we\u2019ll get the real payoff from their storyline in the books.Theon showing a sign of life! Has any character ever taken us for a ride like he has? (Non-rhetorical question. I couldn\u2019t think of any, but maybe I overlooked a few?)I loved seeing Dany go Moana on us. \u201cGUYS, WE WEREN\u2019T MEANT TO STAY ON THE ISLAND. JUST LOOK AT THESE CAVE DRAWINGS.\u201d I\u2019d pay ones of dollars for someone to make a montage of her ship scene from the end of last season with How Far I\u2019ll Go in the background.#5: The Virtue of ThoughtfulnessI think how this show takes on stigmas and taboos is one of its subtle (too subtle?) strengths. It forces us to look at hard at things we generally only have shallow and/or reflexive opinions about in real life.Well, the Jonerys (Danno?) train is picking up speed as it heads towards Incest Station. That the two didn\u2019t get there already in the cave was probably an intentional tease on the part of the showrunners. I guess they\u2019re setting it up for this season\u2019s finale (which allows the grand \u201cyo, that\u2019s your aunt\u201d reveal and its aftermath to pop up in the final run).It reminded me of the episode of Community when Garrett and Stacy find out at their wedding reception that they\u2019re actually cousins, with Chang making a speech about how that doesn\u2019t make their love any less real. Given how prevalent cousin marriage still is in the world, that episode gave me pause and encouraged me to discard my \u201crednecks as backwater philistines\u201d narrative \u2014 or to at least see it more dimensionally.That the show is clearly going there is interesting. It\u2019s going to make us feel uncomfortable, but maybe that\u2019s a good thing?PS - I seem to be in the minority on it, but I really loved the scene with Greyworm and Missandei a few weeks back. Both had never had ownership over their own bodies. Both had all kinds of negative self-images. That they could meet in an expression of trust and affection was amazing. I appreciate that the show takes time to explore those little human alleys, even when they aren\u2019t core to the plot.#6: A Slow EducationAs I touched on last week, I think Danny\u2019s gradual come-around to the evils latent in her \u201cI am the rightful queen\u201d narrative is the real spine of the show. Either she\u2019ll end up as a benevolent ruler or her story will become the new reigning myth of power use by those who survive her.(Some have speculated that Sansa and Tyrion end up ruling at the end. The longer I thought about it, the more it seemed plausible. While Dany has had the longest path to enlightenment, you can kinda imagine her giving her life and the other two having twins named Jon and Danny to bring it all full circle.)Anyway, the current stage of her education revolves around that old saw about the danger of having a hammer as your sole tool (in that every problem begins resembling a nail). Well, when you only have dragons and Dothraki, you run the same essential risk.Based on the preview for next week, odds are on her using Drogon to roast her some unkneeling Tarlys (thus putting a fiery end to the worst Take Your Kid to Work Day ever). This stands to make things a bit awkward when Samwise comes back from Oldtown.When you combine her ambivalence about the dignity inherent in their loyalties (ditto Jon\u2019s to his people) with her impulsive burning of the food wagons, you get the impression that she still doesn't really get it yet. She gets that she can\u2019t burn cities with dragonfire, but has yet to see how her actions are still pushing the pendulum of reciprocal harm and violence.#7: The Golden Age of TVThat battle scene though! This is the third time the show has just crushed it. First we had the struggle for survival at Hardhome (i.e., Westeros\u2019 Dunkirk), then we had the claustrophobia of the Battle of the Bastards, and now the futile terror of the Lannisters in the face of their childhood boogiemen come to life.With all due respect to other networks, HBO is making next-level TV both in terms of visual filmmaking and storytelling sophistication. When you look at episodes like this alongside entries like Westworld and The Wire, we\u2019re seeing the medium perfected. I guess the next step must be virtual, as it\u2019s hard to see how else you can get much better with current restraints.", "One of the best episode ending in a cliffhanger and shortest of the season so far.Cersei discusses further terms of engagement with Tycho . She mentions of Golden company which is one of the finest army of sell-swords having around 10000 men. It will be interesting to see if she is able to acquire their services. She also talks about recovering something which belongs to her.At winterfell, it seems that shitstorm is coming for Littlefinger. He gives the catspaw dagger to Bran and does what Litlefinger has always done to the Starks, manipulating them. The best part was when Bran mentions his famous quote \u2018Chaos is a ladder\u2019 and changes the looks on the face of Littlefinger. It seems that Bran must have seen something about what all Littlefinger has done to the Starks and the north.Then comes the farewell between Meera and Bran and its cold. Bran has reached the stage where he knows too much about the world to actually care about his sense of self.Atlast the moment I have been waiting for, Arya returns to winterfell and reunites with her siblings. The last two reunion between Starks for me hasn't been as heartwarming as the first one between Jon and Sansa. And now we know how the dagger ends up with Arya. There is still a mystery going around about who sent the cut-throat to murder Bran but I think it's largely clear that it was Joffrey.Brienne is happy that she has able to keep her vow to Catelyn. We finally see Arya in action with a sword going against Brienne and she is really good. Sansa seems surprised at what her sister can do and I think Littlefinger senses that he can work with something here. He must be planning to somehow neutralize Arya as he is unfamiliar with her and may perceive her threatening for his plans to take iron throne alongwith Sansa.At dragonstone we see the further development of bond between Jon and Daenaerys as they discover more about their history and how the children of the forest and the first men fought the whitewalkers during the long night. Daenaeys is still hell bent on Jon bending his knees and accepting her as the queen. I am happy that the show runners have not made it all easy between Jon and Daenaerys to accept each other easily. Daenaeys has grown respect for Jon which is evident when she asks for her advice on how to proceed in the war. It's good to see that she finally realizes that she is losing and still able to keep herself stable for now.On the other side Jon also appreciates Daenaerys as he learns about how she has helped slavers in the free cities.Theon arrives and receives a customary harsh welcome from Jon. It\u2019s high time for Theon to earn back his respect and I think showrunners are moving towards that.There must be a reason why they have kept Yara alive and Theon maybe in future will go rescue Yara just like she tried to rescue him in the early season.And finally one of the best set-piece in the series where Jaimie\u2019s forces are ambushed by the Dothraki and Drogon. It reminded me of the \u201cField of Fire\u201d where Aegon during his conquest destroyed the armies of the reach and casterly rock with his dragons. Soon after that the tyrells who were the stewards pledge their loyalty to Aegon . Maybe after this , The tarlys will bend their knee to Daenaerys but the chances are low as most probably they are dead. Randall Tarly mentions that most of the gold has reached the Kings Landing, so this will make the fight more tougher for Daenaerys. Drogon spitting fire on the forces was spectacular and totally worth all the budget the show has been saving in last episode. The dothrakhi fighting and dominating the westerosi army will be headache for cersei. On the other hand , the scorpion though not able to kill drogon but still pierced his skin and made him to land. It can be improved and Daenaerys now knows that his dragons are not unkillable.One more important aspect was that Tyrion did felt sad for all the lannister men dying and seeing Jaime in danger . I believe in future he will still try to prevent any big conflict where Daenaerys has to use his dragons but still try to overthrow Cersei.All in all it was one of the best battles in the series and now we know that how much dangerous dragons are in the battle .", "Enter the Dragon!Drop your big Direwolf capes and duck for cover! Quickly! This episode is NUCLEAR!This is my recap for Game of Thrones, Season 7, Episode 4: \u201cThe Spoils of War\u201d. So far arguably the best of the season. Ready- aim- SHOOT!Scene 1As Jaime takes Highgarden's gold to pay the realm's debt to the Iron Bank, Bronn (in the first lines of the season) complains he doesn't pay \"his debt\".Bronn wants his bloody castle already, yo!Will Bronn ever care for anything but money, I wonder..?.. (Wait for it\u2026)Scene 2Tycho (AKA Mycroft from \"Sherlock\"), the delegate from the Iron Bank, is very impressed with Cersei, sell her a \"new venture\" and informs her the bank will suppprt her \"as soon as the gold arrives\".Scene 3Littlefinger gives Bran the infamous dagger an assassin attempted to kill Bran with eons ago in the first season + the one he held against Ned\u2019s throat when he betrayed him, and the one that cut his mother Catelyn's throat at the Red Wedding (ahh, good times). Quite a thoughtful gift really\u2026Baelish then goes on and on about his love for Cat, and how Bran got home only to find such chaos in the world. \"Chaos is a ladder,\" Bran reminds him, and totally freaks him out.LIKE A BOSS! He might as well have said \"BUSTED!\". You know everything, Bran Stark.Astonished and alarmed, Petyr leaves.Meera comes over to part ways, shocked at how little gratitude Bran shows for her.\"Thank you?? That's all you have to say?? My brother died for you! Hodor and Summer died for you! I almost died for you!\"(It\u2019s like she\u2019s reading fan-written opinions of Bran, who recieved anormous amount of hate after that horrifically depressing \u201cHold the Door\u201d episode).It was poignant and gutwrenching.He replies: \"I'm not Bran. Not anymore\". She tears up in realization of what he became, \"You died in that cave...\" and I'm crying right now :,(Of course the most likely case is he died mentally to evolve, but I can't help but consider maybe Bran himself is actually dead and the previous Three-Eyed Raven is in his body..?? It's a little far-fetched I know, very unlikely and I like the philosophic option a lot better but still, a possibility.Honestly this is a better character development after last week\u2019s out-of-nowhere tactless creepy behaviour.Scene 4You could cut the tension with a dagger, Arya, atop her horse, is riding with Winterfell is plain sight!!!This is actually happening, three Stark kids are getting back together- it feels too good to be true (which probably means something suicidally awful will happen very soon. Usually when stuff starts to look up ridiculously tragic catastrophes occur. So I'm waiting for the shit to hit the fan...There's a funny little bit where the guards don't believe Arya's who she is and tell her to \"fuck off\" (nice callback to Season 1 when the guards of the Red Keep wouldn\u2019t let her in) and I worried she'd go Faceless on them or something xDWhen they let her in at last and argue who'll let her in, she looks around emptionally, and then when they turn she's gone. I was all but ready to smash the TV thinking she bolted until the next scene.Scene 5Sansa and Arya reunite in the Crypts and it is EVERYTHING! As father Eddard's statue watches over them, they catch up.When Arya mentions her kill list, Sansa giggles (you have NO IDEA, sister!). They talk about how unpleasant their long stories are, but Arya says: \"our stories are not over yet\". Sansa informs her Bran's home too.Scene 6At the Godswood, Arya and Sansa go to see Bran, and wow he's got a nice brand new wheelchair (finally!).His chair resembles paintings of a chair that Bran the Builder (the one who built the Wall) sat on, which reminds me of the theory that our Bran is actually several notable Bran's throughout history, with his time-twisting abilities.(Although this theory also means he must've banged several of his great-great-great-grandmothers (yikes!) and thus is his own ancestor? I dunno lol it's freaky stuff!)Arya\u2019s puzzled when she hears of Littlefinger's presence in Winterfell, as Bran gives her his dagger.I could be wrong but I bet Arya slits Petyr's throat with that dagger (his own dagger, that is).Also she could use it on White Walkers when the time comes, since it is a Valyrian steel dagger.Scene 7Seeing three out of four Stark children home is something I never thought I'll see in a lifetime, and it makes me almost as satisfied as Brienne is right now.Petyr looks concerned as fuck though- as he bloody should be; your reign of chaos is coming to a probable violent end soon, Lord Baelish.I feel as though Littlefinger will meet his end in the next few weeks. Already he has various fronts to worry about:Arya could expose him for working with Tywin (that time in Harrenhal);Sansa could expose him murdering loony toon aunt Lysa and perpetrating the Purple Wedding (Joffrey's death);Maester Luwin's old scrolls could uncover some incriminating bombshell;The Hound (where is he anyway?) could spill the beans on betraying Poor Old Headless Dead Ned;And Bran.. Bran\u2019s tripping! JK, he probably has a variety of Littlefinger\u2019s crimes to pick which one to unravel.I recon he's finished. I genuinely believe it's no longer a matter of will he meet his end, but rather when and by whom.Unless he has one last genius trick up his sleeve... I admit it\u2019s a bit too easy, so I hope he doesn\u2019t go down without a fight!I can't help but notice a raven squeaking closeby- is Bran spying via ravens?Spy VS Spy!Scene 8There\u2019s this short chat in which Missandei doesn't need to tell Dany what happened between her and Grey Worm because it's darn obvious (wink wink).I can think of no reason why this season highlights Missandei and Grey Worm, unless she\u2019s a traitor and he\u2019s a goner.Jon and Dany go dragonglass mining together, and I hope to all things holy this isn't their \"first date\" or something, ugh.Jon shows Dany drawings the Children of the Forest drew (and ladies and gentlemen am I aching for more of these awesome creatures!) to persuade her to join his cause; the way he holds her hand has me extra worried for the romcom angle.What is it with Jon Snow and damn caves..? Is he going to \u201cbend the knee\u201d here, probably causing Ygritte to roll over in her metaphorical grave? Luckily we don't see such a thing.Dany has me fooled: \"I will fight for you. I will fight for the North\"- AWW :D - \"when you bend the knee\". Seriously..? You're starting to sound like a broken record, Blondie.\"Isn't their survival more important than your pride?\" she tells him, and the irony train blows Planetos up to ashes.Scene 9Tyrion fills Dany in with the lovely recent development in Casterly Rock and Highgarden, she is furious with him and practically blames him for it all.Dany reads my mind when she questions Tyrion\u2019s ability to fight his own family. More on that later.So Dany seeks Jon's input, which turns out to be another stellar speech:\"The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known. But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities... You're not different. You're just more of the same\".Preach, baby, preach!I've got a forshadowy feeling about this, amigos...Scene 10Arya trains with Brienne, as Pod watches then aroused, and Sansa and Littlefinger watch from above. Sansa looks disgusted / disappointed. Littlefinger looks frightened.The Dance of the Beauty & the Beast is a very heartwarming / fun scene. Brienne asks \"who taught you to do that?\" and Arya hilariously answers \"No One\", smiling.Sansa is clearly troubled by what Bran and Arya have become. Is this what Littlefinger will use to mindfuck her?Scene 11Davos teases Jon about Dany (\"I've noticed you staring at her good heart\"), which further worries me about the possible impending Jonaerys doom.In a fun callback Davos corrects Jon when he says \"less\" and he says \"fewer\", and suddenly I miss Stannis the Manis (daughterslayer!).They meet Missandei, small talk and then see something in the ocean: one lone Greyjoy ship appears in the distant.Oh no.Is Jon Snow about to murder Theon Greyjoy?!If you don't recall, they were practically brothers growing up, before Theon betrayed Robb and the Starks and infamously took over Winterfell, billions of years ago.Among other heinous crimes, he murdered two small boys and burned them alive, which he then pretended were Bran and Rickon (there's a theory they were actually his biological sons, for he had several \u201cencounters\u201d with the Miller's wife back in the good old days...)\"Sansa. Is she alright?\" asks Theon, to which Jon replies: \"What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you\".That's fair.Theon informs everyone of Yara's predicament and asks for Dany's help rescuing her, but apparently she's already gone...Did she take the dragons out for a \"walk\"? Damn...!Scene 12The Reach looks awfully similiar to a Westworld set.Anyhow Randyll Tarly (Sam's father) rides over to Jaime and Bronn to inform of the gold's safe arrival at King's Landing (looks like the banker Tycho\u2019s gonna be properly aroused next week).Jaime and Bronn ride to chat with \"Rickon\", Randyll's other son (actually Dickon, but Jaime always gets it wrong), and then brilliantly Bronn notices something wrong, and they see a large shadow... Oh my God it must be the dragon threeway!Furious chanting Dothrakis storm the scene and then, very Never-Ending-Story-like, Dany rides her dragon and says the magic word. A nice human barbeque ensues and OH MY GOD IS THIS IT FOR SER JAIME FUCKING LANNISTER?!If you don't recall, Jaime killed Mad King Aerys, Dany's father- which gave him the nickname \"kingslayer\". Is Dany finally getting her revenge on the Lannisters???Suddenly Jaime\u2019s brilliant strategy taking The Reach horribly backfires and Dany finds a way to roast people alive without looking like a merciless pyromancer (after all the victims are soldiers, not civilians).Whatever helps you sleep at night, dragonlady. You don\u2019t get any brownie points from me.This is it, my friends- the Field of Fire #2!As Tyrion watches from afar, you can really see pain in his eyes as he realizes the cruelty of the side he's fighting for- and the fact he is fighting against his own house, his own men and his own family. I swear if he and Jaime don't meet up..!I think if Tyrion wants to keep his heart of gold he should wise up about Dany's destructive potential, as should Jaime wise up about their deranged power-hungry sister Cersei.We get a nice little shot of Bronn choosing life over money (his bag of gold fell as he fell from his horse).He makes his literally bloody way to look for Qyborn's \"Scorpion\"- the secret deadly weapon against the dragons. I never would've guessed Bronn could actually be a dragonslayer.A stunning view of Dany riding Drogon almost touching a river preludes them zooming in on Jaime\u2026Now is as good a time as any for Tyrion to choose between his politic aspirations and his humanity.But no, instead Dany approaches Bronn who aims and HITS DROGON!For a long, terrifying moment it seems as though Dany will fall to her death, but then the dragon stabilizes enough to \"Dracarys\" shit up again.Unrealistically, Bronn doesn't burn to death screaming.Jaime sees Dany taking the gigantic arrow out of Drogon's scales and seizes the opportunity to attack, while Tyrion gazes at them and mutter: \"FLEE, YOU IDIOT!\".As Dany sees him approaching Drogon opens his mouth and Jaime looks as good as dead- when somebody (presumably Bronn- or Dickon?) jumps over in the save of all times- maybe sacrificially so.He fall into the water and all goes up in flames.Jaime's armor slowly pulls him deeper into the watery abyss.THE END!\u2026Episode Rating:ACTING 5EFFECTS 5PLOT 4ENJOYMENT 5ROUNDUP: 4.75\u2026WOW!!!What an outstanding episode!After last week's mild disappointment I am glad to say the season switched gears. To be honest the season has been relatively slow by now, but I think the pace is quickening.The battle was super exciting. I didn't catch the trailer shot of Jaime riding through the fire though.Interestingly, the episode aired at the annual Hiroshima bombing anniverssary. A saddle hint..?Although I terribly miss Sam, the Hound, Tormund, Yara, Melisandre, even Euron and I still hold a candle for Gendry to come back- I think it's wise they didn't give us meaningless scenes just to pop up and say hi.The only ones I REALLY wish were to make appearance are our icy undead White Walkers.Yet again we face a situation where two characters we love (Dany VS Jaime / Bronn) battle to possible death, and we don't know what to think.Personally I'm team Stark, but although Cersei is the \"big villain\", I prefer Jaime over Dany any day of the week.I'm sensing a pattern of reunions and important characters crossing paths for the first time in huge quantities every episode.I guess they wanna get that out of the way in this season and perhaps next season we'll see the Dream Team march together to fight the White Walkers.I love that this season gives a decent amount of focus on Lannisters and shows them at their best, most competent selves. Hasn\u2019t been like this ever since Tywin died really.I have to praise the performances of Nikolaj Coster-Waldo (Jaime), Jerome Flynn (Bronn), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion), Maisie Williams (Arya) and Ellie Kendrick (Meera); and the amazing effects, photography etc. used in the battle scene.Jaime and Tyrion are at their most basic humane cores. Bronn is at his most heroic and badass. Arya effortlessly owns every second and totally kills it with charisma, pathos and confidence. And Meera? She had her most saddening performance yet, and I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s gone.Is this the end of Jaime Lannister (+ Bronn, Randyll and \u201cRickon\u201d Dickon Tarly, and perhaps the mighty Drogon)? Is it also the rebirth of a new Mad Queen- Daenerys?I can hardly wait to find out next week!(For the edited article on the site TellTales: Game of Thrones \u2018The Spoils of War\u2019 \u2013 A Visual Recap)"]}, "65": {"id": "s07e05", "name": "Eastwatch", "script": "Clegane, look into the flames.

That I've come to destroy your cities,  burn down your homes,  murder you, and orphan your children.  That's Cersei Lannister, not me.  I'm not here to murder,  and all I want to destroy  is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor  to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.

You will not kneel?  I already have a queen.  Tyrion: My sister.  She wasn't your queen  until recently, though, was she?  When she murdered your rightful queen  and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.  There are no easy choices in war.  Say what you will about your sister,  she was born in Westeros.  She's lived here all her life.  You, on the other hand,  murdered your own father  and chose to support a foreign invader.  One with no ties to this land  with an army of savages at her back.  You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that.  Perhaps he could take the Black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He'd be invaluable at the Wall.  You cannot send me to the Wall.  You are not my queen.  You will have to kill me, too.  Step back and shut your mouth.  Who are you?  A stupid boy.  I am Dickon Tarly,  son of Randyll Tarly.  You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.  I will not.  Your Grace, nothing scrubs bold notions from a man's head  like a few weeks in a dark cell.  I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option, many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.  Your Grace, if you start beheading entire families--  I'm not beheading anyone.  ( roaring )  Your Grace.  Daenerys: Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly,  I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name,  Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons,  sentence you to die.  Dracarys.  ( both screaming )  - ( man shouts ) - ( Drogon roaring )  ( door closes )  My-- my lord  How many men did we lose?  We haven't done a full accounting.  It's not only armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries.  Not the same as our men, but they'll fight  if they're well paid, which they will be.  I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win.  So, what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne,  the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind, she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?  Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf  by way of apology for murdering our father and son.  He didn't.  You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.  I'm not talking about Father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.  - After all this time, it still amazes me that you-- - It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.  And this was before or after  she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?  After.  And you believed her?  If you were Olenna, would you rather have seen  your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margaery have been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna  the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.  I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.  She's dead, like her son,  her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war, we'll follow them.  So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.  ( Drogon screeching )  ( roaring )  ( snarling )  ( snarling stops )  ( exhales )  ( screeching )  They're beautiful, aren't they?  It wasn't the word I was thinking of, but  but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts.  They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get  or how terrifying to everyone else,  they're my children.  You weren't gone long.  No.  And?  And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.  You're not sure how you feel about that.  No, I'm not.  How many men did your army kill  taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?  Thousands.  We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here,  Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.  Ser Davos gets carried away.  So, it was a figure of speech?  ( footsteps approaching )      Your Grace.  Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,  an old friend.  I served with your father.  He was a great man.  You look strong.  You found a cure?  I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.  I return to your service, my queen,  if you'll have me.  It would be my honor.  ( ravens cawing )  ( ravens cawing )  ( panting )  Ravens.  We need to send ravens.  I put very little stock in it myself.  Prophecies of doom are never in short supply,  especially when winter comes.  I remember Wolkan.  A little timid, but a sharp mind.  Sandhu: Eh, the North has dulled many good maesters' wits.  Hard to say whether it's the cold, the drink,  - or the company. - ( all chuckling )  Sandhu: A crippled boy claims to have seen  dead men on the march beyond the Wall,  thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes?  Ebrose: Yes, it is a bit much.  - Still, we ought to write back-- - Sam: Brandon Stark.  - The crippled boy. - Do you know him?  I led him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the Wall.  And?  Somehow, a crippled boy  survived for years beyond the Wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch, not the wildlings, no one.  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.  Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.  I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?  ( clears throat )  Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real, they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north  to hold the Wall, they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel  to search every word of every faded scroll  about the Long Night,  they may find something that lets us defeat  the Army of the Dead for good.  It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible that this message  is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen  to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending  to open those lands to easy conquest.  Sandhu: That does seem far more likely  than magic birds talking to cripples.  Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it.  We will write to Maester Wolkan  at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.  - Archmaester, please-- - That will be all, Tarly.  Maester: It brings to mind the work of Jenny of Oldstones,  the charlatan who claimed descent from the children of the forest.  - ( all chuckling ) - Sandhu: Don't forget the prophet Lodos,  who promised that the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.  - ( all laugh ) - Ah, Lodos.  Is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive?  I'm afraid so.  Horrible business.  I haven't had the heart to tell him yet.  He's a good lad.  Right.  The ravenry was falling apart the last time I checked.  ( slurping )  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  That's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarly a choice,  a man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?  Not burn him alive alongside his son?  I am her Hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her.  That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.  It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy--  I'm not the one doing it.  When the pitch of their screams rose higher--  I'm not the one doing it.  When their hair caught fire  and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room--  I'm not the one doing it.  ( sighs )  Daenerys is not her father.  And she never will be  with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.  - Who's that for? - Jon Snow.  Did you read it?  It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.  What's it say?  Nothing good.  I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.  I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.  Bran saw the Night King and his army  marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the Wall  The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years, presumably.  I need to go home.  You said you don't have enough men.  We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away, she marches in.  Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story  made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?  I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.  So bring the dead to her.  I thought that was what we were trying to avoid.  We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.  Is that possible?  The first wight I ever saw  was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.  Bring one of these things down to King's Landing  and show her the truth.  Anything you bring back will be useless  unless Cersei grants us an audience  and is somehow convinced not to murder us  the moment we set foot in the capital.  The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He might listen to me.  And how would you get into King's Landing?  I can smuggle you in,  but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you,  I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.  Well, it will all be for nothing  if we don't have one of these dead men.  Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?  With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one.  You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.  The Free Folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.  They won't follow Ser Jorah.  They won't have to.  You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore, you're King in the North.  I'm the only one here who's fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.  I haven't given you permission to leave.  With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here  knowing that you could have your men behead me  or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger,  because I knew it was the best chance for my people,  for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger  because it's our best chance.  ( all chattering )  Glover: The King in the North should stay in the North.  We did not choose you to rule us, my lady.  - But perhaps we should have. - ( all murmuring )  The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.  Men: Aye.  You are very kind, my lords.  But Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best.  ( chatter )  Sansa: I warned Jon this would happen.  That he couldn't leave the North  and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.  He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.  Well, he's not making it easy. The Northern lords are proud.  These are Mother and Father's chambers.  And?  Nothing.  Don't do that.  - What? - Say what you mean.  You always liked nice things.  They made you feel better than everyone.  Are you angry with me?  They were insulting Jon,  and you sat there and listened.  I listened to their complaints,  which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.  Their opinions are important to you.  Glover has 500 men, Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army.  Not if they lose their heads first.  Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back,  and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods  and the wildlings and the Vale.  All of us, working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying,  but that's not the way you get people to work together.  And if Jon doesn't come back,  you'll need their support  so you can work together  to give you what you really want.  How can you even think such a horrible thing?  You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be,  but the thought just won't go away.  I have work to do.  My lady.  ( door opens, closes )  Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.  Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire.  There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.  You're not staying here?  I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.  What if someone takes the boat?  Then we're fucked. Best hurry.  We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.  All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.  Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.  And here I am, ready to train.  Why down here?  I don't think you want people to see  how you look swinging that thing yet.  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.  Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.  I'll leave you to it.  I needed to see you.  And I knew you'd never agree to meet.  You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock,  but you were three steps ahead of me.  Abandoned the family home, completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud.  - Don't talk about Father. - Listen to me--  I once told Bronn  that if I ever saw you again, I'd cut you in half.  It'll take you a while with a sparring sword.  He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did,  he hated me because of what I am.  A little monster sent to punish him.  Did he-- did he think--  did he think I wanted to be born this way?  - Did he think I chose it-- - What do you want?!  Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there's no way around that.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend the hostilities  if Cersei agrees to certain terms.  If you want Cersei to bend the knee,  you can ask her yourself.  I-- I don't. And Daenerys doesn't.  Not right now, anyway.  She has a more important request.  ( chatter )  I wasn't sure I'd find you.  Thought you might still be rowing.  ( chuckles )  I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.  Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?  Haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.  Anybody give you any trouble?  Here I am, arming Lannisters,  and I never get a second look.  But you were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.  Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.  You came to get me. You want me to come with you.  Well, the thing you need to understand is--  I'm ready.  - You-- - Let's go.  You should know what you're heading into.  What do you think I've been thinking about  with every swing of the hammer?  How happy I am making weapons  for the family that killed my father?  The family that tried to kill me?  ( scoffs )  I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for,  but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.  You might want to bring one of those swords.  I don't know much about swinging swords.  But this  this I know.  Keep your father's name to yourself.  Situation's complicated enough already.  Well, who should I say I am?  I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon,  - someone's going to-- - Gold cloak: You there!  No weapons, friends. I promise.  What can I do for you?  - Is that your boat? - It is.  - Gold cloak: The docks are that way. - Davos: That they are.  I try to stay away from them  to avoid good men such as yourselves.  - Still five gold dragons? - ( laughs ) Are you joking?  You must be even older than you look.  - 15. - 15?!  Apiece.  - ( sighs ) - ( coins jingling )  I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.  Gold cloak #2: What's in the boat?  Not more gold.  - Wine? - Mm.  - I like wine. - Or hams.  Come have a look.  - Fermented crab. - What?  Davos: Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples a brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done.  He's ready to go back to his loving family.  But before he gets his breeches up,  his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste.  I'd hurry to your favorite establishment,  or you'll put a hole in that chainmail.  ( laughing )  ( chattering )  Oi, dwarf!  I really wouldn't try any more  until you see how the first bite hits you.  That dwarf  Where'd you get that scar?  Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.  We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back.  Davos: Perhaps there's some arrangement?  ( coins jingle )  Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei--  ( grunting )  - ( sighs ) - This is Gendry.  He'll do.  Go, go, go.  Qyburn: I could give you something.  That won't be necessary.  Ser Jaime.  - ( door closes ) - Why was Qyburn here?  He's the Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?  I met with Tyrion.  What did our brother have to say?  Daenerys wants to meet.  To discuss her surrender?  To discuss an armistice.  She's just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?  Because an army of dead men  is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.  ( chuckles )  - Are you going to punish him? - Tyrion?  Bronn.  He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance  happens in this city without me knowing?  You let it happen. Why?  I've come to believe that  an accommodation with the Dragon Queen  could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers. If we want to beat her, we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like Father would have.  Dead men, dragons, and Dragon Queens  Whatever stands in our way,  we will defeat it.  For ourselves, for our house,  for this.  Who will you say is the father?  You.  People won't like that.  Do you remember what Father used to say about people?  The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.  Never betray me again.  Davos: We're leaving today.  - The king's got a lot on his mind. - I understand.  He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.  - You don't have to worry. - You're just Clovis,  a smith who's come to pay his respects  before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.  Understood.  - ( hammering ) - ( chatter )  Begging your pardon, Your Grace.  You survived King's Landing.  Yet again. Your Grace, this is Clo--  Name's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son.  He was meant to keep that to himself.  Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?  I saw your father once at Winterfell.  I met yours in my shop.  - You're a lot leaner. - And you're a lot shorter.  I grew up on stories about them.  All I ever knew is that they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you.  Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.  No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.  You know how to use one?  Well, that's a problem.  I prefer a hammer.  He can handle himself.  We could use the help.  As my father used to say,  \"It's better to be a coward for a minute,  than dead for the rest of your life.\"  I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's up there,  I can't wait out this war.  Yeah, nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.  Man: All right, come on.  ( grunts )  Tyrion: You may not believe it,  but I've missed you, Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm.  This is the coin the slaver gave me  when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?  It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.  Take it with you.  But bring it back.  Our queen needs you.  We should be better at saying farewell by now.  Your Grace, I  If I don't return, at least you won't have to deal  with the King in the North anymore.  I've grown used to him.  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.  Heave!  ( fire crackling )  Gilly: Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?  No.  15,782.  Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.  None anymore.  That's true.  This High Septon Maynard, he recorded everything.  He even recorded his own bowel movements.  What does \"annulment\" mean?  It's when a man sets aside his lawful wife.  Maynard says here that he issued an annulment for a Prince \"Ragger\"  and remarried him to someone else at the same time  in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing in the south or--?  These maesters  they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting  and annulments and bowel movements for all eternity,  while the secret to defeating the Night King's  probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere, completely ignored.  But that's all right, isn't it?  We can all become slavering, murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate  as long as we can have access to the full records  of High Septon Maynard's 15,782 shits!  Steps.  That number was the steps.  ( giggles )  Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.  I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.  - ( whispering ) - ( horse whinnies )  ( dog barking )  ( quiet chatter )  Wolkan: I found it, my lord.  It, uh, took some searching.  Maester Luwin's archives are very thorough.  You're sure this is the only copy in Winterfell?  Uh, yes, my lord.  Lady Stark thanks you for your service.  ( door closes, lock clicks )  Tormund: Isn't it your job to talk him out  of stupid fucking ideas like this?  I've been failing at that job of late.  How many queens are there now?  Two.  And you need to convince the one with the dragons  or the one who fucks her brother?  ( chuckles )  Both.  How many men did you bring?  Jon: Not enough.  The big woman?  We were hoping some of your men could help.  - Hmm. - I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there, as you well know.  You are.  You really want to go out there? Again?  You're not the only ones.  My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here.  You're the Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell.  They want to go beyond the Wall, too.  We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.  Our Lord told us that the Great War is coming--  Gendry: Don't trust him.  Don't trust any of them.  They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their lord told them to do  was sell me to a red witch to be murdered.  Jorah: Thoros?  I hardly recognized you.  Ser Jorah Mormont.  They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.  Tormund: You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?  He was my father.  He hunted us like animals.  You returned the favor, as I recall.  ( growls )  Here we all are  at the edge of the world  at the same moment,  heading in the same direction for the same reason.  Our reasons aren't your reasons.  It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.  There's a greater purpose at work.  And we serve it together,  whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps, but the Lord of Light--  For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole?  Are we coming with you or not?  Don't you want to know what we're doing?  Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell, waiting to die?  He's right.  We're all on the same side.  How can we be?  We're all breathing.  ( gate rumbling )  ( wind howling )", "summary": ["Plot Daenerys offers a choice. Arya grows suspicious. Tyrion answers a good question.   Summary In the Reach Bronn saves jaime Eastwatch Bronn pulls Jaime from the water.  In the aftermath of the Battle of the Goldroad, Ser Bronn pulls Jaime Lannister from the depths of Blackwater Rush, and onto the shore, after Jaime's failed attempt to slay Daenerys Targaryen and end the war. Bronn tells Jaime the only reason he rescued him is that nobody gets to kill Jaime until Bronn gets the reward he's due from the Lannisters. Jaime, shellshocked, remarks on the destructive power Drogon alone unleashed, and realizes they are in great peril if Daenerys deploys all three in future battles. Bronn assures that he won't be around for such an assault, as Jaime laments his duty to report what happened to Cersei. Bronn thinks it would be safer for him to jump back into the river than deal with Cersei's wrath.  Dany and Tyrion Eastwatch Tyrion and Dany pitch to the lords of the Reach.  Meanwhile on the Goldroad, Tyrion Lannister grimly assesses the carnage of the battle, seeing the ashes of wagons, horses and Lannister soldiers. The prisoners of war are being herded by the Dothraki to Daenerys, with Drogon (apparently none the worse from taking a scorpion bolt to the shoulder) perched behind her menacingly and majestically. Daenerys appeals to them, bringing up the rumors spread about her by Queen Cersei, and warnings of brutality that the Dragon Queen would bring - burning down homes, and murdering families. She assures she is not here to murder, but to destroy the wheel of power that rolls over the rich and poor alike, to no one's benefit but people like Cersei Lannister. She offers them a choice - bend the knee and join her in her quest to make the world a better place than ever before, or refuse and die. Tyrion looks at her apprehensively upon hearing this. Only a few kneel at first; Drogon, apparently insulted by their refusal to accept his mother's command, bellows at them and most quickly yield. However, Randyll Tarly, his son Dickon, and a handful of men refuse. Daenerys summons Randyll forward, where he insists he already has a Queen. Tyrion recalls he didn't pledge to Cersei until recently, and that she murdered the rightful Queen, destroying House Tyrell for good. He observes Randyll's allegiances are \"flexible\" to which Randyll answers there are no easy choices in war. He tells Tyrion that Cersei is at least a true Westerosi, and that Tyrion is a kinslayer, having killed his father, as well as supporting a foreigner, bringing savages to their continent. Daenerys accepts Randyll's answer, and prepares to carry out a sentence, but Tyrion intervenes with the possibility of sending Randyll to The Wall instead of death. Randyll replies Daenerys cannot send him to the Wall as she is not his Queen.  Dickon Randyall Tarly Eastwatch Dickon and Randyll prepare to be executed.  Daenerys signals for three Dothraki men to apprehend him, but Dickon suddenly speaks up insisting he will have to be killed too. Randyll, horrified, tries to silence his son. Tyrion reminds Dickon that he is the future of House Tarly and insists that he submit, reminding him what happened to House Tyrell. Randyll silently nods in agreement so his son may be spared. Dickon refuses to relent on his decision. Tyrion proposes to Daenerys about having them committed to the cells instead, but Daenerys, being ruthless but pragmatic, does not wish to grant the reputation of putting traitors in chains, or many would take advantage. She resumes her sentencing for them both, as they hold hands. Drogon unleashes his dragonfire, burning Randyll and Dickon alive and reducing them both to flame and ash in seconds, killing them instantly. Terrified, the remaining soldiers instantly kneel as Tyrion reflects uneasily over the execution.  At Winterfell At the Godswood in Winterfell, Bran Stark wargs into a flock of ravens to fly over the Wall into the Lands of Always Winter. Through the ravens, he sees the army of the dead led by the White Walkers and the Night King, traveling south towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. His reconnaissance continues until the Night King sees the ravens, at which Bran severs the connection. He tells Maester Wolkan that they need to send ravens at once.  Later, in Winterfell's council chamber, Arya Stark observes Regent Sansa Stark presiding over a meeting of the Northern lords. Saying that the King in the North should stay in the north, Lord Robett Glover and Lord Yohn Royce of The Vale of Arryn imply they made a mistake in their choice of ruler and that she take over power in the absence of her half-brother Jon Snow. However, Sansa insists Jon Snow is their true ruler who is doing what he believes is right for their people and that she is his regent. Following the meeting, Sansa confides her frustration in the Northern lords with Arya, who calls Sansa out for diplomatically handling their concerns instead of shutting the lords down. Arya thinks that she should not let the lords get away with insulting Jon and hints at assassinating them. Sansa disagrees, at which Arya calls attention to the fact that Sansa is using their parents' chambers and that she still thinks she's better than anyone else \u2013 perhaps she even thinks that she will need the support of the northern lords if she wishes to seize the North for herself, even if she tries not to think of it. Disturbed at her younger sister's homicidal streak and hurt by the accusations, Sansa tells Arya that she has \"work to do.\"  Much later, Arya stalks Petyr Baelish as he is walking through the grounds of Winterfell. She follows him to his personal quarters and sees him chatting at the door with Maester Wolkan. She eavesdrops on Petyr asking Wolkan if he is sure that \"this\" is the only copy. Assured that it is, Petyr replies that \"Lady Stark thanks him for his services.\" Petyr then briefly enters his room, and leaves once again. Arya enters Petyr's chamber and rummages through his study and furniture. Hidden under his mattress, she finds a scroll. This turns out to be the scroll that Sansa wrote long ago to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Arya, unaware that Sansa had written the letter under duress from Cersei in an attempt to save their father Eddard Stark, looks horrified. She rolls up the scroll and sneaks out of the room, oblivious to a grinning Littlefinger watching from behind a wall.  At Oldtown At the Citadel, a conclave of Maesters read Bran Stark's message warning of the army of the dead but are dismissive of his account. Samwell Tarly, present only to swap out some books, vouches for Bran and tells the Maesters that Bran spent several years surviving in the wilds alone. One Maester mockingly tells Samwell to practice with inscribing instead of entertaining myths and fables. Sam counters that they should use their position as Maesters to warn the people to prepare for the coming Night. Archmaester Ebrose opines that Bran's message could be genuine, but could be disinformation spread by Queen Daenerys. The Maesters agree to send a letter to Winterfell to investigate Bran's claims further, but as they regard the White Walkers as legendary beings akin to the Children of the Forest and the Drowned God, they clearly want to believe Ebrose's misinformation theory. While they agree to investigate Bran's message in further detail, they are skeptical of his claims. After Sam leaves, one of the other Archmaesters asks if it's true that Sam's father and brother were recently burned alive. Ebrose confirms this, and admits that he hasn't had the heart to tell Sam yet.  Later that night, Gilly reads High Septon Maynard's diary. Gilly tells Samwell the High Septon issued an annulment for \"Prince Ragger\" so that he could marry another woman in Dorne. This new marriage indicates that any children Rhaegar may have with this new wife (presumably Lyanna Stark) are his trueborn children and not bastards. The enormity of the discovery is lost on both of them, with Gilly ignorant of Robert's Rebellion and Samwell being preoccupied with his own misery.  Sam and Gilly Eastwatch Samwell voices his frustration to Gilly.  Samwell complains about having to inscribe the bodily functions of High Septon Maynard. In exasperation with his situation, Samwell stalks out of the room and goes to the library. He grabs several books and other items. After a contemplative look at the atrium of the room, he meets Gilly in the courtyard of the Citadel where she and Sam wait for him in a wagon. When Gilly asks if he is sure whether he wants to give up his studies, Samwell replies that he is \"tired of reading about the achievements of better men\", quoting his father. They ride off into the night.  At Dragonstone HBO drogon and Jon Drogon allows Jon to pet him.  The King in the North Jon Snow is walking on the grounds of Dragonstone island when the Dragon Queen Daenerys Targaryen arrives on the back of her dragon Drogon. Drogon roars at Jon at first and stretches out his head to face the King in the North. Drogon calms down and recognizes Jon as a friend of his master (and possibly sensing his Targaryen ancestry?), allowing him to stroke his snout, much to Dany's surprise. When Jon Snow (under slight duress) agrees that the dragons are beautiful beasts, Dany responds that the dragons are her children. When Jon Snow observes that she was not gone for long, Daenerys curtly replies that no she wasn't, and she now has fewer enemies to deal with.  Daenerys then asks Jon about the Battle of the Bastards and him \"taking a knife in the heart for his people\". Jon deflects this and replies that Davos Seaworth likes to embellish things. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of a recently-healed Jorah Mormont. Daenerys introduces Jorah to Jon, who says he worked under Jorah's father in the Night's Watch. When Jorah reaffirms his allegiance to her, she accepts his offer of service and hugs him.  Tyrion and Varys Eastwatch Varys compares Daenerys to Aerys.  Later, Tyrion and Varys talk about the deaths of Randyll and his son Dickon in the Reach. Varys tells Tyrion about how he distanced himself from the Mad King's role in killing Rickard Stark and his son Brandon Stark. Tyrion continues to insist that Daenerys is not her father, and Varys agrees up to a point: Dany may not have her father's madness, but she certainly has a growing ruthless streak, which in Varys' view must be curtailed by Tyrion's more pragmatic counsel. They discuss a sealed scroll containing Bran Stark's message from the North \u2013 which Varys of course, read.  Later, at the Chamber of the Painted Table, Jon tells Daenerys about the news of his half-brother Bran and half-sister Arya Stark's return to Winterfell. He wants to go home to Winterfell, concerned by Bran's vision which warns the army of the dead are getting closer and Jon is worried the undead army will make it past the Wall and advance on the North. Dany notes that Jon doesn't have enough men to fight the army of the dead and Jon asks her again to join him. However, Dany is worried that Cersei will take advantage and march in if she turns her focus to the army of the dead. Tyrion is present and proposes bringing a wight south to King's Landing in order to prove that the army of the dead is real and convince Queen Cersei Lannister, so they can come to a truce. Varys opines that it is suicide trying to appeal to Cersei but Tyrion argues that he can persuade his brother Jaime.  705 Davos Jon Davos and Jon prepare to depart to Eastwatch.  Davos, as the only one who might be able to smuggle Tyrion into King's Landing, reluctantly agrees, but also thinks such a mission is risky even for a smuggler like him. Jorah volunteers to go north to help capture a Wight while Jon volunteers to lead the expedition, since the Free Folk won't follow Jorah and he is the only one who has the most experience facing their enemy. Apparently on the verge of tears about the idea of Jon leaving, Daenerys responds that she did not give Jon permission to leave but Jon reminds her that he is the King in the North. He tells her she has the power of life and death over him but that he trusted her even though she was a stranger. He pleads with her to return the favor by trusting him. Later, Davos and Tyrion chat about smuggling before embarking on their mission to infiltrate King's Landing. Davos plans to find Gendry while Tyrion wants to secretly meet with Jaime to find a peaceful solution to the war.  Dany and Jorah Eastwatch Daenerys bid farewell to Jorah.  Davos and Tyrion return with Gendry to Dragonstone. At the dragonglass mines, they meet Jon Snow, who is supervising the diggings and excavations. Gendry remarks that Jon is a lot shorter than he expected \u2013 and immediately blurts out his true parentage, on the assumption that Jon will value honesty and will appreciate the idea of Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon's bastards joining forces. Gendry volunteers to accompany Jon on his mission to the North to capture a wight and convince Queen Daenerys and Queen Cersei that the true war lies to the North. As Jon Snow and his party, including Jorah Mormont prepare to depart on boats for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Dany and her entourage arrive to bid them farewell. Dany quips to Jorah that they should be used to saying farewell to each other. Jon arrives at the beach as they are saying goodbye. Jon playfully quips to Daenerys that if their mission is unsuccessful and he doesn\u2019t return she at least won\u2019t have to deal with the King in the North anymore. Dany responds that she\u2019s \"grown used to him\", hinting that she may have feelings for him. Jon wishes her good fortune in the wars to come before he leaves. Dany and Tyrion watch as Jon Snow and his party depart on their boats for Eastwatch.  In King's Landing 705 Jaime Jaime returns to King's Landing.  Jaime returns to King's Landing to inform Cersei of the defeat. He flatly insists that the Lannisters have no chance of defeating Daenerys, even if Cersei were able to buy enough mercenaries to replace their huge losses; Qyburn's scorpion did little more than anger Drogon, and neither the Lannister soldiers nor any mercenaries will be able to match the huge horde of Dothraki, who Jaime notes killed their men as if it were sport to them, not war. Cersei snidely asks Jaime if they are expected to surrender to a Queen whose throne Cersei occupies and whose father Jaime betrayed and murdered, mockingly remarking that Tyrion could intercede for them with Daenerys as an apology for killing Joffrey and Tywin.  705 Cersei Lannister Cersei is told of Olenna's role in Joffrey's murder.  Jaime reveals to Cersei that Tyrion is innocent of Joffrey's murder, telling her Olenna Tyrell confessed to it. Cersei is dismissive of Tyrion's innocence in all things as usual, so Jaime has to talk her through it, asking her rhetorically if Olenna would prefer Margaery to marry the strong-willed and sadistic Joffrey or the emotionally pliable and good-natured Tommen. Effectively, Olenna would have become the true ruler of the Seven kingdoms behind the scenes - in the same way that their father Tywin Lannister became the true ruler of Westeros through his grandsons. Feeling cheated of yet another vengeance, Cersei can barely contain her fury as she laments listening to Jaime, saying Olenna ought to have died screaming. Jaime says she's dead, nonetheless, along with the rest of House Tyrell, and that they will go the same way unless they are careful. Jaime sees no other path to victory; Tyrion now stands against his own siblings with a foreign invader possessed of a large, fearsome army and three ferocious dragons. Cersei dismisses his protests, however, making it plain she intends to fight to the death rather than surrender her throne, and expects the same from Jaime and the rest of the Lannister military.  Tyrion and Jaime Eastwatch Tyrion reunites with Jaime.  Later, beneath the Red Keep, Bronn purports to lead Jaime to a sparring session amongst the skulls of the Targaryen dragons, only for him to discover it is really a secret meeting with his estranged brother Tyrion. Jaime is initially angry that Bronn has arranged the secret meeting. Tyrion compliments Jaime on shrewdly and unsentimentally abandoning the Lannister seat of Casterly Rock, while Jaime wishes him dead for killing their father Tywin. Snapping, an emotional Tyrion points out that their father knew he was innocent but still condemned him to death nonetheless, having hated him all his life for being born a dwarf. When Jaime demands to know what Tyrion wants, the dwarf responds that Jaime knows that Daenerys will win the war and tells him that Daenerys is willing to make peace with Cersei under certain conditions. He tells Jaime about Daenerys's terms.  Gendry Eastwatch Gendry is found.  Meanwhile, Davos visits Flea Bottom and eventually finds Gendry in a smithy on the Street of Steel. Joking that he thought Gendry might still be rowing by then, Gendry confirms that no has given him a second glance and realizes that Davos has come to bring him for something important. Having never been happy with serving the family who murdered his father and tried to kill him, Gendry explains that he's been preparing for such a moment and readily agrees to come with him. When Davos warns it will be dangerous and that he should take one of the swords in the shop, Gendry points out he was never taught to fight properly and is only good with a hammer... retrieving from the back of the shop a war hammer, a maul with a stag's head design on either side of the haft socket (likely forged himself and referencing his Baratheon roots).  Later on the shores of Blackwater Bay, Davos and Gendry, having placed his hammer in Davos' boat, prepare to leave but are spotted by a pair of Gold Cloaks. Davos pretends to be a common smuggler and bribes the guards with coin. He strikes up a conversation with the guards and on being asked about his cargo, he shows them he is transporting fermented crab, an aphrodisiac that is popular with the city's brothels. He uncovers the crab while pulling the cloth aside to hide the war hammer and gives each guard a sample. The guards are satisfied, if slightly disgusted, with Davos's explanation and bribe and prepare to depart, but Tyrion arrives at that exact moment; realizing it's too late to turn back and not look suspicious, Tyrion walks past them to the boat while looking downward. However, one of the guards recognizes Tyrion by his scar and asks him to stop. They realize that he is indeed Tyrion Lannister, and immediately see through Davos' deception. With their backs to Gendry and the boat and before they can react, he kills them both by smashing their skulls in with his hammer. Davos, slightly exasperated, introduces Gendry to Tyrion, who wryly observes \"he'll do\".  Got Cersei and Jaime Eastwatch Cersei reveals she is pregnant.  Later, at the Red Keep, Qyburn is visiting Cersei when Jaime enters her chambers. Jaime tells Cersei that he met with Tyrion. When Cersei asks if Daenerys wants to negotiate a surrender, Jaime tells her that Dany is seeking an armistice due to the threat posed by the army of the dead. Cersei knows that Bronn secretly organized the meeting between Tyrion and Jaime. Cersei says that perhaps an alliance with Daenerys may be a wiser move, but she still retains her determination to destroy any force that stands against her. She also asks if Jaime plans to punish Bronn for arranging the clandestine meeting with Tyrion. She also reveals that she is pregnant with another of Jaime's children, one who she believes will someday be the heir to the Iron Throne. After reflecting on their late father's advice that \"the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep\", Cersei hugs Jaime and whispers in his ear that he is never to betray her again.  At Eastwatch-by-the-Sea After landing at Eastwatch, Jon Snow and his band meet with the Wildling Tormund, who thinks that Jon's plan is suicidal, and mockingly asks which of the two ferocious Queens is it they need to convince (Jon replies both). Davos volunteers to stay behind at Eastwatch because he regards himself as a liability, given his age and relative lack of fighting ability. They later learn that the Night's Watch has detained members of the Brotherhood Without Banners including Beric Dondarrion, Thoros and Sandor Clegane. Jon and his team meet with the prisoners in the icy cells beneath Eastwatch, where the entire group swiftly establishes their reasons for hating each other. Gendry opines that they should not trust Thoros because the Brotherhood sold him to the Red Witch, raising Davos and Jon's hackles. Thoros, in turn, is surprised to see Jorah, an old comrade and rival from the Siege of Pyke.  GoT 7crew-jon-tormund-davos-gendry-sandor-thoros-jorah-baric-eastwatch The Wight Hunt begins.  While the Wildlings, Mormont, and the Brotherhood Without Banners distrust each other, they decide to put aside their differences to fight against the army of the dead. Sandor quips that the cells are freezing. After they are freed, Jon, Jorah, Tormund, Gendry, Sandor, Beric, and Thoros exit Eastwatch's gate and set out into the lands beyond the Wall on their dangerous mission to capture a Wight to bring to Daenerys and Cersei."], "review": ["Previously in Season Seven of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019\u2026Brought to you through the medium of TV TropesOne of the big mysteries in ASOIAF is whether the Others bring the cold, or whether the cold brings the Others.In the show, it\u2019s clear why Winter Is Coming\u2026\u2026 the amount of Fridge Logic has increased somewhat exponentially.\u2018Fridge Logic has been the writer's-room term for these little Internal Consistency issues for a good while, as in \"Don't sweat the Fridge Logic, we've got bigger fish to fry.

In both the real and fictional worlds, eating fermented crabs is a cast-iron guarantee of not getting far enough to find out. Davos owes Gendry big time for war hammering those two Goldcloaks before they got a chance to sue him for false advertising.Jaime and Cersei\u2018Cersei is a lying whore, she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know\u2019 - Tyrion, A Storm of SwordsJaime: Am I the father?Cersei: Yes.Oh dear me.\u2026 in the CitadelThe Maesters are arguing over Brexit, but Sam is too busy ranting to notice the pay-off from his home-schooling of Gilly in Chekhov\u2019s Skill.Extra points for the musical score accompanying Sam in the library, as he steals all the books about Horcruxes. It has its own theme.In WinterfellBranOne benefit of Bran\u2019s wireless access to the weirwoodwideweb is that he can be a normal teenager and play Angry Birds from the comfort of his own home.Since his return from the Hidden Elf Village, he\u2019s had a lot on his mind, like the whole of Time and Space. He catapults the Angry Ravens with his brain, but unfortunately fails to Scam Cthulhu.However, if the Night\u2019s King can detect Bran Beyond the Wall and catapult his consciousness out of the Angry Birds, then logically it follows that, if Bran gets stronger, he might be able to catapult the Night\u2019s King out of the Wights.Maybe Bran should try Squirrel Surveillance next time:The Tale of Littlefinger Who Has Not Been Murdered.Littlefinger started off as a Magnificent Bastard, but he\u2019s rapidly degraded to a Smug Snake that makes no sense.Robin Arryn has still not returned from being Put On A Bus plotwise, unlike Gendry who\u2019s been allowed out for a comfort break, before reboarding.Robin Arryn - who implausibly stands between Littlefinger and his death - has been on that bus for so long, without any adult supervision, that, if he does reappear they\u2019ll be three of him at once.Side note: the Dothraki - all 100,000 of them must sympathesise - having been Put On A Bus for two episodes along with all their horses, beards, and pointy, pointy arakhs before, finally, getting a bit of fresh air on a battlefield thick with choking death smoke, fire and arakh fodder.Littlefinger had a royal flush for five seasons before setting fire to his cards, because that\u2019s what the cleverest, most cunning man in the Whole of Westeros does.

I\u2019m done fucking with it and if you don\u2019t already know that this is a garbage thing to do, I have no interest in engaging with you, ever. (If you have an actual edit, like a typo or grammar mistake or factual error/clarification, please proceed.)*cracks knuckles* Let\u2019s go.Jaime\u2019s alive, as we all pretty much knew he had to be. I have no idea of the logistics of Bronn dragging an armored guy whom we last saw sinking quickly to the shore of this \u2026 lake \u2026 thing, but OK. Bronn, being Bronn, tells Jaime that Jaime can\u2019t die until Bronn gets paid. Jaime\u2019s understandably dazed at the prospect of fighting multiple dragons.Tyrion gets to walk through ashes to a melancholy version of \u201cRains of Castamere.\u201d Dany has some of the survivors around her and gives the spiel about not being there to murder anyone, leave the world better than she found it, blah blah. Does anyone actually believe this? It\u2019s one thing to say, \u201cI won, you lost, might makes right.\u201d But having just massacred hundreds of people, I\u2019m not sure someone gets to give the \u201cgreat liberator\u201d spiel.The Tarlys get burned alive. I give the show credit for not having Randyll make some sexist/rape quip before dying. His rationale is a fair one, and you also respect Dickon for going with his father. Tyrion is troubled by the whole thing. The soldiers kneel to Dany because they\u2019re scared shitless of her dragon, and for no other reason. The Tarlys probably fall just far enough along the asshole spectrum for casual viewers to cheer on what Dany is doing.Jaime tries to talk sense into Cersei. Cersei\u2019s nuts, but \u2026 she\u2019s not wrong here. Dany has no reason to make offers. I am surprised that Jaime actually told Cersei the truth about Olenna; I thought he\u2019d keep it to himself. I\u2019m sure Cersei still hates Tyrion, for obvious reasons, but this might be a small source of a ceasefire between the two of them in the future.Dany returns to Dragonstone on Drogon. Jon stands his ground against the dragons and pets him. I know everyone will be all, \u201cIt\u2019s because Jon\u2019s a Targaryen!\u201d But a bonded dragon is in tune with the feelings of its rider. Meaning, Drogon and Dany have a connection going on, and Drogon tolerating Jon or showing Jon any sort of ease is probably more about Dany\u2019s opinion of Jon than Jon being a Targaryen. (If it were one of the unbonded dragons, you might be able to argue the Targaryen thing. But that\u2019s probably not what this is.)Interestingly, Jon is left unaware of the specifics of what Dany did to the Tarlys. I have to wonder if it matters at all or if it\u2019s an important point that he just doesn\u2019t seem to know. Jon would understand the whole \u201crule from a position of strength\u201d thing. \u201cBurning prisoners alive,\u201d though, not so much.Jorah\u2019s back just in time to be friendzoned again. Dany takes him back into her service and it\u2019s like he never left. And again I have to wonder why they gave Jorah greyscale if he was going to be so easily cured. Was it important that he was absent during Dany\u2019s early blunders? Was it to give Sam something to do? Was it to lay the groundwork for Sam realizing he inadvertently helped the woman who killed his family? It could get either very complex or very stupid, plausibly, in either direction.Bran wargs an entire murder of crows. (Ravens? Crows? Whatever. Is it still a murder if it\u2019s ravens? EDIT: An unkindness of ravens, thanks) He sees the Night King\u2019s army on the march and the Night King seems able to \u201cthrow\u201d Bran out of the birds, which is interesting. Poor Maester Wolkan has to write scrolls to everywhere telling everyone about what the crippled kid saw through the eyes of a bunch of birds.Sam\u2019s doing bitchwork at the Citadel still. The maesters are skeptical of Bran\u2019s story and Sam tries to vouch for the story. Sam gets frustrated when the maesters don\u2019t take the threat seriously, especially because the maesters are one of the few groups with the authority to tell people what to do. We get a nice Jenny of Oldstones Easter egg. The sequence ends with us learning that Sam doesn\u2019t know what happened to Randyll and Dickon.Varys and Tyrion are talking about Dany and even Varys is drinking. We get a taste of what life was like under Aerys, and Varys seems to think Dany can avoid becoming Aerys if Tyrion gets her to listen. Here\u2019s the thing: We\u2019re getting to the point of \u201cput up, or shut up\u201d with Dany and her \u2026 proclivities. At some point, this has to matter. There needs to be a payoff with this kind of talk and with the Tarlys and everything else. If absolutely nothing comes of this, why bother? If Dany is so great, why is she doing this? When Tyrion and Varys are talking about it, in-story, you can\u2019t just wave it off as anti-Dany bias. We\u2019re meant to see that people in-story are troubled by what she\u2019s doing. So where is it going?I liked Jon a lot this episode. He\u2019s been a little bland this season so far, but you get a spark of Jon when he tells Dany (who after all this is still talking like she can keep him there against his will) he can go whenever he damn well pleases.The group works up a plan to have Jon and Co. bring a wight back from beyond the Wall to prove to Cersei and everyone that the threat is real. This sets up the season\u2019s set-piece episode next week. Jorah volunteers to go, and so does Jon.Winterfell. Sansa\u2019s holding off the restless lords who are starting to regret naming Jon their king. Arya watches the proceedings. Sansa and Arya have a nice scene in Sansa\u2019s room (Ned and Catelyn\u2019s old room). You finally get a sense of how brute-force Arya\u2019s become (just behead them!) and Sansa has to talk sense into her. Arya\u2019s right that the men shouldn\u2019t be insulting Jon, but Sansa\u2019s also right about keeping her coalition together. Arya accuses Sansa of wanting Jon to not come back so she can be Queen in the North. The Stark sisters\u2019 animosity is troubling; I hope these kids work it out.Davos smuggles Tyrion into King\u2019s Landing. Bronn lures Jaime to the dungeons where Tyrion is waiting. Tyrion gives a bit of a sob story before Jaime tells him to shut the fuck up, mercifully. Tyrion gives Jaime the terms and Jaime has to take them to Cersei.Davos turns up Gendry, who has a nice warhammer now, like Robert. I know we all wanted Gendry to come back, we were expecting it, but can we just admit that it feels a little convoluted that Davos happens to get back to King\u2019s Landing (what if Tyrion hadn\u2019t needed to go?) and happens to find Gendry who happens to be ready to go, man! I\u2019m happy he\u2019s back, but \u2026 yeah. They pushed the Staples easy button there. Gendry bashes some Lannister soldiers\u2019 heads in with his hammer, and Tyrion\u2019s a fan!Jaime comes in to tell Cersei the terms and Cersei immediately tries to see how they can benefit from it through a double-cross, after telling Jaime she knew about the Tyrion meeting and let it happen. Then we find out Cersei is pregnant and \u2026 you know what, fuck it, I\u2019m kind of \u2026 happy for them? You know the kid is doomed (three kids, remember!), but \u2026 it\u2019s bizarrely touching.This is probably the biggest under-the-radar moment of the episode and I bet at least half the viewership missed it. Sam\u2019s frustrated with the maesters and Gilly\u2019s showing off her reading skills. We find out that a High Septon Maynard granted an annulment to a Prince \u201cRagger,\u201d and then conducted a secret wedding ceremony in Dorne. Sam barrels through with his ranting against the maesters. But basically we just got confirmation that Rhaegar had an annulment from Elia Martell, he married Lyanna Stark in Dorne, and Jon is not a bastard. I have been arguing this for goddamn years, so you\u2019ll forgive me a short moment of fist-pumping. (I\u2019d always guessed it was polygamy, and it might yet be in the books; it\u2019s possible the show used an annulment because it was easier to explain. Either way, go me.)The stupid editor cut off the last part of my review when the question was merged and I lost it. I\u2019m too tired to write it all over again but: The Arya-Littlefinger-Sansa stuff has to be resolved this season; I liked Jon and Gendry\u2019s meeting; Tormund was hilarious and \u201cThe one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?\u201d \u201cBoth\u201d was amazing; the issue with Dany\u2019s violence and Varys and Tyrion being concerned about it has to come to a head at some point; this was a nice episode for a set-up piece even if parts of it were pretty overly convenient.I need to remember to type the review outside of Quora so I don\u2019t lose it, from now on. Annoying as shit.", "I enjoyed this episode for the simple fact it brought back a number of likeable characters and actually put them all on a quest together. The magnificent seven rides again. Only thing better would be if they included Brienne, but I think her ultimate role is going to be socking Littlefinger in the gip.I think the most entertaining thing in the episode was watching Gendry meet Jon.Didn\u2019t like Dany burning up the Tarlys. I understand why she did it but it was a bit draconian, especially killing Dickon. People gave me crap about calling Edmure a coward (which he WAS), but at least Dickon and Lord Tarly went out like knights are supposed to.I\u2019m not really buying Dany\u2019s argument that Cersei is the real enemy when she\u2019s BBQing enemy prisoners when they don\u2019t accept her. She\u2019s becoming more and more a chip off the ol block and that\u2019s why Jon is the true King. Looks like they are setting up Jon to ride a dragon. Probably the white one.Speaking of Jon, A bunch of people were proven wrong since they confirmed that Rhaegar actually married Lyanna which is what I always figured. (I thought he had two wives like Aegon the Conqueror though) I bet that Robert probably even knew it too because Lyanna seems like the type that would tell him and Robert\u2019s Rebellion was partially spawned out of spite.Bronn as usual is one of the only people acting like a person would really act. \u201cDragons? That\u2019s where our partnership ends. I\u2019m outta here. Good luck.\u201dI also didn\u2019t like the scene between Jaime and Tyrion. It was a bit forced and both characters took the encounter a bit too lightly. Jaime should have at least choked him or something. Looks like they are setting up Tyrion to be Dany\u2019s last betrayer. At this point I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it turns out Tyrion is actually the Mad King\u2019s illegit kid too and he steals the green dragon and takes him to the Lannister side.Cersei is a bit too relaxed and hardcore considering Jaime tells her how they got their asses kicked, the scorpion didn\u2019t work and and that was only one dragon. She kind of Godfathered Jaime with the \u2018dont ever betray me again\u2019 line.Jaime actually said that the Dothraki actually outclassed their army. That disproves the theory that the Lannister army would have beaten the Dothraki without the dragon.I wonder what will happen if Lady Mormont meets Jorah? That probably wont go so well.Arya has turned into a complete asshole. Even though her anger seems a bit justified when watching Sansa because she sees Sansa enjoys the authority.I knew Littlefinger was setting her up. Apparently the note was the letter that Sansa wrote after Robert died. (I paused it and read a bit of it) Seems like Littlefinger is trying to sow dissent between the Stark kids because the note makes it look like Sansa sold out their dad.Wasn\u2019t buying the Stark bannermen already rabbling when Jon\u2019s not there. Especially the ones that BS\u2019d and sat out the Battle of the Bastards.It was cool seeing Sam do what he did. They kind of made him out to be a dick last season but he\u2019s turning it around this one."]}, "66": {"id": "s07e06", "name": "Beyond the Wall", "script": "1  You alright?  Haven't been North before?  Never seen snow before.  Beautiful, eh? I can breathe again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit.  - You've never been down south. - I've been to Winterfell.  That's the North.  How do you live up here?  How d'you keep your balls from freezing off?  You've got to keep moving, that's the secret.  Walking's good, fighting's better,  fucking's best.  There's not a living woman within 100 miles from here.  We've got to make do with what we've got.  This one is maybe not so smart.  - Davos says he's a strong fighter. - Good.  That's more important than being smart.  Smart people don't come here looking for the dead.  So, you've met this Dragon queen, huh? And?  She will only fight beside us if I bend the knee.  You spent too much time with the Free Folk. Now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man. Proud man.  The King Beyond the Wall and never bent the knee.  How many of us people died for his pride?  You still mad at us, boy?  - You sold me to a witch. - A priestess.  I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.  We're fighting a great war.  - Wars cost money. - I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off.  Like a slave.  You know what she did to me?  She struck me down on the bed, she stripped me naked  Sounds alright so far  And put leeches on me!  - Was she naked too? - She needed your blood.  - Yes, thank you, I know that. - Could've been worse.  She wanted to kill me.  - And would have killed me if it weren't for - But they didn't, did they?  So what you winging about?  I'm not winging.  Your lips are moving and you complain about something. That's winging.  This one has been killed six times and you don't hear him bitching about it.  Good lad.  The first time I went north of the Wall, was with your father.  He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?  I was a prisoner of the wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that, every mutineer found justice.  Can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men.  And they butchered him.  I hate that he died that way.  And my father was the most honorable man I have ever met.  He was good, all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.  Your father wanted to execute me, you know.  I heard.  It was in the right, of course.  Didn't make me hate him any less.  I'm glad he didn't catch you.  Your father gave me this sword.  Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf.  But it's still Longclaw.  Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.  But you are back.  And it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.  He gave it to you.  I'm not his son.  I brought shame onto my house.  I broke my father's heart.  I forfeited the right to claim his sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well.  And your children after you.  Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember, you were inside knitting all the time.  I remember.  One times the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick,  I came out here after  and Bran had left his bow behind,  just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target  and with no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go up there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally, I've hit the bull's eye.  Could've been the 20th shot. Or the 50th. I don't remember.  But I hit the bull's eye.  And I heard this.  I looked up.  And he was standing right here, smiling down on me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules  but he was smiling, so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters.  With your help.  What?  That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles cause I couldn't write as well as you.  Robb,  I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  - Killed from wounds he took in a bull - You don't have to read it.  - I remember. - Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey  and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey  and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark  Your faithful sister, Sansa.  - They forced me to do it. - Did they?  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you in a rack and stretched you till your bones started to crack?  You should have known what it was like. I was a child.  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.  They told me it was the only way to save father.  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you, standing on that platform  with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father to the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing, the fancy way you did your hair.  - You were there. - I was there.  Standing in the crown near Baelor's statue.  And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight with the Lannisters and save father?  - I wanted to. - But you didn't.  - Just like me. - I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray my entire family for my beloved Joffrey.  You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back, he lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knights of the Vale have won the battle and they rode north for me.  While you were where? Travelling the world?  - I was training. - Training?  Well, while you were training, I suffered things you can never imagine.  Oh, I didn't know that and I can imagine quite a lot.  You never would have survived what I survived.  I guess we'll never know.  What are you going to do with that letter?  I don't know yet.  Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?  You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's gonna hang you. You're scared I'll show it to Jon  - Arya! - and he'll be angry.  Not, that's not Jon.  He'll understand, you were just a scared little girl.  All alone with the wicked Lannisters.  Do you know how happy Cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants, what she always wanted.  You are scared the Northern lords will read it.  They wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say \"But I was just a child\"?  You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.  You're the one they call the dog.  Fuck off.  They told me you were mean.  Were your born mean or you just hate wildlings?  I could not give two shits about wildlings.  Gingers I hate.  Gingers are beautiful.  Kissed by fire.  Just like you.  Don't point your fucking finger at me.  Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?  I didn't trip, I was pushed.  Ever since, you've been mean.  Fuck off.  I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.  You want to suck my dick, is that it?  - Dick? - Cock.  Ah, dick.  I like it.  Bet you do.  Nop, it's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back in Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair,  blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.  Brienne of Tarth?  - You know her? - Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth?  Well, not with her yet.  But I see the way she looks at me.  How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?  You do know her.  We've met.  I want to make babies with her.  Think of them.  Great big monsters.  They conquer the world.  How did a mad fucker like you live this long?  I'm good at killing people.  - You don't look much like him. - Who's that?  Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.  You knew him?  Of course I did.  When he was Hand.  He sent me off hunting for the Mountain.  Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back  six times.  We both serve the same lord.  I serve the North.  The North didn't raise you from the dead.  The Lord of Light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.  He wants your life.  - Why? - I don't know.  That's what anyone can tell me. I don't know.  So what's the point of serving a god, none of us knows what he wants?  I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand.  Except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit in a throne made of swords.  So what are you fighting for?  Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy.  And the last.  But we all die.  The enemy always wins.  But we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I won't find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep up the life.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.  I am the shield that guards the realm of men.  Maybe we don't need to understand anymore than that.  Maybe that's enough.  Aye.  Maybe that's enough.  That's what I saw in the fire.  A mountain like an arrow head.  Are you sure?  We're getting close.  Do you know what I like about you?  - I honestly don't. - You're not a hero.  Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.  I once charged through the Mud Gate of King's Landing.  I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this  Jon Snow.  They all try to outdo each other.  You can do the stupidest bravest thing  It's interesting, these heroes you name  Drogo, Jorah,  Daarios, even this  Jon Snow  They all fell in love with you.  Jon Snow is not in love with me.  Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.  He's too little for me.  I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean  As heroes go he is quite little.  I know you're brave.  I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.  So  if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister.  From everything you've told me about her  she'd rather murder me than speak with me.  Oh  first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you.  Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me.  But if we go to the capital,  we'll go with two armies,  we'll go with three dragons,  and anyone touches you,  King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.  And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.  Of course she is.  And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.  Are we?  Laying any traps?  If we want to create a new and better world,  I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.  Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?  Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne.  You need to inspire a degree of fear.  But fear is all Cersei has.  It's all my father had And Joffrey.  It makes their power brittle.  Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.  Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.  He did.  But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel.  Aegon built the wheel.  If that's the kind of queen you want to be,  how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?  So we walk into the lion's den?  My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.  Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises.  Except yours.  And I promised him  I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.  Impulsive?  This will be a difficult negotiation.  We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless.  My sister is likely to say something provocative.  And?  And you've been known to lose your temper from time to time.  - As all our great leaders do - When have I lost my temper?  Burning the Tarlys for instance.  That was not impulsive.  That was necessary.  - Perhaps. - Perhaps.  Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son.  Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell.  We had no time to discuss the possibilities  before you ended their possibilities.  One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.  I am taking their side.  You need to take your enemy's side  if you're going to see things the way they do.  And you need to see things the way they do  if you're going to anticipate their actions,  respond effectively and beat them.  Which I want you to do very much.  Because I believe in you  and the world you want to build.  But the world you want to build  doesn't get built all at once. Probably not in a single lifetime.  How do we ensure your vision endures?  After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?  You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead?  You say you can't have children.  But there are other ways of choosing a successor.  The Night's Watch has one method,  The Iron born folk,  although many flaws  We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.  Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush,  and I saw hundred of arrows miss.  But any one of them could have found your heart and end  You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you?  Is this one of the items you've discussed with your brother in King's Landing?  I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.  Perhaps if you'd planned for the short term,  we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.  We will discuss the succession  after I wear the crown.  Prepare.  Big fucker.  Do bears have blue eyes?  We have to get him back to Eastwatch.  Flask.  Go on.  You alright?  I just got bit by a dead bear.  Aye.  You did.  Funny old life.  Alright then.  - Where did she get it? - I don't know.  She seems very resourceful.  You're worried.  We're asking 20 000 men to fight with us  in the worst winter any of them have ever seen.  The weather will be the least of their problem.  Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.  You question their loyalty?  Their loyalty is to Jon.  Jon is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.  You're the Lady of Winterfell.  The King chose you to rule in his absence.  And rule you have.  Wisely.  Ably.  They say that, they respect you.  Some may even prefer you.  Yes, they turned their backs on Jon  when it was time to retake Winterfell  and then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again.  How far would you trust men like that?  They're all bloody wind vanes.  If they found out I wrote that letter  a woman who's already married not one but two enemies of her House  By the time Jon comes back, he'll have no army left.  Arya is not like them.  She's your sister.  You may have disagreements, but she would never betray her family.  She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.  Is that what she thinks?  I don't know what she thinks.  I don't know her anymore.  Perhaps Lady Brienne can help.  She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls.  Did she not?  She is.  And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way,  wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?  She would.  Something I've always wanted to know.  Alright.  How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?  For being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach.  Some of the lads told me about it the next morning.  Sounded like a good scrap.  Aye.  It was a proper scrap.  The Ironborn thought you were some kind of god.  The way you were waving that flaming sword.  I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.  Just the drunkest.  Where's the rest of them?  If we wait long enough we will find out.  Go back to Eastwatch.  Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened.  - I'm not leaving you. - You're the fastest.  Go! Now!  You're faster without the hammer. Give it!  Give it!  Stop!  Go!  What happened?  Where are the others?  Raven.  We need to send the raven.  Get the maester! Now!  Thoros?  Thoros!  I say it's one of the better ways to go.  Lord of Light,  show us the way.  Come to us in our darkness and lead your servant into the light.  We have to burn this body.  And all the clothes behind him.  Unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.  Come to us in our darkness.  For the night is dark and full of terrors.  We'll all freeze soon.  I saw the water.  When you killed the white walker,  almost all the dead that followed it fell.  Why?  Maybe he was the one who turned them.  We can go for the walkers.  - Maybe we'll stand a chance. - No.  We need to take that thing back with us.  There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now.  Daenerys is our only chance.  No.  There's another.  Kill him.  He turned them all.  You don't understand  The Lord brought you back  he brought me back  No one else, just us.  Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?  Careful, Beric, you've lost your priest.  This is your last life.  I've been waiting for the end for a long time.  Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.  Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt.  Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.  Milady.  Milady.  It's an invitation.  To King's Landing.  - Milady, you are the Lady of Winterfell. - I am.  And you will represent my interest at this gathering as you see them.  They invited you, they want you there.  I will not set foot in King's Landing while  Cersei Lannister is queen.  They want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me.  Until then, I'll remain where I belong.  I have work to do here.  It's not safe.  Ser Jaime will be there.  You said he treated you honourably before.  I'm not worried about me.  It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.  I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him  whether or not you're here.  And you trust their loyalty?  You trust he hasn't been speaking to them behind your back?  Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.  He has become a competent swordsman.  I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.  I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home.  This is the safest place for me.  Milady.  I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister.  If I abandon you  The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne,  and you won't be travelling on summer roads.  The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time.  Yes, Milady.  You can't!  The most important person in the world can't fly to the most dangerous place in the world.  - Who else can? - No one.  They knew the risk when they left.  You can't win the throne if you're dead.  You can't break the wheel if you're dead.  - So what would you have me do? - Nothing.  Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do.  If you die  we're all lost.  Everyone, everything  You told me to do nothing before and I've listened to you.  I'm not doing nothing again.  Damn cunt.  Oh, fuck.  Fall back!  Fall back!  Come on!  Help me!  Jon!  Go!  Go now! Leave!  Uncle Benjen! How?  You ride for the pass.  Come with me.  It's not time.  Go!  We'll meet again, Clegane.  Fucking hope not.  It's time to go, Your Grace.  A bit longer.  Not what you're looking for?  I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me.  They're not here now.  - What are these? - My faces.  - Where did you get them? - In Braavos,  while I was training to be a faceless man.  What does that mean?  Back in Braavos, before I got my first face,  there was I game I used to play. The game of faces.  It's simple: I ask you a question about yourself  and you try to make a lie sound like the truth.  If you fool me, you win.  If I catch a lie, you lose.  Let's play.  I don't want to play.  How do you feel about Jon being king?  Is there someone else you feel should rule the North instead of him?  Those faces, what are they?  Is that what you should be asking?  Are you sure?  The game of faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions.  Tell me what they are!  We both wanted to be other people when we were younger.  You wanted to be a queen.  To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne.  I wanted to be a knight  To pick up a sword like father and go off to battle.  Neither of us got to be the other person, did we?  The world doesn't just let girls decide what they are going to be.  But I can now. With the faces I can choose.  I can become someone else.  Speak in their voice, live in their skin.  I can even become you.  I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses.  To be the Lady of Winterfell.  All I'd need to find out  is your face.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I wish I could take it back.  I wish we'd never go.  I don't.  If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen.  You have to see it to know.  Now I know.  The dragons are my children.  They're the only children I'll ever have. Do you understand?  We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.  And we'll do it together.  You have my word.  Thank you, Dany.  Dany  Who was the last person who called me that?  I'm not sure, was it my brother?  Not the company you want to keep.  Alright.  Not Dany.  How about \"My Queen\"?  I'd  bend the knee but  What about those who swore allegiance to you?  They'll all come to see you for what you are.  I hope I deserve it.  You do.  You should get some rest.", "summary": ["Plot Jon and the Brotherhood hunt the dead. Arya confronts Sansa. Tyrion thinks about the future.   Summary At Winterfell Sansa-Arya-Beyond-the-Wall Sansa confronts Arya on her behaviour.  At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death.  Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay.  Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear.  Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice.  Sansa-Brienne-Beyond-the-Wall Sansa sends Brienne south to Parley with Cersei.  The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.  Following the events of the Wight Hunt, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several \"faces\", including the literally late Walder Frey's face. Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the \"faces\" are.  706 Episode 66 Sansa learns about the Faceless Men.  Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger.  The Wight Hunt Tyrion-Daenerys-Beyond-the-Wall Tyrion and Daenerys discuss a possible armistice.  At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to \"heroes\" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom \"do stupid things, trying to outdo the others\". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her \u2013 to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward. The two then turn their attention to the topic of their impending meeting with Queen Cersei in King's Landing. Tyrion admits that Cersei cannot be trusted and could be setting a trap for them, but that Daenerys will have the Unsullied, the Dothraki and her dragons at hand; if anyone tries to harm her, King's Landing will be leveled in response.  Daenerys wonders whether, given that Cersei will almost certainly be attempting to double-cross them, they should be planning something similar. Tyrion is firmly against any deceit, counseling Daenerys that while she needs a healthy degree of fear to instill respect, she cannot rule through fear alone, as leaders who rule through fear alone like Cersei, Tywin, and Joffrey are hated by their people and forever vulnerable to being overthrown. Tyrion reminds Daenerys about her vision of creating a new society by \"breaking the wheel\" rather than merely imitating prior rulers like Aegon Targaryen, and cautions her about her temper and impulsiveness, citing the fiery executions of Lord Randyll Tarly and his son Dickon. Daenerys asserts that such an action was necessary, but Tyrion still believes she should have attempted more merciful means of dealing with the problem the Tarlys posed, or at least left them alive long enough to consider her other options rather than having them summarily executed. As Daenerys becomes increasingly agitated in the face of Tyrion's blunt but reasonable remarks, he reassures Daenerys that he supports her vision and ideals. Tyrion also proposes that Daenerys consider a succession plan in the event of a disaster, given that by her own admission, she believes she is incapable of bearing children. She refuses to consider this plan until she has donned the crown, also coldly blaming Tyrion's policy of caution for causing her the loss of Highgarden, Ellaria Sand, and Yara Greyjoy.  706 Tormund Beric Sandor Jon Jorah Gendry Tormund and Jon compare wildlings and northmen.  Jon Snow and his ranging party travel through the lands beyond the wall on their mission to capture a wight. Gendry complains about the bitter cold and asks Tormund about life as a Wildling. Tormund later confides with Jon about the foolhardy nature of their mission, while Jon discusses his difficult negotiations with Daenerys. Tormund points out that the pride of the Northmen may cost them too many lives, citing Mance Rayder and the Wildlings as an example. While walking, Gendry also confronts the Brotherhood Without Banners about selling him off as a sacrifice to Melisandre. Sandor Clegane sneers that Gendry should be grateful that he is still alive and points out that Beric Dondarrion has been killed six times (not mentioning one of those was by Sandor himself) \"and you don't hear him bitching about it\". Not entirely sure what to think of that particular revelation, Gendry accepts a drink from Thoros's wineskin.  While walking, Jon and Jorah Mormont also chat about their relationships with their fathers Eddard Stark and Jeor Mormont respectively. They say that their fathers were good and honorable men and did not deserve their deaths. Jon tells Jorah about the brutal death of Jeor at the hands of the Mutineers and that Eddard was beheaded. Jon tries to return to Jorah his father's Valyrian sword Longclaw but Jorah tells him that he is not worthy to bear his father's sword, having forfeited any claim to it when he brought shame into his House. His father gave the sword to Jon, and gives his blessing for Jon and his future children to keep it.  Later, Sandor and Tormund trade jabs about sex. Sandor takes offense when Tormund asks about how he burnt his face. Tormund then confides in Sandor about his infatuation for Brienne of Tarth, who is nearly as tall as Sandor. He jokes about having \"monstrous\" babies with her, to Sandor's utter bewilderment. Beric and Jon talk about Eddard Stark and how they have both been resurrected by worshipers of the Lord of Light. Beric tells Jon that he is fighting for life because death is the first and last enemy; it is inevitable, but it is human nature to fight it for as long as you can. He warns Jon that they have to work together to fight death and defend those who cannot defend themselves. Jon reflects on his Night's Watch oath about being the \"shield that guards the realms of men\" and agrees. Sandor sees the mountain from his vision lying ahead and steers the group in that direction.  While trudging through a snowstorm, Jon and his party sight a massive snow bear with blue eyes approaching them. The snow bear turns out to have been resurrected by a White Walker. The monstrous creature mauls and kills three of their company. Beric and Thoros manage to set the snow bear alight with his flaming sword but it continues to attack, forcing Thoros to get in its' way when it attacks Sandor, who is too terrified of the flames engulfing the beast even to defend himself. Thoros is unable to break free of its jaws until Jorah kills it with a dragonglass dagger. Beric cauterizes Thoros' wounds with his flaming sword.  Jorah asks the wounded Thoros about his experience charging with a flaming sword during the Siege of Pyke, and commends his old comrade for his drunken bravery. While navigating through the mountain, they see a White Walker leading a column of Wights marching through the canyon below. The ranging party plants a fire and then ambushes them when the White Walker stops to investigate. Jon manages to kill the White Walker with Longclaw, causing most of the Wights associated with it to disintegrate, while the rest of the group manages to capture the only unaffected wight. The creature unexpectedly screeches for help; Sandor slaps his gloved hand over its mouth, but it wrenches its face away when its mouth skin tears off into the glove, to Sandor and Jorah's disgust. As Jorah pulls out a bag from his jacket and secures it over its head, Sandor and Tormund bind the creature with a coil of rope. In the middle of this, they realize their captive's howls have drawn the attention of a massive host of wights now heading their way, hastening their work.  As the noise of the horde approaches, Jon sends Gendry, over his protest, back to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to bring news to Daenerys as he's the fastest. Gendry gives his war hammer to Tormund, who hands it to Sandor who has the wight slung over his shoulder. The wights pursue the group over a lake of weak ice, as they flee toward a large stone island jutting out in the middle. One of the party trips and falls behind; a few of the horde tackles him, the combined weight breaks the ice, and they fall through. This causes a chain reaction of breaking ice all around the rock until the horde slows to a stop to avoid the water. Throughout the night, Jon and his comrades wait in the middle of the ice while encircled by the army of the undead. Meanwhile, Gendry reaches Eastwatch's outer gates but collapses from exhaustion. Davos Seaworth and several guards attend to him. When Davos asks what happened, Gendry tells him to prepare a raven; Davos orders to bring the Maester.  In the morning, Jon and his company awake to find that Thoros has died from his wounds. Beric and Sandor pay their last respects, with the former praying for the Lord of Light to guard them as the latter assures him freezing to death is said to be one of the better ways to die. At Jon's insistence, they burn the body with Beric's flaming sword so Thoros can't be reanimated. The wights watch while their captive Wight struggles under its hood and restraints. Jorah proposes killing the wight but Jon counters that they need to keep it as evidence. Beric suggests that Jon kill the Night King, who has just arrived on horseback; given that they've seen killing a Walker destroyed the wights it controlled, killing the Night King might destroy them all. He then adds that the Lord of Light has not resurrected Jon for no reason, but Sandor reminds him that they have just lost their priest, and Beric is now down to his last life.  706 Tyrion Daenerys Exterior Daenerys prepares to leave for Eastwatch.  After receiving Gendry's message from Eastwatch, Tyrion implores Queen Daenerys, who has donned a cold-weather version of her Targaryen garb, not to leave for the North because it is too risky, insisting that Jon and his companions knew the risks of their mission and that if Daenerys dies beyond the Wall, everything they've done will be for nothing. Daenerys counters that he told her to do nothing before and she lost. Dissatisfied with his advice, Dany leaves with all three dragons to the lands beyond the Wall to aid Jon Snow and his ranging party.  706 Army of the Dead Beyond the Wall The army of the dead attack the living.  Bored, Sandor hurls two rocks at one of the undead minions, knocking its jaw off. The second however, skids across the ice, and both the party and the undead quickly realize the ice, which has hardened overnight, is strong enough to support their weight, and in ever-increasing numbers, the horde attacks the group's position. Sandor holds them back with Gendry's hammer while Jon and the other members of the ranging party join in, wielding weapons of fire, dragonglass or Valyrian steel. Beric manages to set several of the wights alight with his flaming sword. The ranging party hack and slash at the wights with their blades but are unable to stem the tide. With the group overwhelmed, Jon orders them to fall back to the highest part of the island. Tormund is overwhelmed by several wights and is nearly dragged under the ice, but is saved by Sandor, who drags him back onto the island. The group continues fighting against the wights. One of the Wildlings falls off a ledge and is ripped apart by the creatures, who begin to scramble up the ledge towards the living.  When all seems lost, Queen Daenerys arrives with her dragons, who attack the wights with dragonfire. Hundreds of wights are burned to ashes while others collapse under the ice, which is melted by dragonfire. Jon and his party rush to Daenerys and her dragon Drogon, dragging their captive wight with them, while Viserion and Rhaegal provide covering fire from above. Meanwhile, the Night King obtains an icy javelin from one of his lieutenants and hurls it at Viserion, scoring a direct hit. Viserion is struck in the neck and plunges helplessly into freefall, shrieking in agony as blood and fire pour from the fatal wound. Drogon and Rhaegal cry out for their brother, but are powerless to help him as Daenerys watches in horror and sorrow. Viserion crashes onto the frozen lake, shattering the ice, and slowly sinks beneath it.  706 Jon Benjen Benjen saves Jon from death.  As the Night King readies another spear, Jon hollers at Daenerys and company to leave with her remaining dragons before being dragged under the ice by two wights. Daenerys and the survivors of Jon's ranging expedition flee with Drogon and Rhaegal before the Night King can kill them. He hurls the second javelin, but Drogon narrowly dodges it. With the dragons gone, the Night King and his army leave the scene. Later, Jon Snow climbs out of the ice and regains Longclaw. Jon is quickly spotted and pursued by a large horde. Before the wights can finish the King in the North, his long-lost uncle Benjen Stark appears on horseback with his flaming flail. Benjen tells Jon to flee on his horse while he stays behind to buy time for Jon to escape. While riding away on horseback, Jon watches his uncle being overwhelmed by the undead.  At Eastwatch, Sandor carries the struggling Wight into a boat. Tormund and Beric tell him they will meet again but Sandor retorts he hopes not. Daenerys sends Drogon and Rhaegal to scour the surrounding mountains for Jon. Jorah tells Daenerys that it is time to leave but she insists on waiting a bit longer. Before she can leave, they hear a horn blowing signaling a rider approaching. Looking down from the battlements, Dany sees a wounded Jon Snow approaching on horseback. Aboard their ship, Davos and Gendry remove the frozen-stiff garments and tend to Jon Snow, who has suffered severe hypothermia and several minor injuries. Daenerys also notes the massive scars on his chest from his previous fatal wounds.  In the Narrow Sea, Jon Snow wakes to find Daenerys watching over him in his chambers. Jon apologizes for the disastrous ranging party and the fact it caused Viserion's death, but Daenerys tells him not to apologize because she now knows that the army of the dead is real. Overcome with emotion, she tells Jon that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, and vows that she and Jon will together destroy the Night King. Jon thanks her for her support, addressing her as \"Dany\", and Daenerys realizes that the last person to address her by that name was her older brother Viserys Targaryen, who Daenerys remembers as not being a good person. Jon apologizes and asks if \"My Queen\" would be more appropriate; realizing he is agreeing to bend the knee, Daenerys asks Jon what the Northern lords loyal to him will make of this. Jon assures her they will come to see her for the good person she is, as he already has. Touched by his statement, Daenerys gently takes Jon's hand in her own for a moment. They gaze into each other's eye for a moment \u2013 a long moment \u2013 but Daenerys suddenly pulls away and tells him to get some rest and leaves him alone.  Later, hundreds of Wights use several large chains to drag Viserion's corpse out of the frozen lake as the Night King and one of his lieutenants watch. When the dragon's corpse is dragged far enough out of the lake, the Night King walks over and places his hand upon Viserion's snout. All is quiet for a moment... and then Viserion's eyes snap open, shining a depthless, icy blue."], "review": ["GAME OF THRONES SEASON 7 EPISODE 6 (BEYOND THE WALL)The party is moving beyond the wall. The members are bonding together. Tormund and Jon have a buddy-buddy chat. Jorah has his Japanese moment: \u201cI brought shame onto my house\u201d after a nice talk with Jon. Tormund and Hound bond too. Also, gingers are kissed by the fire! Yay, my ginger beard! Tormund tells the Hound: \u201cyou are not mean. You have sad eyes.\u201d This is one of the best dialogues in the 7th season. Jon and Beric talk seemingly serious stuff with dramatic voices.All this bonding of characters implies that the show is trying to combine the characters for a common cause. As Beric says \u201cdeath is the enemy.\u201dIn Winterfell, Arya is being impulsive. After discovering Sansa\u2019s letter, she confronts her. Not only is she being unreasonable \u2013 as obviously Sansa was forced to write that letter \u2013 but she is also spreading hate: \u201cI remember your fancy dress, your fancy hair.\u201d This seems to me the continuation of Arya\u2019s childhood hate against Sansa. She didn\u2019t let go of it. We all know that if Arya were in Sansa\u2019s place, she already would have been dead. And that is exactly what Sansa tells Arya.I think the show spoiled the character of Arya. She was a little cute girl whom we liked from the beginning. Now, she is heartless and cold, caring only about killing. I mean, yeah, it was expected that she could turn cold after all the things she has seen but\u2026 isn\u2019t this a little too much?!Tyrion and Daenerys chat. It has been, what, 3rd, 4th allusion of Dany\u2019s dying? It would be interesting to see when Daenerys will die. I doubt it will happen this season as the show is still building the Jon-Dany romance.The bear kills Thoros of Myr. In the meantime, Hound has to man up about the fire-fright.Sansa shares her concerns with Littlefinger \u2013 not sure why. Littlefinger tries to instigate the drama by asking provocative questions to Sansa. Good manipulation tactics, Petyr!A party of wights and a white walker appear. Jon and co. give them bait and kill the white walker. For some reason, all the wights die except for one. As Jon points out \u201cmaybe the white walker was the one who turned the wights.\u201d This is very huge. This might mean that if humans manage to kill the Night\u2019s King they will automatically kill all the wight army. But, boy, that would be bloody difficult.The guys are stranded on a frozen lake. The Night\u2019s King and his army are patiently waiting for the lake to freeze again so they can attack. Of course, the Night\u2019s King could simply kill Jon and others with some spears. It wouldn\u2019t have been particularly difficult for him. To me, the only logical explanation seems that the Night\u2019s King knew Daenerys would come and was waiting for her. This means the Night\u2019s King has visions like Bran. Otherwise, it was a ridiculous and a big plothole.Gendry the Fastest runs to the Eastwatch and sends a raven to Daenerys the Savior who comes to the rescue of the party. Tyrion, once again, hints at Dany\u2019s death: \u201ceverything will be lost if you die.\u201d I can totally see her dying next season.Hound is bored and starts throwing rocks at the wights. The army of the dead realizes that the lake was frozen and the battle begins. All the unknown human characters die, of course, (well, TV shows\u2026) The scene was shot beautifully but could be better. The dragons\u2019 fire was damn cool!Tormund was packed with wights all over him. Nobody managed to bite him, right? Smart scene.Some other TV show stupidity: The Night\u2019s King could simply bow at Drogon, who was far closer to him and was simply parking there, and also kill the company. Why not? Cause we do not need all the characters to die. Smart directors!Props to Daenerys for finally taking action when it\u2019s necessary: I mean, leaving from that bloody place to not have another dragon killed. Seems to me like Daenerys is pretty good at keeping her temper when necessary. I assume she could also keep her temper when killing the Tarlys.Uncle Benjen is the real MVP! Already saved two Stark kids from dying. What did you accomplish in your life?! Anyway, Jon asks Benjen Stark to come with him. Benjen says \u201cthere is no time.\u201d Actually there was time! I am not sure why Benjen stayed behind.In Winterfell, we get the Arya vs Sansa 2.0. Arya seriously frightens Sansa. Once again, the Winterfell arc seems ridiculous to me. What kind of crap is this? Let\u2019s move on.Isn\u2019t this romantic guys? Jon and Dany holding hands, making the show miserable and mainstream\u2026 bad Jon and Dany! Anyway, nothing interesting here, they would probably engage in intercourse next week. In the meantime, Jon decides to, well, \u201cimaginary\u201d bend the knee to Daenerys. I am not sure this was a smart decision. Bending the knee or not, Daenerys will help you already. Becoming her subjugate only complicates things with the Northern lords.Viserion rises from the dead. Good boy! Going to break the wall or something, ain\u2019t you?!SUMMARY:The meeting in the next episode among Jaime, Tyrion and Brienne will be interesting. I don\u2019t expect Cersei to have an alliance with Jon and Dany. She will wait for them to lose their strength, I believe.Remember Sam? He is going back to Winterfell. He and Bran might still come up with something regarding either Jon\u2019s Targaryen blood or how to defeat the White Walkers.Sansa and Arya child-game plotline reminds me of my times, watching Sponge Bob and Tom and Jerry. I don\u2019t expect anything interesting to happen here. Most likely, Bran will interfere and they would kill Littlefinger. With only 9 episodes left to the show\u2019s ending, I doubt they would let Littlefinger on board.And, please, please, please, cut the Dany and Jon romance. It\u2019s sooooo daaaaamn predictable and mainstream, I don\u2019t even feel like I am watching the Game of Thrones anymore. Most likely, one of them is going to die in the next season. The other one would avenge his/her lover.Overall, the episodes in season 7 are shot well \u2013 the battles are cool, the dragons rock! \u2013 but the writing? Meh!", "*THIS ANSWER CONTAINS LEAKED CONTENT FROM THE PENULTIMATE EPISODE OF GAME OF THRONES**IF YOU HAVEN\u2019T SEEN THE LEAKS YET PLEASE DO NOT SCROLL DOWN PAST THIS POINT*Got that?Wow. Another leak. Dammit Spain and Norway! This isn\u2019t even that one HBO hacker\u2019s fault. Are there employees in HBO Espana, HBO Nordic, and Star India working for the hackers? Who knows?But the question isn\u2019t about the mystery of these leaks; it\u2019s the review of the leaked episode. So without further ado, let\u2019s begin.Side note before we begin: Why do I think the Game of Thrones theme sounds more melancholic than usual? It looks like the entire thing has transposed itself into the diminished keys! Even the HBO \u2018aaah\u2019 thing sounds more sad!Beyond the WallWe got the ol\u2019 Fellowship of the Wights, walking just like the actual Fellowship of the Ring in LOTR, but with a snowier setting.Awesome dialogue between Tormund and Gendry. Also, Gendry\u2019s still salty about the Brotherhood selling Gendry off to Melisandre.Jon gets into a conversation with Jorah about his father Jeor Mormont. Jon tries to give Longclaw to Jorah, which shows his awesome character, but of course Jorah refuses. Shame, though, since a small part of me wanted Lyanna Mormont wielding that sword.The Hound does amazing banter with Tormund, as we see why we love these two characters.Side note: Tormund\u2019s still in love with Brienne of Tarth, and his reaction to the Hound\u2019s reference of Brienne cracks me up every time.Beric talks to Jon about the Lord of Light like a Jehovah\u2019s Witness trying to convince me to learn more about God on my doorstep.The mountain like an arrowhead unfortunately isn\u2019t capital-M Mountain (Gregor Clegane), but they reach the actual mountain and so the Fellowship camps there.Anyways, a full-on blizzard is now in effect. I\u2019m not sure if it happened all of a sudden as time in Season 7 is really tricky.WIGHT POLAR BEAR ATTACK! Closest thing we come to a jumpscare in Game of Thrones (sorry, Jorah\u2019s arm). This entire scene could fit in a horror movie and I would still be fine. Visibility\u2019s pretty much zero now.The polar bear goes for it again (warning: very loud roars) and numerous redshirts die. Luckily Beric takes care of it with his flaming sword, which would prove useful.Side note: Sandor\u2019s still a bit scared of fire.It looks like Thoros of Myr is wounded after that polar bear fight, and Beric thinks Thoros will die from the wound.Anyways, the Fellowship continue on, unfazed by the polar bear attack, and Thoros still joins them despite the wound in his chest. That man\u2019s courage is higher than the Wall. Also, the blizzard clears, because plot.Jon and Tormund meanwhile spy on a group of wights, and the Fellowship begin to attack them, surprising a White Walker who\u2019s just chilling by a river. Jon then kills that White Walker because he\u2019s a badass.As the Fellowship deal with the last of the wights, Jon hears an ominous sound, and is terrified. However, they got their wight, and Jon tells the Fellowship to skedaddle.Their luck leaves them and they are stuck in a frozen lake which begins to crack, while the wights are getting closer, scary as ever.My god, this is ominous. The Fellowship\u2019s running through the frozen lake, and holy smokes, the wights are almost right behind them. Suspense builds. Random redshirt dies.Of course, lake ex machina takes hold, and the wights fall into the lake, which was crumbling from the weight of the Fellowship\u2019s boot. The Fellowship themselves are on an island around the lake, SURROUNDED BY WIGHTS (they aren\u2019t stupid, you know).As night falls, suspense builds even more due to a lack of a soundtrack and the look of unease among Jon and the Fellowship.Gendry (at least I think it\u2019s Gendry, the darkness plus frostbite makes it hard to tell) though reaches Eastwatch and tells its brothers to send a raven south.All of a sudden, it\u2019s day again, and Thoros has died of his wound with the polar bear. Beric burns his body with his sword.Jorah then realizes that when Jon killed that White Walker earlier in the episode, all the wights whom the White Walker turned it fell with it. This could be very important in the episodes to come.We see an intimidating shot of the Night King and the Four Horsemen, and even with that the Hound still continues his amazing banter. Gotta love the Hound.One lone wight begins to advance among the island, and other wights follow that one wight\u2019s lead. I\u2019m getting Hardhome flashbacks now and my heart is racing.Some awesome Fellowship vs Wight fight scenes! Every single one is badass in this scene, though as we see from an aerial shot, it\u2019s not looking well for the Fellowship.Side note: Why don\u2019t they all rush towards them? The wights look like they\u2019re going one-by-one. Whatever, I still like the fight scenes, but still.Though they hold their own, the Fellowship retreat into the island, as the numbers of the wight starts to overwhelm them. Also, more redshirts die.Of note: Tormund escaping from those wights who want to drag him into the water.Just as all hope is lost, Dany arrives in the scene and initiates Operation Dragon-Ex-Machina, burning the wights. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s taken this White Walker thing seriously.Of course, we can\u2019t expect the Night King to sit back and do nothing while the dragons are there, so he shows the world his awesome javelin skills, and knocks down a dragon. That collective gasp you heard were all the Dany fanboys and fangirls. Viserion (I think?) crashlands into the lake, and presumably dies. Everyone\u2019s shocked, of course, especially Dany.After a few seconds of mourning, Dany is forced to get out as the wights are closing in, leaving Jon as he is dragged under by wights. The Night King does his second javelin attempt, hoping to get a gold medal in the Westerosi Winter Games, but Drogon manages to dodge it.Jon Snow eventually gets out of the lake, and is now alone. He\u2019s in a bad situation, and accepts his fate, but good ol\u2019 Benjen Stark saves him, and sacrifices his life as Jon gets on his horse.Last shot of the episode: Viserion is back from the dead and has become a dragon wight, as he\u2019s pulled by the wights. The Night King comes to Viserion and turns him into the wight. The folks down south should be worried. So worried.WinterfellArya shows Sansa that letter she found last episode, and Sansa really wants Arya not to read it. She reads it anyways just because.Sansa defends herself, but Arya doesn\u2019t believe her. It\u2019s only been what, two episodes, and their relationship is already falling apart. Props to Maisie Williams for showing that emotion.Arya continues cross-examining Sansa, who tries to defuse this situation. I\u2019m with Sansa on this argument, as she was only used as a pawn to write that letter, won the Bastardbowl for Jon, and made the North stable.Arya then threatens to tell Lyanna Mormont about this, to which Sansa is visibly upset. Yeesh, the political drama is interesting.Littlefinger, being Littlefinger, begins to try and influence Sansa to turn from Jon Snow, while Sansa worries about what Arya\u2019s going to do with the letter.Sansa then gets a letter inviting her to King\u2019s Landing, though she refuses as she thinks it\u2019s a trap. I don\u2019t blame her, as last time Sansa was in King\u2019s Landing bad things happened. Brienne then volunteers to go, but warns her of Littlefinger, though Sansa denies her help. Really, Sansa?Side note: Ominous Stark theme is ominous.Sansa\u2019s rummaging around Winterfell when he finds Arya\u2019s bag, and discovers her disguises. She\u2019s horrified, and is even more horrified when she gets caught by Arya red-handed.Arya then talks about her Faceless Men training to Sansa, and says that she\u2019ll play a game with Sansa. It\u2019s kinda like Two Truths and a Lie (you have to make the lie sound convincing) but it\u2019s done with questions instead. Sansa, of course, doesn\u2019t want to play. Arya then talks about the faces which enable her to be someone else.Okay, now Arya\u2019s taking that dagger, and Sansa\u2019s now really really internally scared as she paces towards her. She\u2019s relieved when Arya decides to give the dagger to Sansa, though she\u2019s still pretty horrified.DragonstoneDany talks about Drogo, Jorah, Daario, and Jon Snow, and Tyrion points out they all like her. Dany also says Tyrion isn\u2019t a hero, though that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.I\u2019m glad Dany is listening to Tyrion again after her outburst against him at S7E4. They are talking about the negotiations with Cersei, and Tyrion points out that Dany shouldn\u2019t be impulsive. It\u2019s good that Tyrion\u2019s influence prevents Dany from becoming full-Aerys.Tyrion then brings out a brilliant piece of advice to think from your enemy\u2019s point of view to see what their intentions are. He also suggests democracy (examples he brings up is the Kingsmoot in the Iron Islands and the Night\u2019s Watch) though Dany\u2019s preferring to wait for after she wears the crown.Dany gets into a white winter outfit (side note: not a fan), and decides to help Jon, though Tyrion tries to convince her otherwise, as her chances of dying skyrocket. It fails. Dany goes onto Drogon, and her other two dragons Viserion and Rhaegal (FINALLY WE SEE THEM) join her.A bit later, after all the kerfuffle beyond the wall, Jon Snow wakes up on the Targaryen ship to find Dany watching over him, still turned-on. She\u2019s changed to Outfit #3.Anyways, Jon\u2019s feeling deep regret over what happened to Viserion, but Dany assures him it\u2019s okay, and tells him she is now fully committed to stopping the White Walkers. She\u2019s finally not telling him to bend the knee anymore, which is great, and finally respects Jon as King in the North.EastwatchThe Hound says goodbye to the Brotherhood, and Beric says they will meet again, as Dany and Jorah is on top of the Wall silently mourning Viserion (and presumably Jon Snow as well). They then see a lone horse.Turns out Jon\u2019s back at the south side of the Wall, and he is treated aboard a Targaryen ship by Davos Seaworth.When he\u2019s healed, he gets a visit from Dany, who sees first-hand the scars that Jon had when he got stabbed by Alliser \u201cBackstabber\u201d Thorne and \u201cFuckin\u2019\u201d Olly. Dany, of course, is silently turned-on.This episode continues the tradition of penultimate episodes in Game of Thrones being amazing. The battle scene at the lake is particularly noted, and it kept my heart racing and my hairs high. The politics up in Winterfell is also beginning to take shape, and Maisie Williams makes Arya Stark look so flipping terrifying. The only problem I have is that the writers are placating the Jonerys shippers by, well, shipping them. But I\u2019m glad to see Dany\u2019s finally taking the White Walkers seriously.", "A number game first. S7E6. 7go,but only 6 return.Some observations and predictions from this episode1.The journey begins.The Longclaw is offered back to house Mormont and refused. Also,the sword doesn\u2019t drown even when Jon himself does, later in this episode. Therefore,it seems to me, the sword has some major part to play in S8, other than killing WW. Or maybe, it\u2019s symbolic. Jorah relinquishes his position of being the show\u2019s suitor for Dany. In favor of Jon. Tormund convinces Jon bending the knee saves a lot of lives at times.The ragtag bunch glib around and give each other a hard time.2.Arya brings up the scroll with Sansa. Of course, the sisters don\u2019t get along very well and they haven\u2019t settled their childhood differences. But we are reminded of something significant for the future. As long as that scroll exists, chances of Sansa remaining the lady of Winterfell are slim.Just like her direwolf. It survived the death of its wolf-mother, but couldn\u2019t survive the title of \u2018lady\u2019 for much long. There\u2019s a smoking gun here fellows, and I am sure the writers would love to use it.3.The Hound and Tormund have the best-written conversation of this season. Expect the Hound to be scathing, and Tormund to beam in the face of insults. Although, Tormund doesn\u2019t beam, he LOLs. Or guffaws, whatever.Both have a common topic-Brienne of Tarth. One has lost a fight to her, the other has lost his heart to her.But however mindless you think Tormund is,this is PR 101. When on a perilous path,its good to make acquaintance with a few strangers.Often it can save your skin.Meanwhile, Beric educates Jon about the will of Lord of Light. To fight for those who can\u2019t hep themselves, and keep fighting the only enemy-death. Even when the inevitability catches up. That would be enough for a life\u2019s motive. Good proselytizing. He also observes how Jon doesn\u2019t look like Ned.( Although Jon has tried his level best to look like Ned.) GoT keeps harping on the same note every episode.4.Dany and Jon\u2019s chemistry is out in the open for the first time. When our favourite dwarf finds an opportune moment to catch Dany at her words. Dany refuses, but does the worst rationalising in the history of Westeros. And, stumbles further.Hook, line, sinker. Good to see Tyrion getting some meaningful lines at the least , if not meaningful results. But then he brings up the thorny topic of Dany\u2019s succession and the Dragon queen is pissed. The show has already started to foreshadow Dany\u2019s death, and her successor(Dany\u2019s child with Jon perhaps?) Maybe this will conduce the queen to take a new lover.5. The bear charges and rips apart Thoros. Thoros isn\u2019t a big fighter, although he has got one of those flaming swords(medieval Star wars saber anyone?) The Hound stands by watching as he can\u2019t come close to a fire. Something tells me, he will have to overcome this fear next season when he (hopefully) finally redeems himself. During Cleaganbowl. Also it's no cheap CGI,so we can expect a number of wight teddies next season.This was probably a sensitizing dose,so that we are not surprised later.6. We get to understand why LF lead Arya to that letter in the first place. A. He is the ultimate fan of chaos. Two Starks fighting at Winterfell is chaos. B. It puts him in a position to side with Sansa and take out Arya without getting on Sansa\u2019s bad side. C. To get Sansa to share her inner thoughts with him, which he hasn\u2019t been privy to in a long time. D. To remind Sansa that Brienne is no longer Sansa\u2019s personal guard. If any harm were to befall Arya, Brienne would rise up in arms.7. In Loot Train, Bronn hears the enemy before Jaime. Here, Tormund hears them before Jon. GoT has got to disperse credits uniformly. They find one deadbeat wight, but can\u2019t stop it from screaming \u2018mayday, mayday\u2019. The SoS is heard and more wights turn up. Gendry is dispatched to Eastwatch because he\u2019s the fastest. Don\u2019t know how Jon knows that.They didn\u2019t have a race before the quest, did they? Anyway the wights encircle them on thin ice but cannot cross over as the ice layer keeps giving away.Meanwhile Gendry falls down, out of breath, but that happens right in front of Eastwatch draw gate and Davos finds him in no time.Pretty convenient sequences if I may. Thoros dies. Irony is that he saved someone 6 times, but couldn\u2019t resurrect himself.It seems if you hurt one wight, all growl together. Later they conclude if the WW is killed, the wights he had raised from the dead disintegrate on their own. Therefore, if NK is killed, every undead goes back to being dead.8.Sansa gets invited to the meeting at KL. But she can\u2019t go, and decides to send Brienne because A. She is really afraid of Cersei. B. She is really afraid of Arya, and what her little sister might do if left in charge. C. She is really afraid of Brienne, and cannot have her at Winterfell if things turn sour with Arya.She snaps at Brienne. Because A. She needs to vent after the altercation with her sissy and she can only act tough around good people(Jon, Brienne,etc) B. She doesn\u2019t want to let Brienne linger any longer and sense what\u2019s wrong with Sansa.9.Dany risks herself and risks her life to go save the group. After the hatred she was getting for Loot Train, I hope this puts some minds to peace. She might be tough with the shady ones, but when she finds nobility, she can be selfless. She puts on a white dress first time this season.Maybe to show she's finally doing something good,or maybe just because it would be a good camoflauge north of the wall.10. The Hound thinks he can entertain others by fooling around. He messes up, and sends a formal invitation to the wights(one looks inspired from Terminator) to come get them. The irony is he pelts a brainless wight(you see that he is all skeleton, so has no brains at all) and points out that the wight is dumb. The wight probably takes insult and proves to be not so dumb afterall. The fight ensues. The Hound decides to save Tormund so that atleast someone can f*** up Brienne of tarth, if we are being literal :P Right then, Dany swoops in with her dragons-all three of them. The F22 raptors lay waste to many undead with fervent glee. Dany keeps getting back some love she\u2019d lost in episode 4. She offers lift to Jon first. But Jon, being Jon, would like to stay back until others make it.Now, the saddest moment of the season happens. Viserion is struck by NK, and the poor beast dies gushing blood all over the snow. Before it drowns in the lake. And with it, our hearts sink. This scene actually teared me up. Just like Wun Wun\u2019s death last year.GoT has a penchant for hurting us where it hurts the most .However, NK has to be handed spears since he seems to have undead vesrion of gout or undead version of ego. Or else, he could have killed all three. Jon sees that he\u2019s being handed another spear and asks the rescue party to leave. Before being shoved into water by some wights himself. Dany gets the time to take off.NK throws the spear again, but with a rider, a dragon is better at handling itself.Dany seems beside herself with grief,and our hearts go out to her. Even the frozen lake swarming with undead looks like the outline of a dragon, in homage to the fallen beast. That\u2019s why she has been telling all season that the dragons are like her children, and they certainly are the only ones she\u2019ll ever have. But now, the death of one may force her to decide on begetting another child.Jon, being Jon, decides on a bad time to stop playing possum. He gets up to face the wights, who were leaving him alone. Can you believe that? But whenever Jon takes a stand alone, help arrives. Commoners aren't so lucky in GoT.Well, Coldhands stroms in, and rattles a few cages.. skeletons. Jon gets to meet uncle Benjen as he\u2019d wished since season 1. It was what got him trapped and then killed, and this time it saves him. But another Stark dies this season. Can\u2019t remember a season where no Stark had to die.( I have been told, season 2 and 4)On a side note, can a horse run like that on snow? I wonder.11.Dany waits for Jon at East watch.When he returns and is laid to rest she sees him.Both his scars and nudity are revealed to her.12. Sansa check Arya\u2019s room for the scroll. One of the most intriguing mystery of the fine arts of Faceless Men is how they mimic the victim\u2019s voice and height. The writers make Arya say it can be done, but they conveniently(again) leave out the finer details. Arya simply intimidates her elder sister and leaves. I have a feeling she\u2019s enjoying their little meetings much more than her sister.13. In the boat where they will be later found frolicking(in the next episode), Jon opens his eyes and Dany is sitting right by his side. The first thing he talks about is her loss, and not about his own travails. Proud of you, Jonny boy! Very Chivalrous. Dany gets a good look at Jon\u2019s scars, and maybe she realises Northerner\u2019s weren\u2019t having any flights of fancy when it came to Jon taking a dagger in the heart.The loss of her child has made her unequivocal enemy of NK and she pledges Jon her support before Jon offers his fealty to \u2018Dany\u201d. Yes, they are seemingly on first name terms now. This is forbidden romance galloping at full tilt. They hold hands before she leaves his chamber.14. Viserion is chained and raised from the frozen lake.Then NK touches him, and the corpse is reanimated. The dragon opens its blue eyes. In a Stark contrast to Jon touching Drogon last episode.Two very important takeawaysKill the NK alone, and the rest of the undead turn to dust.A dragon needs a rider in the battlefield.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014End of episode\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014", "All right, here it is.Ah, the expositional talking that I predicted in an earlier answer. Still, it is well executed, and I love Sandor shutting down Gendry\u2019s whinging. He would make a great life coach after the war against the Others is won. To me, this beginning cleared up the reason for Beric\u2019s survival in the show, over and above cutting out Lady Stoneheart. The Lady is driven entirely by vengeance, whereas the show is turning Beric into Jon\u2019s How to be a resurrected warrior of R\u2019hllor, guiding him more and more towards the path of the Lord of Light. The conversation between them was the beginning of this. I loved Beric\u2019s quip you take after your mother to Jon. Yes he does, my friend, indeed he does.As predicted, Jon tried to restore the sword of House Mormont to the last living Mormont on the show of fighting age, Ser Jorah. Jorah was unusually generous though, bestowing the blade on Jon and his children, even though technically the right to do belongs to Lady Lyanna Mormont. The conversation between Tormund and Sandor was amazing to watch, as was Sandor\u2019s wait, what moment when he inferred that the lady Tormund was talking about was none other than Brienne of Tarth.There is one other notable theme in all this exposition. It is this. For all the things that Gendry has suffered, he is still very much the wet-behind-the-ears junior partner in this enterprise, and the show makes sure to remind him, and us, of this.And then, the intrigue begins. As predicted, the letter that LF planted on Arya is the same one that Cersei had Sansa write under duress. We know that, but Arya doesn\u2019t, since she\u2019d already murdered a boy by then and gone on the run, her life forfeit if she was caught. and she doesn\u2019t care if Sansa was under duress or not. This might seem unfair to Sansa, but remember, these are old wounds that were never addressed until now. Arya responded to her father\u2019s arrest and the slaughter of their household by going on the run, while Sansa was directly responsible for those two events as a result of her naive panic over not marrying Joffrey, a nerve that Arya does not fail to prick.Arya hated Joffrey, Cersei and the whole lot from the capital right from the instant she was forced to abandon Nymeria to the wild. Sansa was devastated by the loss of Lady, but she considered her direwolf almost purely as a pet (which influenced Lady\u2019s behaviour through the mental link that Sansa never explored), and therefore her death didn\u2019t sour Sansa towards the KL crowd as much as the loss of Nymeria affected Arya.Sansa\u2019s suffering has been more subtle, except for her marriage to Ramsay Snow, while Arya\u2019s journey has been viscerally violent from the moment Syrio Forel told her to run. From the deaths of Yoren and Lommy to working as a servant at Harrenhal to serving as cupbearer to both Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton, I personally don\u2019t think there is any merit to Sansa\u2019s argument that Arya would not have survived the things Sansa did. Sansa suffered those things because she allowed herself to be used as a pawn by literally everyone in KL, while Arya removed herself from the chessboard at the first opportunity.And here once again, we are treated to GRRM\u2019s recreation of Aegon I and his sisters in the form of Jon, Arya and Sansa. Rhaenys and Visenya were diametrically opposite, and Visenya was just as much feared as she was respected, while Rhaenys was loved. Sansa has earned the love of the northerners, and is afraid of losing it, while Arya cares only to preserve their respect and fear of Jon, even at the expense of Sansa. The sisters\u2019s conflicting stances on the consequences of anger vs fear as motivating factors further illustrates their differences. Sansa is a survivor who believes in survival at any cost, while Arya would gladly discount survival over kneeling.The scene with LF is just plain stupidity by Sansa, and it shows that she\u2019s still got that Electra complex going strong for him. Last week, she counseled Bran to be cautious over the gift of a dagger and now she\u2019s consulting that same guy over differences with her sister. The one redeeming feature is that Bran is still absent in all this, and he will come into play big-time in the next episode, where he will reconcile the sisters and cause LF\u2019s downfall and death. Arya giving the dagger to Sansa was the ultimate power move, she\u2019s basically saying that if she wanted to harm Sansa, nothing would stop her. And I\u2019m looking forward to LF soiling himself when Sansa asks him who the Faceless Men are and informs him that Arya is full-fledged member of that society.We are then treated to the continued shoehorning of the Jon-Daenerys romance subplot. Tyrion makes a valid point towards Daenerys making out a succession plan, which Daenerys miscontrues and postpones the matter until she becomes the Queen. I loved how he quietly remonstrated against Daenerys for her unnecessary execution of the Tarlys. His statements about the world Daenerys is trying to build seems increasingly like he\u2019s trying to convince himself. As for my own two cents on the matter, breaking the wheel is officially Make Westeros great again for me, and equally reprehensible.The non-named characters on Jon\u2019s team should have been given red cloaks or something, because there was no way they were going to survive. An undead polar bear, another example of how the showrunners have bested GRRM in creating visual spectacles and set pieces that exceed the author\u2019s narration. All hail Thoros of Myr, a fighting man, who lived as no Priest of R\u2019hllor would want to and died the way every one of them would envy, fighting a creature brought to un-life by the power of the Great Other. I respect the show for not making some big showpiece out of his death, or turning it into an extended chase sequence. They let him live through the injury largely on his feet and let him die peacefully. Well done, I say.Sandor Clegane will never be throwing rocks at anything ever again, I think I can guarantee that. It was a clever line of thought by the Others, and by the writers, to figure out that groups one or two wights could get to the center of the frozen lake where the entire army could not. Also, this siege must have lasted weeks on end, considering the time it would take Gendry, an utter newcomer, to run back to Eastwatch, a raven to be sent to Dragonstone, where Daenerys receives the raven and gets on her way, reaches Eastwatch and gets directions to where Jon is. This weeks-long siege would be an awesome spinoff series on its own.Jon has gotten suspiciously good at killing Others. The one he killed at Hardhome tossed him around like a ragdoll, whereas, this one gets dispatched with a couple strikes and parries, with one feint followed by a standing slash. It was a bit predictable that the wight\u2019s screams alerted the Others to the presence of Jon\u2019s team, and yet for all the buildup, the Night\u2019s King and his honor guard or ruling council that stood with him did not join the battle at all. Had one of them joined the battle, we would have known if there are differences and ranks among Others, with the Night\u2019s King at the top with twelve Others by his side along with many subordinate ranks of their kind, or are they all the same except the Night\u2019s King, who is the alpha.Viserion\u2019s death was not mandatory, but it became necessary because the show didn\u2019t bother to foreshadow ice dragons, and the showrunners want the visual spectacle of the Night\u2019s King fighting the Mother of Dragons and Azor Ahai, with all three riding dragons. Also, D&D want us to be invested in the emotional tragedy of the death of one of Daenerys\u2019s children and his transformation into the mount of the main villain. Daenerys-Drogon and Jon-Rhaegal are set in stone, so poor Viserion drew the short straw. And that short straw, better known as Tyrion of House Lannister, will not be pleased that the dragon he spoke to and freed from fetters died as a result of Daenerys not listening to his counsel, though in the bigger picture she was right to do what she did.Benjen was a narrative loose end that needed to be tied off and the show did a decent enough job of it. Benjen is almost certainly completely dead now, and it\u2019s no accident that he arrived at the exact right time to save Jon. Bran sent his uncle to go sacrifice himself to protect his cousin, which means that Bran is playing a game of chess with the Night\u2019s King across space and time. More disturbingly, did Bran foresee the deaths of Thoros and Viserion, and allow the mission to proceed anyway?Additionally, the scene where Daenerys sees Jon\u2019s scars and realizes that he did take a knife to the heart for his people, who are not just the northerners, but all the living people in Westeros. It probably takes her back to her own rebirth in Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre, and I think she realizes that while her resurrection was metaphorical and he\u2019s touched by fire magic in his own way, perhaps even more directly than she is. This will ease them closer together and lead her to privately suspect that Jon is neither Jon or Snow. The reveal of his identity and his claim superseding her will hit her like a 200-pound sledgehammer, but until then she and Jon will have a honeymoon period while Jon recuperates and they sail to Dragonstone. She may even get pregnant during this time.As for Jon bending the knee to her, it will be invalidated the moment R+L=J is revealed. Jon Snow did bend the knee, but he is neither Jon or Snow, he is Aegon Targaryen, trueborn son and heir of Rhaegar, who was the anointed heir of Aerys II. Daenerys will be forced to admit that his vow of fealty is no longer valid since he now supersedes her in the line of succession, and in the eyes of the law, she is required to swear fealty to him. That will be a major downer to the romantic side of their relationship and the beginning, I hope, of a short but bloody Mad Daenerys storyline.", "I caved and watched the leak with a friend. Anyway, I was all for it, until the ending scene ruined it for me. But I'll break it down first.-ARYA AND SANSA-I truly believe that Arya is staging this to lure Petyr into a false sense of security. It just seems waaaaaaay over the top. Arya not only accuses Sansa of betraying her family (cruel but understandable) she threatens to turn the Northern lords against her and toys with her by saying she will skin off her face! Arya wouldn't do this. Sansa is still her sister and despite their differences, loves her! I am also disappointed in Sansa. While she rightly defended herself, she crawled right back into Littlefinger\u2019s palm. Really!? But I told myself hey, maybe they will surprise me. Maybe Sansa is in on Arya\u2019s plot too, and this is all after they consulted Bran off-screen\u2026.that would be awesome.-TYRION & DANY-This scene struck a cord with me because I was sure that we were seeing some Aerys-Style paranoia from DanyTyrion genuinely wants Dany to succeed but in a way that doesn't harm innocents. He brings up his distaste for the Tarly execution, which she brushes off.Then\u2026.Tyrion mentions the dangers of not having a successor. Dany\u2019s reaction?\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking a lot about my death lately\u2026are you plotting with your brother against me?\u201dI thought, it\u2019s started, the first signs of madness.Then her scene with Jon came out of nowhere.-THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE WHITEWALKER-Jon and Co. have some interesting conversations, including Jorah letting Jon keep Longclaw. Thought it was very moving. The battle with the dead was tense and well done, as expected. Part of me is glad Tormund didn't die, but it seems unrealistic that all the important people survived. I was sure we'd lose Tormund AND Davos this episode.Gendry is sent back to tell the others to send a text message to Daenerys. She ignores Tyrion\u2019s warnings and flies back to save them\u2026JUST in the nick of time. How convenient.In the heat of the battle, poor Viserion is shot down and Jon is left behind. I loved this part because Dany finally lost something close to her, and things did not go as easily as they usually do for her.-GOT THE SOAP OPERA-Jon awakes to a grieving Daenerys, who has seen his scars. Cue the most cheesy, OOC dialogue ever for BOTH characters.While it's nice to see a human moment for Dany, this scene should have been with Jorah. They bonded since Season 1, and while she is not in love with Jorah, she has always shown her vulnerability to him and him alone. You'd think she'd have a moment with him after he just got back from what was a suicidal mission.Nope. She instead opens her heart completely to Jon, a stranger, and lets him call her \u201cDany\u201d. Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the the Breaker of Chains, the Mother of Titles, lets this random guy she just met and rebelled against her rule, call her \u201cDany\u201d.And Jon, who seems to realize out of nowhere that bending the knee was allll his pride talking, pledges fealty to Daenerys as his queen. Thanks for giving the North\u2019s independence to this pyromaniac with a Messiah complex, Jon. Yup, real good leadership there. Let's not even begin to mention that you loved Ygritte, with all your heart, AND STILL REFUSED TO BETRAY THE WATCH.But nope. Now he suddenly feels the need to bend the knee and accept Dany as his queen. Even after she already agreed to fight for the north. But it's okay! Dany is such a sweet special snowflake that every \u201cgood\u201d character realizes the errors of their ways! They all eventually realize that they were being so mean and unfair by not pledging fealty and have a change of heart!\u2026.Ugh.", "When Tormund compares Jon not kneeling to Mance (\u201cHow many of his people died for his pride\u201d) it felt like a foreshadowing of Jon bending the kneeI like how Jon and Jorah bonded over their dads & Longclaw. These two men respect each other and it\u2019s going to make the love triangle all that more unbearable.Does Jorah implying Jon will pass Longclaw to his children mean he believes Jon will have kids with Daenerys? Will Jon awaken the dragon in her or something? The woman said Dany will never have children again, (this comes up later), and this episode reiterated that message. Nothing is ever brought up for nothing.Tormund learning the word \u2018dick\u2019 was so funny. Even funnier when he said he liked it and the Hound said, \u201cI bet you do\u201d.I like how they showed different pairs in the group bonding. Especially Tormund\u2019s \u201cI want to make babies with her (Brienne)\u201d.Tyrion: \u201cI suppose he stares at you longingly because he\u2019s hopeful for a successful military alliance\u201d. I speak this way with my friends when they don\u2019t realize someone has a crush on them.The moment Thoros got mauled by the bear, I knew he was going to die. They wouldn\u2019t go back to the Eastwatch with the group in tact.Can we take a moment and appreciate the costume department. Dany\u2019s new ice/bone-like dress is beautiful.Dany looked so relieved and happy to reach out and help Jon.Which dragon died? Seeing one dragon fly in the sky pulled at my heartstrings so much. Especially when you contrast that with seeing them take off from Dragonstone.If you look carefully, when Jon is submerged beneath the water, you see the wolf\u2019s eyes on Longclaw are closed. The moment his hand reached out to grab the ice, you see the wolf\u2019s eyes open. There\u2019s some connection between Longclaw and Jon.I\u2019m so glad Dany finally saw Jon\u2019s scars. Now she knows Davos wasn\u2019t being \u201cdramatic\u201d.Arya turned the power over to Sansa when she handed Sansa the dagger. I feel like this will come up later when Sansa realizes Little Finger betrayed her father. Hopefully Bran will be able to help in that area.JON CALLS DAENERYS \u201cDANY\u201d. The fact that the first person she thought of was her brother, a man who always looked down on her, is important because Jon will most likely be the exact opposite.That moment where Dany tries to take her hand away and Jon holds on was so intense. Dany stays and keeps looking into his eyes but then something clicks in her like, \u201cDamn I\u2019m a queen, what\u2019s happening between us, we shouldn\u2019t be holding hands like this\u201d, and she withdraws her hand a second time.I\u2019m so excited to see where they go with the wight dragon. We know from this episode that once you kill the lieutenant/king who turned the wights, they all die. So for the final battle, Jon will be going for the Night King himself and a lot of important characters will die trying to help him get there. The wight dragon will definitely cause some trouble before Jon kills the lieutenant/king that turned it.I\u2019m both excited and dreading that final battle.", "Disclaimer: This is just my opinion. Judging by what others have said, it looks like I might get some hate for this answer, but just remember that it's my opinion. Feel free to pose thoughtful arguments in the comments, but just don't get hostile purely over something as trivial as a TV episode.My overall review of the episode was that I thoroughly disliked it. The only episode of this that I believe was subpar was \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\". To begin, let's talk about the intial scene, which is, in my opinion, the highpoint of the episode. We get several very emotional, interesting conversations which reveal details about the characters (Gendry and the BwB, Jorah and Jon), and a bit of comic relief from the Hound and Tormund, a pairing I would definitely like to see more of. However, I am somewhat disappointed of how Gendry's conversation went nowhere. Did he forgive the Brotherhood without Banners? Nonetheless, this scene is a good intro. Unfortunately, things go downhill from here very quickly. Rather than addressing this episode scene-by-scene, I think it would be best to talk about it by location from this point forward. Next up is Winterfell, a section of the episode I am highly ambivalent about. Though the overall plot remains interesting and LittleFinger's manipulation is, as always, a highpoint, the dialogue is incredibly flat and the scenes simply feel out of place given the lack of consequentiality when compared with the other plotlines present. Had we seen some significant development in the story and character arcs here, I would have been much more pleased. However, we instead get a bunch of rushed scenes that don't feel nearly as connected as they should. Arya's reveal of her discovery, Sansa's dismissal of Brienne when she is needed more than ever, and Sansa's discovery of Arya's faces don't seem to string together in a coherent manner. The dialogue following Sansa's discovery is definitely a lowpoint in the episode, and we end up getting little to no resolution to this plotline. Arya appears to be allying with Sansa, though her motivations are never explained, which makes me particular angry.Daenerys is the next non-Wall section of I will talk about. This particular section features far too little plot development and seemingly dismisses the set-up \"Daenerys is going mad and must be stopped\" storyline set up in the previous episode. Every word out of her mouth made me immediately yell \"fuck you!\" at the screen of my desktop, but Tyrion does little to nothing to stop her and there seems to be no strain on their relationship. Tyrion remains her loyal servant, a constant reminder to how the show's most developed character transformed into its least-interesting, most static character. Daenerys does eventually leave, despite all warnings from Tyrion, but again, the buildup is completely let go. Tyrion does not get mad or put his foot down, he simply stares in horror, despite the fact that he had the same reaction last episode. An opportunity to make the episode much better is once again present, with Tyrion harboring a slew of pent-up emotions. An angry confrontation followed by a defiant Daenerys flying away filled with rage would have been a PERFECT inclusion. Perhaps she could banish Tyrion, leading him to head into a spiral towards sociopathy mirroring that in the books eventually resulting in him deciding to take her down along with Varys. But we get none of this, since D&D have no balls. They're afraid to create strife between two likeable characters or give Tyrion a negative arc. Once again, I am very displeased with this segment.Now that we have that out of the way, we get to the Wall bits, filled with plot holes, nonsensical plot developments, and boring, uninspired action. Thoros is mauled by a polar bear wight in a very boring action sequence, yet does not appear to have any significant wounds and can still walk several miles. The gang then takes out a bunch of wights and their leader in a very rushed sequence which is rendered incoherent by the camera's constant, ADHD cuts from one character to another. PICK ONE POV AND STAY WITH IT. I DON'T NEED TO SEE WHAT GENDRY IS DOING, I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE ONLY MAIN CHARACTER HERE FIGHTING THE ONLY WHITE WALKER HERE IS DOING. Anyway, all the wights drop dead after the WW is killed, save one whose prolonged existence is unexplained. After this, we head to an island in the middle of a frozen lake; an interesting idea for a battle, I admit, but one of which little comes. First of all, there is no need to have the wights wait to attack. Why not have them simply charge; what was the point of writing that in? The long period of insipid waiting on the island kills any tension that existed, a situation only worsened by the fact that the characters seem completely unfazed by this development. They're just sitting there. Also, there's something about Gendry running which makes no sense in terms of timeline, because how could he get to the Wall and have a raven fly to Dragonstone so quickly? Anyway, after waiting for a while the Hound throws a rock, which makes a horde of wights charge towards them. This makes absolutely no sense; why would the wights even wait in the first place, since it seems like there was an unbroken patch of ice through which they could have traveled. But it happens nonetheless, of course, because movie, and we then get a very boring, uninspired action sequence. No interesting set is put into place(as in Blackwater), we get no interesting cinematography or scores to aid an otherwise typical battle concept (as in BotB), there is no element of surprise(as in Hardhome), no characters we give half a fuck about die(as in Watchers on the Wall), because D&D have no balls, and there is absolutely no tension whatsoever (as in any other GoT battle). Mundanely shot and conceived hand-to-hand combat, just like that which we have seen thousands of times before, results in a very poor battle, even if the show so desperately wants us to believe that it is an event of monumental proportions. After a few minutes of this, Daenerys arrives on dragon and kills an army of wights and rescues the gang, except for Jon, who stays for no reason whatsoever. Seriously, his motivations are not explained at all. Even though I'm pretty angry at this segment, we do end up getting one very pleasing plot development: the death of Viseron. Granted, it was fairly obvious that they would kill the one dragon named after a distasteful character, and I would much rather it have been Rhaegal or even Drogon, but the possibility of the Night King with a dragon really makes me anticipate the coming season. After this, Benjen comes to rescue Jon, we get a cringy line of dialogue (\"Benjen? How?\"), which should have been replaced by a facial expression conveying shock, and Benjen dies. We're supposed to think the showrunners are willing to kill off characters because of this, but let's all consider how much we cared about Benjen; he got next to no screen time and had very little importance to the overall plot. Fuck you, D&D.Jon ends up arriving at the Wall (How? Wasn't there a giant wight army that had just killed Benjen only a little bit behind him? Did that not pose any issue?) and he makes an alliance with Daenerys, who ends up figuring out about his scars, but nothing comes of it, and they end up talking about her name instead. Cringy dialogue. The Night King resurrects Viserion (gee, I didn't see that coming) and the episode just ends there. Fuck this show.The main problem for me with this episode was that it relies solely on the fact that it contains a big budget battle rather than good writing or plot development. Every GoT battle is effectively just a dick-measuring contest now: which one showcases more CGI or has the most live horses? In the past, the showrunners have gotten away with this, with the battles gradually losing emotional impact and overall tension, but this is teh breaking point. We're given so little change in this episode, so little to give a fuck about, that all the CGI and blood splatters are revealed for the dick measuring contest they are. The worst part is that D&D won't learn from this: if this episode gets enough praise from the fanbase, D&D's gut reaction will just be to make another of these gigantic action sequences next season one which will somehow be forced to top this mess.To conclude, Arya and Sansa's plot is left very unresolved, Daenerys and Tyrion's dynamic remains unchanged, and the Night King is only slightly closer to knocking down the Wall. Even though the episode tries to convince you that it is dark, no one of importance, or even anyone we really care about, dies, there is no tension in the battle scenes, and none of the thoroughly set up negative changes to relationships, which could have an emotional impact on the audience, come to fruition. How much changed, overall? The Wall is still up, everyone is still alive, and no major political or strategic gains have been made by any of the houses warring for the throne. I have similar feelings for the season as a whole, to be honest, and it's staring to look like the only major development in the season will occur at the very end at which point the Wall will likely come tumbling down. The only bright side is that this episode had so little dynamic change that D&D aren't permanently handicapped by its flaws. In the end, I give the episode a 4/10.(Note: I watched this episode with incredibly poor audio and video quality, so I might consider raising the score when I see a better version. Nonetheless, I really can't see myself giving this episode anything above a 5/10.)", "It's this simple people: if you dont want to see spoilers don't read and don't throw your \u201cyou shouldn't be watching it\u201d at anybody who has watched it. If someone tells me that I'm going to direct them to the South Park episode \u201cNot a Big Deal.\u201d I digress\u2026It was a fun episode to watch and it was visually breathtaking. While I am of the ilk that some things in this episode didn't make sense, I will invoke the MST3K Mantra and go forward bearing in mind it's just a TV show. So pressing on:The first 20 minutes of dialogue among the hunting party was pretty good. Some great moments if comic relief. It was nice to see the ranging party talk to each other. I particularly loved the dialogue between the Hound and Tormuns. I also enjoyed Jon trying to give Longclaw back to jorah who in turn implied it belongs to him and his future generation (was he implying it would be with Dany?) While it may feel fan-servicey to have all these badass characters together and talking, I ate it all up.I don't like the Winterfell plot. Not because Arya and Sansa are bickering, but because it feels like there was nothing to do with Littlefinger's character so they just made him try to run a power play in the North. It seems like LF is just sitting around waiting to die.The Dany-Tyrion conversation was interesting. To start, her coy shyness when Tyrion said Jon's in love with Dany. She deflected like anyone else with a crush normally does. Then taking the conversation to Cersei, my least favorite parts of Dany began to show. Some arrogance and entitlement seemed abound. While she's not wrong, I don't think Tyrion is wrong either. She needs to start preparing for the what happens if she wins the throne.I'm sorry but the polar bear was cool.I liked how the tension ratcheted itself up after the first fight with the white walker party. Once they reached the rock in the middle of the lake my heart was racing. But I also loved how the fight didn't break out immediately. That slow breath before the plunge was spot on if you ask me.I'm assuming that Gendry can partake in any decathalon he wants. He can row, he can run, he can swing a hammer. Not bad.Thoros' death was rather touching, but was immediately proceeded by\u2026The most fan-servicey fight. Which was amazing. I concede that the shot for shot action of each of the characters was a little cheesy, but man was it fun to watch.Dany\u2019s arrival felt a little like deus ex Machina but still it was amazing to witness the fight between dragons and the white walker. Did anyone else notice Dany\u2019s smile when she reach for Jon's hand?I know Viserion's deaths was supposed to be sad, but I can't lie I was ready for it. A dragon had to die eventually.Benjen deserved a better bow out.I don't know what to make of the final scene with Dany and Jon. Dany saw Jon's scars so that will be an interesting conversation now that she knows it wasn't a figure of speech. Hand holding and held gazes aside, I found it odd that Dany received Jon's fealty but it almost seemed like she didn't want it. Maybe Dany respects Jon's position at KitN, or maybe she would rather have Jon at her side as King more than as her Warden of the North. Maybe I'm overanalyzing but it seemed the last scene they both wanted to say something but couldn't get it out.The Night King has a new mount and Westeros is now screwed!Great episode. Probably will end up in the top 10-15 episodes consistently. It might have been too fan-servicey for some, but I loved every second of it.", "What is your review of Game of Thrones S7E6? (Beyond the Wall)This is the 33rd answer on this thread and I suppose the spoilers may not really matter. This is what I think of this episode \u201cIt is one of the worst episodes I have seen. There was only ONE chilling moment, which I will mention later\u201d. The rest was trashy.So Jon Snow, after all that independence and \u2018I will not bend the knee\u2019 suddenly decides that Dany (eew) is THE REAL THING? And to set it up they had to have Tormund make a disparaging comment about Mance\u2019s ego not letting him bend the knee resulting in deaths of thousands. In one fell swoop ruining three characters. And why does Jon get this epiphany? Because Dany saves his arse? Which brings me to the next pointThe plot to go and capture a wight is so lame that it befuddles me completely. And for the best individual warriors to go on this mission is worse than stupid. What did they expect would happen? That they would shop for a wight and put it in a cart home? The only thing we learnt that killing a whitewalker destroys the wights that he has created. That is a pointer to how this MAY end - killing the Night\u2019s King could be the answer.I think the show-writers gave a long contract to Aidan Gillen. That must be the only reason for the crap that happened at Winterfell. Sansa suddenly takes advise from the man of whom she had said not long ago \u201cOnly a fool would trust LittleFinger\u201d. She sends away the ONLY person who is absolutely devoted to her on a fool\u2019s mission. Expecting Brienne to represent the North in political discussions in Kings Landing? WTF!!!!! I think it is a move to show LittleFinger\u2019s control over Sansa and to pave the way for Brienne to meet Jamie off a battlefield. Whatever, it sucks.Gendry, the lad who has never been anywhere North, suddenly knows the way in a featureless landscape and can run all the way to Eastwatch by the sea! Pull the other one.Jon, who knows that Valyrian steel kills the White Walkers, offers to give up his sword on the eve of battle! What the f*** were you thinking Jon.Benjen Stark, the perennial deux ex machina. Lived only to save Bran and Jon. SighThen that sick romance between Jon and Daenerys. More than ridiculous and goes against all that character development that has happened over the last six seasons. Flipping soap opera material.I shall stop with that one brilliant moment - the Night\u2019s King has caught up in the arms race :)The whole silly plot after the brilliant build up merely underscores the point that the brilliance of GRR Martin is far far superior to that of the show-writers who are all at sea on the plot front.", "\u201cThe rules are wrong.\u201d Arya Stark from \u201cBeyond the Wall\u201d.\u201cDeath is the enemy.\u201d Beric Dondarrion from \u201cBeyond the Wall.\u201c How many of his people died for his pride?\u201d Tormund from \u201cBeyond the Wall\u201d.I watched the episode last night and this morning (Sunday night and Monday morning). As an episode unto itself, I would give it a six out of ten. Yes, it was cinematically beautiful. The costumes were great. The music worked, as it always does. The scenes of the Army of the Dead were spectacular, and all subsequent fights were equally brilliant. This is where the showrunners shine. I loved watching the cold lands beyond the wall, and I admit my favorite part of the Westeros continent is what lies past the jurisdiction of the monarch\u2014the lands of ice and the shivering sea. Much was very good in the episode, but in terms of the story itself, it left me feeling a bit empty.Arya and Sansa (Lady Macbeth vs. Lady Macbeth) I can believe that Arya has lost much of her humanity by turning into a killing machine. I don\u2019t see that as a product of her Faceless Man training, which was another symptom of a deeper problem: Arya\u2019s PTSD. Arya was present when her father died and whisked into the wild, changing herself into a boy\u2014the first of many \u201cfaces\u201d she needed to don in order to survive. Now she is back at Winterfell as Arya Stark and she doesn\u2019t know who that person is. We see her looking at places outside, remembering her father and her tomboyish ways, as though she is trying to rationalize how she became a deathly killer. I don\u2019t know if the show intends this, but I see an Arya who is falling apart at the seams. She has lost her confidence. She only knows how to kill now, so she is looking at her sister as a possible enemy, courtesy of Littlefinger\u2019s meddling. It is as he knew the confusion Arya would feel, and decided to make her think she is clear headed. Anger does that to people: they think they are rational when they are not.The question here is Sansa: what does she think of Arya\u2019s musings and accusations? Arya tells her of the scroll, and Sansa doesn\u2019t deny it, but tries to explain it. A more grounded Arya would accept her explanation as reasonable, as Sansa was a prisoner of the Lannisters\u2014the play in Braavos confirmed it, plus Robb was not influenced at all by the letter: he knew she was pressured to write what Cersei wanted, and never faulted Sansa. Has Arya forgotten what it is like to be afraid? Does Arya forget what it means to be a prisoner? That is exactly what she was at Harranhal, with the Hound, and later in her time with the Faceless Man cult. But this Arya cannot hear the suffering in Sansa\u2019s voice: she assumes Sansa betrayed her family because she acted like a girl: she liked nice clothes, knitting and wanted to be with her perfect prince. Arya hated the rules of feminine behavior and rebelled effectively against them once the crisis hit the Starks. Trained by Syrio, she knew the footwork for swordfighting, and later she learned to use her wits to take down adversaries\u2014the Hound really was her best teacher for that. The faceless man cult taught her to be unseen, so she perfected her craft.Arya cannot hear Sansa because she is flashing back to the girl she was before life fell apart. She despised her sister, and the ill will was heartily returned. Sansa was a twit in those days, and she is now the first to admit it. But Arya cannot go beyond her younger days when her sister was her greatest rival. Now she is projecting all her rage about her suffering by making Sansa the cause.I know a lot of people don\u2019t buy this part of the story, but I see why it works. Litterfinger triggered Arya. He used her trauma to help his cause. If I didn\u2019t hate Littlefinger before (he just annoyed me), I certainly do now.So we have to see if Sansa is trapped in the past, or has she moved on. She sends Brienne away, when Littlefinger seemed to suggest that Brienne could help to solve the problem between the two girls she swore to protect. I found that fascinating. Did Sansa do that to protect Brienne from breaking her vow? If she kills Arya, she breaks her vow as she needs to protect both girls. If she displeases Sansa, she could be dismissed and Arya might go with her, effectively breaking the Stark power. Is Sansa thinking like a political player who understands the discipline of realpolitik thinking? Does she know that Littlefinger has set them both up? Yes, Sansa says unkind things like: I won the Battle of The Bastards, not Jon. I got the Knights of the Vale to come. Yes, it is unpleasant, but it isn\u2019t wrong. Jon admits it. It was one of Sansa\u2019s smartest moves as she played Littlefinger to do her bidding, plus deliberately didn\u2019t tell Jon in the hope that he would forgive her. She knew Jon was too proud to accept any more help, as most of the Northern lords turned their backs on him. So she did win the war for him, and they have made their peace with it.I will predict that Sansa senses Littlefinger\u2019s hand in this quandary. Bran will confirm it. We didn\u2019t see Bran this episode as he may be watching the White Walker fight in his visions. I think both siblings will wake Arya out of her delusions and perhaps make her realize that she is truly home with two loving siblings. Arya may even cry about the past, then feel terrible for distrusting her sister. I expect Littlefinger to exit left or be killed. Really, the story doesn\u2019t need him anymore, and better characters have died because the show decided they were unwelcome, so it would be fan pleasing to kill him, or just let him go so us fans who think all too much about this series will wonder if he will come back in Season 8. I bet this one ends with a cliffhanger concerning Littlefinger.Dragonstone (Break the Wheel) I don\u2019t have much to say as I found it to be an odd scene. Tyrion is trying to do his job as Hand, which is to counsel the Queen. Dany moves from a rational listener to annoyed to downright angry. What did Tyrion do that was so terrible? He told her the truth about her emotions. He didn\u2019t see why both Tarly men had to die, citing Dickon as the one who should have lived. (Interesting: if I were playing the Game of Thrones, I would kill Dickon in front of Randyll\u2019s eyes if I wanted him to bend the knee or suffer.) Daenerys is clearly wrestling with feelings she doesn\u2019t want to have. She laments the mission of Jon Snow, talking about warriors like Drogo and Daario. Tyrion caught the reference, saying these were men she loved. Of course this begs the question, do you love Jon Snow? Is this why you are doing this asinine mission? No, yes, no\u2014leave me alone- is perhaps what Daenerys wants to say as she doesn\u2019t want to love Jon Snow, nor does she want to admit that love influences her political decisions.Tyrion wants her to see how emotions affect her judgment, and she doesn\u2019t want to hear it. He reminds her of her vision of a new world, her choice to \u201cbreak the wheel.\u201d And this is where I got confused, as I am an American and just dealt with a crazy election that still feels ongoing with constant speechifying. What is the vision of Daenerys Targaryen? What wheel does she want to break? Is she calling for a revolution? Does she want to destroy the landed gentry and make House Whatever no long part of the ruling class? Does she want to give the poor rights that they never had? Is she(gasp) a Socialist? Who are the slaves that she wants to free in Westeros? What is her vision? The fact that I really don\u2019t know may not be the show\u2019s fault. It may be their point. Tyrion needs to believe that Daenerys is worth his time because he has lost so much and she is all he has. He wants to believe his life has meaning. So maybe, just maybe, he has created a Daenerys in his own image that she cannot be. It is far easier to tear away existing institutions and social structures than it is to rebuild.The desperation in Tyrion\u2019s voice made me sad for him, but also annoyed in general. Did Dany woo him with promises? Not really, other than \u201cbreak the wheel\u201d and \u201cWesteros is mine\u201d and \u201c my rights\u201d and \u201c I will not have slavery\u201d, etc. However, Daenerys has always been good at getting followers, not through her words, but her deeds (freeing the slaves at Astapor, killing the Khals, riding Drogon). She is spectacular to view, and that is part of her appeal. But I was reminded of Aragorn\u2019s words to Eowyn in the movie version of The Return of the King: \u201cIt is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek.\u201d Daenerys cannot utter those words as she still believes she can give him what he seeks, even though she hasn\u2019t figured out what that is. I expect that will be a problem for both of them.Army of the Dead (Deux ex Machina) This was the best televised part of the episode, but the least satisfying for me in terms of story. We learn a few things about the wights and the White Walkers: once you kill a White Walker, a good portion of wights die. The show wants us to realize that, as this information will be valuable in the war to come. I have to ask: does that include animals as well. I\u2019m sure those of you who know the episode know why I ask.This is the most troubling part of the episode as it is really is well done cinematically, and breathtaking to watch. The sceneary is amazing. The dialogue is among the best I\u2019ve heard all season, such as Gendry\u2019s roasting when he complained about his legitimate feelings of anger at getting sold to Melisandre. The Hound and Tormund got the best lines as usual, but Beric and Thoros were no slackers as Thoros doesn\u2019t see his deeds in the battle as particularly glorious (I was the drunkest), and Beric (the enemy always wins). Jon offers Jorah Longclaw, and he refuses, saying he isn\u2019t worthy and he will honor his father\u2019s wishes. The Hound and Tormund don\u2019t seem to get along, so it was no surprise to me that the Hound saves Tormund (I love Tormund Giantsbane), so the Hound may have won a new friend. I bet they will meet in battle again.However, the premise to go beyond the wall is so dang stupid. They are there to catch a wight to prove to the queens (the one with the dragons and the one f&*&ing her brother) that the threat is real. Of course, they catch him right away, but the battle has only begun. That was amazing staging with the island of ice surrounded by the Army of the Dead. Fantastic. But you also know that they will get out and here are some of my problems:Among Star Trek fans, we have a phrase called \u201cred shirts\u201d. They are the guys sent on a mission with Captain Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy who have no names, no dialogue and exist to be killed by the alien or whatever bad guy the crew faces. I counted 4 red shirts in the episode who died from the wights. Were they eaten alive? (I watch the Walking Dead and I swear it looked like a zombie feast at times.) Who were these guys? It doesn\u2019t matter. They are there to thrill you with the might of the enemy.They almost killed Tormund. Okay, I love that guy and want him to live, but the Game of Thrones of earlier seasons would have killed him to show there is no plot armor in this universe. He survives, and now we know that the show is going to protect certain characters until the last minute.Jon showed very poor judgment. Yeah, I said that. Somehow Gendry makes it back to Davos even though the guy admits he has never seen snow before, so Tormund gives him solid advice on how to beat the cold\u2014he, ah, believes in movement. Of course, Gendry collapses in front of the Wall. Of course, the dragons get there in nanoseconds and of course the dragons kick major ass\u2014killing wights by the hundreds if not more. (Deux ex Machina 1) Does Jon make it onto the dragon when everyone else is ready to go? No, he has things to do, so of course he is going to face death again\u2014remember Battle of the Bastards? Of course, he will survive against unbelievable odds, and now we see why Uncle Benjen left the Wall. It was to save Bran and Jon. Yep. Coldhands Benjen is Deux ex Machina 2, and really, he deserved better. So we get a repeat of Jon surviving the Wildlings, and coming back to the Wall, injured, but alive. I don\u2019t need spoilers to call that one. Jon\u2019s need to be the hero may be his undoing.I sensed the Night King was going to off a dragon and his bolt is better than the Scorpion Bolt from the Lannisters. The Night King was impressive: he almost was happy to see these dragons as he knew one would be his. I bet he could have killed all 3 if he wanted, but this is the show, so he needs one to make into\u2014you got it\u2014an wight dragon that breathes ice. I bet that will be his new ride.Edit: I just read an answer about the Night King by Kelsey L. Hayes : I agree: I think the Night King expected the dragons, deliberately chose Viserion and possibly rigged the entire situation to get his dragon. Hyperlinks to her answer are forthcoming.I won\u2019t say much about the boat business except that the romance is going to happen, and Jon just bent the knee, which may become moot, once Dany finds out he is her, ah, nephew, with a better claim to the throne than she has. How will the North feel about submitting to a Targaryen, particularly the daughter of the Mad King who killed Rickard Stark and his heir, Brandon Stark? Will the show have Jon and Dany versus the Night King with Jon mounting Rhaegal? I will say yes. I don\u2019t think we will see that in the books, but it doesn\u2019t really matter right now. The show got their ice dragon and the line has been drawn. The wight business was not done for Cersei who will not give a toss about the White Walkers. It was done so that the showrunners could end the story. It was a decent episode, and exciting to watch, but the story is just not very believable. And yes, I know this is fantasy, but fantasy works when we can relate it to our lives. With that in mind, only the Stark situation and Tyrion\u2019s reaction felt genuine to me. The rest was good television.", "It was, sadly, pretty bad.Visually there was a lot to like, and the awakening of the dead dragon was a great moment, but the writing has simply failed at this point.The Sisters. I\u2019m not sure I believe Petyr is more clever than Arya, especially given that although he might appreciate her water dancing it seems unlikely he appreciates the depth of her training. And I just don\u2019t find the interaction between the sisters convincing or genuine, and the dagger scene left me feeling like there was supposed to be a message but they forgot to deliver it (the dagger in general has been a distraction past due for explanation the entire season).Time and Teleportation. I think everyone is a little irritated with the timeline being so unbelievable.The Dream Team. Well, if we are going to teleport, I guess we should just go all Trek and make the redshirts super obvious. I don\u2019t think we even saw any of their faces - were they just CGI? Forced dialog, the Jorah/Jon sword thing didn\u2019t seem genuine, very predictable, and ultimately disappointing that Thoros was the only \u201creal\u201d person to die. Polar bear kind of pointless, perhaps Thoros (as the group\u2019s healer) was the target of that attack? Would have been a perfect time for Donderrion to die. Jon being left behind - very forced, and did anyone really believe he was going to die? BIG complaint - why no horses? Who would take a time sensitive trip over a long distance with the intent of picking up a bulky package on foot? And with no supplies (not even backpacks)? Has the writing gotten so predictable that even the characters know what is going to happen? Oh, and let\u2019s not take any ravens with us either.The Mission from (a Red) God. Let\u2019s pretend that a wight is really necessary to unite the factions. How did they see this going down, especially without horses? Walk in the general direction with limited scouting ability and hope that rather than running into a giant wight army and MOUNTED Others that you stumble into a small group or single wight (convenient how there was just one that had not been turned by the Other they were with, maybe too convenient), catch him and carry him all the way back on foot. Yeah, that should work. You know what might be really a useful addition to the team? If only Ghost wasn\u2019t stuck in that rowboat\u2026.SOOO Predictable. Every single plot point in this episode was entirely predictable.Ice-On / Ice-Off. We are going to surround these guys and wait for the dragon to arrive because that is our real objective, so it is ok when our wights can\u2019t cross the broken ice and get to the bait, and we won\u2019t use our ability to freeze the lake and let them pass because we want our bait alive and fresh, but then when the lake freezes we will let our troops go ahead and cross and kill the bait. Boy, it sure is a good thing that blonde has impeccable timing, or we would have ruined our own ambush!Benjen \u201cColdhands\u201d Stark. Wasted scene, wasted character, unsatisfying story arc. And how did Jon even make it out of the water to start with?Eeny Meany Miny Mo. Should I spear the leader sitting right in front of me, or try a much harder target flying above. I do have multiple spears, so it would kind of make sense to get the close easy one, which would also cause their mission to fail, then maybe I could get another as it came in to try and help its brother\u2026. or I could just head fake that way and show off my mad javelin skills and throw at the one flying\u2026. (Insert fake tension here) Why couldn\u2019t V have been hit diving in to take the hit for his \u201cfamily\u201d? Would have made more sense, been more plausible, and allowed a more tragic aspect to his fate. I know, I know - if we don\u2019t kill the one that might fall in the water, what are we going to do with all these big chains that we carried all the way south (is that why their army has been moving so slow?)?I hate to ask GRRM to do ANYTHING other than finish the WoW, but maybe he could spare just a week and help D&D remember what writing looks like?", "The dialogue among the members of the Suicide Squad was great.Everything else? They sucked.What the hell are they trying to do with Sansa and Arya? I\u2019m trying to think of how the writers may be pulling one on us because I just can\u2019t accept that after all this time, Sansa and Arya are still being played by Littlefinger. Arya\u2019s training as a Faceless Man would be useless if she isn\u2019t onto LF\u2019s scheme. Sansa\u2019s training as a Lady would also be useless if she\u2019s still trusting LF. And where the hell is Bran to at least clarify things between his sisters? They introduce him as this all-knowing, all-seeing demigod, and yet he\u2019s conveniently out of the picture when Arya and Sansa discuss what happened to them in King\u2019s Landing? Everything about this whole Sansa vs Arya thing goes against what I was expecting about the Starks this season- that they would band together and, as cliche as it may sound, defeat all those who did their family wrong. What was the point of including Sansa\u2019s comment, \u201cWhen the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives\u201d in the trailer for season 6 if they\u2019re gonna squabble between the two of them just like they did in season 1?And that whole island on ice thing was just so. fucking. contrived. Once they got themselves trapped there, surrounded by the wights, it could ONLY GO ONE DIRECTION- that Daenerys saves their asses on dragonback. I\u2019ve already ignored the obvious time and distance inconsistencies they\u2019ve introduced, but this one just really takes the cake of being predictable AF besides already being very stupid. How can Gendry run back to Eastwatch when it\u2019s his first time to be north of the Wall? When was is it established that he\u2019s the fastest? What was the point of disarming him? How were they able to survive the night without freezing to death? If the Night King was an Olympian javelin thrower, why didn\u2019t he just kill the Suicide Squad who would have been easy pickings since they were stationary? Why the fuck did Dany not identify who the leaders are and fire on them? WHERE THE HELL DID THEY GET THOSE BIG-ASS CHAINS, AND HOW DID THE WIGHTS DIVE WHEN IT\u2019S BEEN ESTABLISHED THEY CAN\u2019T GO IN WATER?Other details that pissed me off include the whole in-your-face repetition that Jon doesn\u2019t look like Ned and must\u2019ve taken after his mom- YES THEY\u2019RE FORESHADOWING THE REVEAL OF JON\u2019S REAL PARENTAGE. We get that. Also, it pisses me to no end that they keep on instigating that it\u2019s Jon who \u2018loves\u2019 Dany- uh, nope, he doesn\u2019t look like it and in fact it\u2019s Daenerys who has fallen in love with him. AND. OH MY GOD. That whole thing about Tormund repeating the pride thing being the only reason which kept Mance/ Jon from bending the knee is also so freaking obvious- and JON DID BEND THE KNEE! Why?! Daenerys already believed him and just said that she\u2019d support the North in the war against the White Walkers, and they still made Jon bend the knee. What is the point?! Female power? Gahh.Finally, the show-runners, for all their foreshadowing about Jon\u2019s real identity, missed the glorious chance of having Rhaegal stay behind and be the one to save Jon\u2019s ass. Rhaegal, the dragon named for Rhaegar, Jon\u2019s father. Instead, they chose to give like a five-second deus ex machina 2.0 screen time to Benjen Stark and HAVE HIM KILLED RIGHT AFTER. What.I have accepted that the quality of the show would decline because David Benioff and DB Weiss have run out of original GRRM material to adapt, and I\u2019ve seen what they could do when they do their own take on an arc (that whole Dorne stuff sucked balls). But the stupidity of the whole Sansa vs Arya arc and the predictability of the rescue mission is hard to swallow. Right now I really wish GRRM would come out with book 6 because I desperately want my good story back.", "Major Spoilers for Season 7 Episode 6:Game of Thrones is back to firing on all cylinders. Great, character building dialogue, fantastic acting, moral conundrums and kick-ass battle scenes that manage to top most other scenes in the series \u2014 a tall order.First of all I enjoyed all the scenes: other than the battle scenes, this was very much an episode made up of two-person scenes: the kind of two person scenes that Game of Thrones used to excel in: remember the Cersei/Robert scenes of season 1 or the Arya/Tywin scenes or Tyrion/Cersei scenes of Season 2? Quality dialogue that deepens and enriches the characters and manages to advance the plot at the same time. It\u2019s great to see the disparate members of Jon Snow\u2019s Fellowship of the Abduction, heading north to pick up a spare wight, talking together: these colorful, memorable characters \u2014 especially Tormund and the Hound\u2014 together makes for a gold mine of entertaining and genuinely funny dialogue.And the scenery \u2014 shot in Iceland I presume \u2014 is just gorgeously shot.But it\u2019s not just the quester\u2019s interaction: it\u2019s also Tyrion and Dany \u2014 genuinely playing out through dialogue the same debates on the moral choices that Daenerys has made that has ignited the fandom. You do get the sense that Tyrion\u2019s points are taken; Dany is growing and learning, even as she stands her ground and rightly calls Tyrion out for the flaws in his stewardship.It presents her conundrum perfectly: how do you conquer a kingdom without horrible bloodshed? And how do you plan for the time afterwards \u2014 when you\u2019ve pledged to revolutionize society? Tyrion argues for Democracy. Is that where it\u2019s headed? I can\u2019t think that a society as medieval as Game of Throne is not quite ready for that big step.And Arya and Sansa\u2019s (and Sansa - Littlefinger and Sansa - Brienne) scenes also resonated with me. Last week I was sort of annoyed at Arya\u2019s political thickness; but this week I realized that it really is true to their characters: they don\u2019t get along. They are fundamentally different. They grew up fighting and it\u2019s actually utterly plausible that the extremist Arya, put through fire and hell would react so negatively to Sansa, whose own experiences have wrought her into what she is. The politician and the assassin: they can work together, but can they really like each other? But in the final scene, when Arya gives the hilt back to Sansa after what was clearly and obviously a very strong threat means that Arya is giving Sansa a chance: the ball is in her court. Maybe Sansa can order a hit on Arya (though seeing how badass she was in episode 3, I\u2019d think twice about it); but will she? I don\u2019t think she will. I think this is the source of Sansa\u2019s conundrum. But Sansa, knowing that the Northerners can\u2019t be trusted (bloody weathervanes) is going to do the politically most astute move: and that is make alliance with her sister. When Littlefinger tells he doesn\u2019t know where Arya found the raven-message, we know he is lying. When Sansa finds out, I still think Littlefinger is doomed. I will be shocked if turns out otherwise: with either Sansa or Arya dying. This is Game of Thrones and shocking things do happen: but I doubt if that is going to happen.Of course Dany and Jon get a little closer together: their chemistry is referenced in the Dany - Tyrion scene and the penultimate scene between the King in the North and the Mother of Dragons is the most nakedly emotional, simple and honest scene \u2014 without the usual juvenile semi-hipster-ish post-modern cynicism that bugs me so much so often \u2014 that I think the show has ever done. And I bought it. I totally bought it.Of course the Quest was always doomed to get into trouble \u2014 I still think the plan was utterly stupid \u2014 but what a fantastic set of scenes it was! The Bear felt a bit like expensive filler, but the rest of the various battles wiht the Dead was gripping stuff. And we found out that killing White Walkers kills his own personal minions off, which does a little to level the playing field, I guess. Thoros and the redshirts bit the dust but I am surprised that the rest got off unscathed\u2026Game of Thrones has gotten a bit conventional in not killing off the big names here at the beginning of the endgame, using the usual cliches of faking characters\u2019 death implausibly\u2026but the cliches in this episode were all done so freshly that I didn\u2019t really mind. Even if Jon Snow got his umpteenth fake death/resurrection. Does anybody really think he is not going to last to the end of this series?I must say the dragon-White Walker showdown is something that viewers have been waiting a long time to see: and it delivered in spades. And we see now that Qyburn\u2019s arrows and Bronn\u2019s scorpion bolts were foreshadowing of the Night King\u2019s javelin of ice. But actually, the death of the Viserion and subsequent wightification of going to be a shocker for a lot of casual fans who make up the majority of viewers. The dragons are frighteningly effective against the highly flammable wights and White Walkers \u2014 but no longer can we expect Dany to just waltz north and wipe them out. Which is a bit of a relief: because that, while drawing some cheers from the audience would ultimately be a dramatic let-down in this show whose name was made by not doing the expected.Now, I am a nit-picker and there were some nits that I definitely could pick. Of course the distances are now so absurdly small that even casual viewers like my wife are noticing it. I still think the plot of \"capture the wight!\u201d was the stupidest idea that I have ever heard. Laughably bad idea! But with writing and characterization so good \u2014 and while I enjoy bitching about the show runners, they really rocked this episode: fine writing all around, an enviable accomplishment \u2014 and visual effects so stunning, I really don\u2019t care. I feel like I felt in early seasons: sure it was different from the books but it was still good.Speaking of the books: There are going to be a lot of book series fans, who mistake grey for black, who are going to pissed off about the episode: as a book-obsessed fan, myself, I could probably list 20 things about this episode that actually can not play out this way in the books. Fan service, blah, blah, blah. But it all felt so right to me, in a dramatic sense. Even \u2014 no, especially \u2014 the Jon-Dany scene near the end. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted that: but when I saw it, I realized I did want that. \u00a0That is the way the story is going: the books might be different. But I don\u2019t think they will be so different, insofar as character and their interactions are concerned: Dany is a grey character, not a black villain. A dangerous force, not an evil baddie. Even though I still cling to my hopeful theory that Jon will be forced to kill the dragons and her for the sake of the world: just because I feel that that might be the most tragic and heartbreaking end \u2014 and the one that most echoes the \u201cbittersweet\u201d LOTR-style ending that Martin claims to be aiming for. We\u2019ll see next year. Or perhaps 2019. Hope I\u2019m still around!Even if they are completely different stories though, the showmakers are managing to sell me on their version of the story, implausible, cocked up and silly as it sometimes is. At it\u2019s best it is the human drama that makes or breaks the show. Though the dragons are nice, too.", "Beyond the Wall made me feel like I wasn\u2019t watching Game of Thrones anymore.I remember the days when people were shocked by Ned\u2019s execution. Then the Red Wedding happened and Oberyn lost his duel. Heck, even the main protagonist of the series, Jon, wasn\u2019t safe. It was thrilling to watch each new episode because you never knew what might happen. No one was safe. While the show writers sometimes overdid it and went for cheap shock value, the finale of the last season made me feel hopeful again (Sept of Baelor, with that beautiful piano music).Yet, as I watched Jon and his six companions walk out through the gate of Eastwatch, I wasn\u2019t worried. There was no tension. I had a suspicion that Thoros might die and maybe Beric too, but I was pretty damn sure that everybody else was safe. And it turned out that I was right.The show has become very predictable at this point. Jorah was cured of greyscale (I still don\u2019t know why that entire plot was necessary), so we know that he is safe until the end of season 8 or so. Gendry was recently reintroduced and they keep hammering down (pun intended) that he\u2019s Robert\u2019s bastard, so it seems very likely that he will survive the series, inherit Storm\u2019s End and probably marry either Arya or Sansa. Jon has more plot armor than everyone else combined so we never have to feel worried about him either.I feel like, in the Game of Thrones that I once knew, they wouldn\u2019t have come off so lightly. If we were back in one of the early seasons, then at the very least, some characters would\u2019ve suffered from severe frostbite. Gendry would\u2019ve lost an ear or two and some fingers. Jorah, who everyone expected to have some larger purpose because he just survived greyscale, would die by sacrificing himself so the others can escape. I would also have Jon suffer from some kind of setback, for example by losing Longclaw (and then he could get Heartsbane from Sam, now I really wish this would have happened!).Apart from this lack of any dramatic tension and consequences (Viserion doesn\u2019t count, that was probably the whole reason why the show writers created this capture-a-wight mission to begin with and very predictable), the episode was just so full of plot holes that I was honestly surprised. It\u2019s a fantasy show so there\u2019s a lot I am willing to overlook for the sake of good television, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen this many holes before. Off the top of my head:Gendry has never seen snow before, but somehow he is a better choice to run back to Eastwatch than Tormund? You know, the guy who\u2019s lived in this area his entire life.The NK\u2019s army is so close to Eastwatch that an attack is imminent (Gendry could run that distance), yet Jon & co decide it\u2019s best to leave Eastwatch behind and travel across half the continent to talk to Cersei. Why? She should have no meaningful army left and even if she has, say, 30 thousand men, is that really worth losing the Wall for? At the very least, we should\u2019ve gotten a scene of Jon communicating with Sansa and organizing the defense of the Wall. Make him not look incompetent, for once.Why didn\u2019t they just smash the ice to maintain the moat barrier? They even had Gendry\u2019s hammer with them. Sure, the story demanded that there would be a fight, but this could be solved by having the NK freeze the lake after they smash it.Why did they have Benjen-ex-machina save Jon and where was he all this time? Wouldn\u2019t it make far more sense and be more believable if they had Rhaegal save Jon (and this would further reinforce the point that he is a Targaryen)?Was the wight polar bear really necessary and couldn\u2019t they have given us Ghost instead? Not much of a plothole I admit, but they keep saying it\u2019s either dragons or direwolves when they also spent a lot of CGI budget on other animals or dragon appearances that don\u2019t add much to the plot. If there was ever a moment where Ghost would really come in handy, it would be on this mission.A lot has already been said on this and now even the director of this episode admitted that it was a mistake.[1]But the in-universe timescale makes no sense if Daenerys starts her rescue mission all the way from Dragonstone. That\u2019s at least 2000+ kilometres from Eastwatch (some estimate it at 2500 km), which would take a raven about 2 days. In the interview, the director said that he hopes the \u2018momentum of the show carries over some of that stuff\u2019 and that \u2018we were aware that timing was getting a little hazy\u2019. That sort of stuff is fine when it\u2019s just a teleporting Littlefinger that we\u2019re talking about, but not when the entire plot and rescue scene depends on it. It breaks the immersion. The director also admitted that they meant for Jon & co to spend one night on the island so that means it\u2019s all just a big mess.During the scenes between Arya and Sansa, it is conveniently forgotten that Arya spent some time serving Tywin as his cupbearer (was that also \u2018betraying her family\u2019?) and that this is how Arya witnessed Sansa\u2019s reaction during Ned\u2019s execution scene (and how she remembers it in the books):So, in other words, the entire forced drama between Arya and Sansa over that letter and Sansa\u2019s behavior in King\u2019s Landing makes no sense whatsoever. Everyone in the books who read that letter (Robb, Catelyn, even Bran) didn\u2019t take it seriously and saw it as Cersei\u2019s words, not Sansa\u2019s. Some people are saying Sansa and Arya are faking it all to deceive Littlefinger, but unless he planted microphones all over Winterfell, that would make her threats and game of faces way too excessive. It all just feels like filler to give Sansa and Arya something to do and delay Littlefinger\u2019s inevitable end.Jon offers Longclaw to Jorah even though Lyanna Mormont is the rightful heir, so why did he never offer it to her? And why offer it to Jorah halfway through your expedition when you might need it later to, oh I don\u2019t know, kill a white walker?When that white walker is killed, all the wights drop dead, except for one. Quite convenient.Why didn\u2019t they bring any horses or ravens on their expedition?How did the NK attach those chains to Viserion? Where did he get those chains from, anyway? I guess you could say he got them from Hardhome and knew he might need them due to his greenseer powers, but that\u2019s a lot of handwaving.All in all, a pretty disappointing episode, with little to no dramatic tension and a lot of plotholes and timescale issues that broke the immersion for me. The visuals, costumes and actors are still top-notch but it\u2019s not enough to compensate for the writing.Footnotes[1] \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Director Alan Taylor Breaks Down Timeline in \u2018Beyond the Wall\u2019", "It was enraging. It was awesome to watch, but it had gigantic gaping holes in its story that leaves the viewer with a sense of confusion and dissatisfaction.HumansJon Snow is not impervious to death. Neither is he stupid. In fact, he\u2019s one of the most practical characters on the show. So what was his reasoning to go out with less than 20 men to not only fight off the Night King and his humungous army, but to also capture a wight and bring it back to King\u2019s Landing? Seriously, what was the plan for this suicidal mission? Or is he in the category of \u201cwhat is dead may never die?\u201d ala Harry\u2019s sacrifice keeping everyone safe from Death Eaters\u2019 curses during the final battle in the Great Hall? He kept getting magically saved in that wonderful long take scene in Battle of the Bastards, and he kept getting saved here too. The wights actually looked like they waited to attack him again after he stood watching Viserion fall.Deus ex machina in the form of dragons (warranted, as one had to die) and \u2014 uh Benjen Stark? He had his sling of fire, why didn\u2019t he get up on the horse and go too? He could have killed a maximum of 50, maybe 100 wights? Why sacrifice him?A lot of people seem to be complaining about how GoT has lost its novelty because it isn\u2019t killing primary characters anymore. I disagree here. A story is always about a few core people, so all the sidekicks have sidekicked the bucket and the central ones remain. That\u2019s what they show\u2019s been building for all of past seasons. Which is of course why we knew Jon wasn\u2019t really dead. However, why is Beric Dondarrion still alive? I figured he was needed as a source of fire after Thoros of Myr died, but how and why did he survive the battle? Tormund is needed for the Wildling alliance and Hound is needed for Cleganebowl, but how come only unknown characters and Thoros of Myr killed when there were easily a thousand wights surrounding a paltry 7+ men?What\u2019s Dany wearing? She\u2019s flying at top speed atop a dragon and is beyond the Wall. Not only is it cold there, it is White Walker cold. The show has implied that she might be resistant to fire, but she sure as hell isn\u2019t resistant to cold, is she?Jon was pushed into the water by two wights and we see him \u201cdrowning\u201d with no wights around. How did he come back up without them? Did he fight them off or do the wights not swim? There were hundreds of them in the water already, so if they can swim, they would have swam out. If they could swim, the unfrozen lake would not have been an impediment, they would have all crossed it. The only conclusion I can draw is that wights can\u2019t swim.Dragons and White WalkersThe show has definitely gotten incredible with CGI, but it does seem like every time they bring in dragons, they lose the plot. In the previous episode, Dany burnt the train of loot (great) but also the Tarlys (huh)? But she doesn\u2019t want to be a despot, and her struggle is never addressed quite as well as it was in the first few seasons when she starts using her dragons.Then the White Walkers. Yeah, sure the Night King had a perfect aim, but it\u2019s an effing dragon. Dragon hides are ridiculously strong. Literally the only thing that has pierced a dragon hide in the history of ASOIAF universe is another dragon. It is well established (in the books) that the dragon\u2019s weak spot is its eye. If the NK really had to throw a spear, he should have aimed for the eye and have it bust out through the back of the dragon\u2019s head because when you hit the brain, you bring the beast down. If they didn\u2019t want it to be overtly practical, they should at the least have had him throw several spears so that Viserion finally falls. The more we see White Walkers on screen, the less terrified (and more fascinated) we become. So as we learn more about their magic, the show should be making them more understandable; not suddenly over-magic them with superior javelin abilities.When the NK actually threw the spear, you can see he looks over Drogon who\u2019s sitting on the lake to aim at Viserion. Why? Isn\u2019t a sitting dragon a more effective sitting duck? He could have easily killed Drogon and maybe a Targaryen or two in the process.WightsFirst off, the bear got taken out with a dagger, so dragonglass \u201ckills\u201d wights? How did this just get dropped into the show out of the blue? I went back and realized that Jon had mentioned this to Dany before he started mining, but how did he know? AFAIK, this wasn\u2019t in the books or at the Fist of the First Men, so if someone can point out where dragonglass was used against wights successfully, I\u2019d be very grateful.But wait, there\u2019s more. The wights finally stopped crossing the lake when several rows of them kept falling in. But when the Hound\u2019s rock comes to rest, a wight realizes that he can now cross the lake? So wights can think and make decisions beyond just their remnant memory? That really changes things.Then there are the follow up questions to blue eyed Viserion \u2014 how did the wights pull him out? Can they swim? If they can, they could have just swam across the lake. What\u2019s the deal here? (Several people here are asking where all the chains came from. I think the scene can be passed off as not happening immediately afterward.)Concepts of time and distanceSo far, in the season, it\u2019s been quite understood that things happening in different geographical locations are not happening simultaneously. There\u2019s no way all those ships could have sailed to Dragonstone without Euron spotting them before he reached King\u2019s Landing, so those two things did not happen simultaneously. But Jon managed to reach Eastwatch-by-the-sea, go out with men far from the Wall, then have Gendry run back and send a raven, have the raven fly all the way to Dragonstone, have Dany fly to where Jon was, all in a matter of hours? Who are you kidding? The distance Dany had to cover was the size of Canada!Overall the episode was highly disappointing to me. But yay for undead Viserion.", "Just short takes this week:The use of a redshirt in the battle against the wights was clever. It definitely added to the drama. That said, this effect undermined itself by about the second iteration.Filming battle scenes is hard. Watching one of the extras do his best in the background was adorable.I\u2019m disappointed that Jorah made it out alive. Dude has become a caricature of melodrama. Also, his banter game is terrible. He\u2019s worse at it than Gloomy McGloomyface. Chap needs a noble end, and soon.As I said last week, a spin-off of the Snarky Seven just walking about saying mean things to each other would be A+ television. The Hound and Tormund were a delight.The lads going north without a horse between them is the kind of lazy oversight that\u2019s tanking this season (which I feel is unfortunate given how excellent the filmmaking has been).Speaking of ace visuals, the ice bear going all Revenant on Thoros was a feat of special effects. Ditto for making me care about a dying dragon. This is the kind of niche art that only a handful of production companies can pull off. We are blessed.Is it me, or is Jonno kinda terrible at this whole war business? Seems he consistently rushes in against superior forces without a credible plan, then gets annoyed when someone has to save and/or resurrect him.Also, his salvation came far too soon this time around. Not enough of a time gap for any dramatic effect. I mean, his plot armor was thick enough already. But it seems the only point of that scene was finding a way to kill off Benjen and get Jonno back in the buff.I\u2019m not an expert at this whole party raid business, but I feel like if there\u2019s one guy you want to protect, it\u2019s probably the one who can bring others back from the dead. F-.That scene where Tormund almost bit it would have been spectacular had there been a real chance that he was about to be written off. As I said last week, DB and David just don\u2019t have Martin\u2019s killer instinct. I\u2019m no longer afraid, which isn\u2019t a good thing.Same with the Great Sister Feud of Winterfell. Seeing as there\u2019s zero chance of this ending any other way than one of them cutting Littlefinger with his old dagger, the scene basically became a Black Mirror take on Real Housewives.On a related note, either the writers forgot to rewatch Season One or else the girls are both in on an act:So, let me get this right: Jonno is saved by his ice-uncle (who he\u2019s not actually related to) so that he could live to bang his fire-aunt (who he\u2019s definitely related to)? Don\u2019t know how to feel about that.[EDIT: I\u2019m an idiot. 10 points to Alison Hill for pointing out that Benjen is still his uncle via Lyanna.]Unrelated note, some fans have incredible attention to detail:(To see what OP is referring to, see this GIF. It\u2019s definitely a thing.)While I applaud OP\u2019s level of observational powers, it feels like the show is penalizing viewers for paying attention (whereas Martin rewarded it).In general, the post-show thread on Reddit is probably the most entertaining thing I read all week. The analysis is generally meh, but the snark is on point:As I wrote about in relation to the Season One finale of The OA, TV is entering an interesting age where writers have to strike the finest of balances between being too predictable and too gimmicky. This is a really hard thing, especially when you have a fanbase this big swapping their thoughts on centralized discussion platforms.So, while I\u2019d give this season fairly low marks for giving too much away too early, I feel like I\u2019d have a very different take if I steered clear of said forums. (Someone remind me to avoid the internet during Westworld Season Two.)", "It was shit and I didn\u2019t enjoy it.Before I go on a huge rant, I would like to say that I love Game of Thrones. That is the reason I am typing this right now. I am most critical of the things I love the most so if you\u2019re one of the few who is enjoying season 7, somehow, don\u2019t get on my back for complaining.The lack of tension. I knew Daenerys was going to provide some ex-machina bullshit and save them, and I was right. They run into almost zero problems. Yeah they get stuck on a rock on an ice lake but it\u2019s not like anyone dies. Gendry runs back to Eastwatch without dilemma and sends a raven. What the fuck. Let Gendry get attacked by wights while on his way back and die or something. Then the audience would be like: oh my God, how will they get out of this now. Have Tormund die to let us know that not everyone will survive. And for fuck\u2019s sake don\u2019t just kill all the extras!Tormund and his way out of character dialogue. So Tormund, who is a part of the FREE FOLK, is advising Jon to bend the knee? Not just that but he uses Mance Rayder, who he admires, as an example of someone who let his people die because of pride and not bending the knee. So out of character, it just isn\u2019t logical.Predictability. I already touched on this before in the lack of tension part. Daenerys was always going to save them. Everybody knew it. Viserion\u2019s death was obvious, what wasn\u2019t was that he was gonna die from a paddle pop popsicle (so much for the need of a ballista when you can just throw a spear at them). A dragon was always going to die this season. Oh but wait, a white walker Viserion. Probably the least predictable moment and was still pretty damn predictable. Jon wasn\u2019t gonna die. HBO didn\u2019t have me for a moment. Oh look it\u2019s Benjen! Oh he\u2019s dead. Which brings me to my next point.Benjen Stark. Ummm\u2026. Get on the horse with him maybe? No need to die\u2026 This is just shit writing.The Daenerys and Jon scene. When he called her Dany. When he said some other thing and she said some things. Honestly I stopped watching half way through this scene.Teleporting and light speed travel. I ignore as much teleportation as I can but this is just too much. That raven is faster than light and not to mention Dany\u2019s dragons\u2026 Gendry is very fast across snow especially after seeing it for the first time\u2026Lastly, the amount of plot holes this mission has opened up. I really don\u2019t want to get too into this. A wight can\u2019t pass the wall unless it is \u201cdeactivated\u201d like Jafer and Othor Flowers were in season 1. Benjen can\u2019t go past the wall because he is half a wight. We\u2019ll just ignore the fact they can bring a wight all the way to King\u2019s Landing.That is all the reasons why I disliked this episode.", "Some things went well, some things bad.The good:Dialogue between the magnificent 7 (or whatever we\u2019re calling them). Tormund is a national treasure, Gendry seems like a guy who\u2019s been missing for 3 seasons, and the Hound is all of us.Battle scenes were well done, and shot beautifully. The scene with the frozen lake gives you chills literally and figuratively.Anytime there are dragons, it\u2019s a cool episode.Viserion getting hit with an ice spear was both my favorite moment, and least favorite moment. When his eyes turn to ice, it made it more badass.The bad:I was a staunch defender of the DB team, if you go back and read my other posts. It\u2019s getting to the point where they are harder to defend. I can\u2019t place all the blame on DB\u2019s, as I feel that HBO backed them into a corner with a limited budget and timeline. It makes them have to rush the script/plot in order to keep as many things moving as quickly as possible.Besides the frenetic pacing, the script is simply becoming too predictable. What made GOT better than shows like TWD (among many other reasons) is that it was unpredictable, and that we understood and sympathized with it\u2019s characters.The dragons coming to save the Mag 7 was predictable.How many deux ex machina\u2019s occurred in this episode alone? I counted at least 5\u2026.that\u2019s simply way too many. Find another way to create drama.No one died except Thoros, a bunch of redshirters, and Viserion. In a plot that was basically a suicide mission. Yeah right.Emilia has been amazing this season, but I\u2019m sorry, Kit still feels very wooden, which is why the relationship has been off. The writers could also do a better job of creating tension between the two.The Winterfell plotline with Arya/Sansa simply doesn\u2019t make any sense, not only from an endgoal perspective, but motivational. Everything we know about Arya and Sansa tells us that they shouldn\u2019t be falling for this LF trap. How many times did Sansa tell us that LF isn\u2019t to be trusted? Arya chose Winterfell over her \u201clist\u201d, but all of a sudden family means nothing to her?Even if this turns out to be a ploy by Arya/Sansa, it will still be a wasted storyline, because we know they wouldn\u2019t have behaved like this. Why doesn\u2019t Arya simply tell Sansa where she got the letter? Why doesn\u2019t Sansa put 2x2 together and figure out that LF let her find it?Overall, still the best show on TV, and of course I\u201dll be watching like everyone else. I just feel like the last 2 episodes especially have taken a turn for the more conventional, boring route, rather than the unpredictability that we\u2019ve known to love about this show.", "Hate those people who try to get many upvotes by putting pictures and without saying anything interesting\u2026So here's a short answer for once!This was supposed to be one of the greatest episod of all GoT. It was really weak in terms of scripts, dialogs and acting.First of all, it annoys me to see Jon risking his life going North of the wall. There is already Thormund who knows the place, Jon should have returned to Winterfel. I really don't like the fact that he has to risk his life doing things that others could have done.Then, nobody understands why Dany is letting Cersei the time to build 50 scorpions. Do they think that a supposed mad queen who destroyed a part of King's Landing could be a trusted ally ? Have they suddenly forgotten that everyone in GoT (Starks,, Boltons\u2026) said that Lannisters would never come so far North ?We don't hear a thing about Dany's unsullied army\u2026 They are supposed to be stuck in Casterly Rock with no food nor mobility, are they starving ? What is happening there should be more important to Dany.As other pointed out, it was obvious that Dany would come and that Viserion would die. I hate the fact that GoT is not able to kill at least some characters when our Marvel team is facing an army\u2026 Jorah, Clegane and others should be dead ! Where is the surprising serie that GoT used to be? What is Bran doing ?The worst part is of course Arya\u2026 All of her scenes in Winterfel make no sens. There are bad acting and poorly written dialogs here. I like the fact that she should be manipulated by Littlefinger but they made it look weird. They try to make Arya look dangerous and umpredictable but she just look like a dumb girl who still can't get over her bad relationship with her sister.I enjoyed dialog between Jon and Dondarion about the meaning of there ressurection but the fight with the bear is useless. Surprisingly i liked most of the acting between Jon and Dany :-)Of course there are nice special effects but i wish that they took more time to make characters more rationnal when they make choices.Honestly i liked the fast rythm of the beginning of this season but they are now moving too fast without putting enough well written dialogs ! I wish they could calm down but this is not gonna happen :/", "It's been more than 24 hours since it officially aired so here's my take on Season 7 Episode 6 of Game of Thrones:1. Sansa and Arya\u2019s scenes are special. Look, I know a lot of you seem to think this is just some side-plot, but I like the way Sansa reminds me of Catelyn, and Arya of Ned when it comes to politics and loyalty. They\u2019ve both grown up in a way that complements each other\u2019s style of leadership.Also, as Kelsey L. Hayes noted in one of her answers, Arya vs Sansa = Rhaenys and Visenya. Parallelism is becoming more prevalent this season, it seems.2. Littlefinger is one of my favorite characters, but I think his time is almost up. Chaos is a ladder, and he\u2019s running out of wood fast. Maybe Sansa will stab him with his own dagger or Arya will get to steal his face for future use.3. Benjen's end is lazy writing. Really, can\u2019t he just ride on the back or is there some magic barrier that prevents two riders on one horse beyond the Wall?4. They could've asked one dragon (Rhaegal) to swoop in on Jon. Oh wait, they needed to kill off Uncle Benjen.5. I saw the whole battle as too convenient for the Night King. I would\u2019ve dismissed my suspicion as coincidence until I saw Kelsey\u2019s take on it. Now I believe it myself: The whole trip was a trap. (more on this below)***6. Gendry somehow managed to traverse the whole damn trip back to Eastwatch in time despite being his first time north of the wall AND his first time going back.7. Ravens in GoT sure are damn fast. Seriously, birds don\u2019t fly that fast no matter how much wind they get.8. Tyrion tried to make Dany listen and he did all he could. You can feel it. She ignored him and saved a lot of people at the expense of Viserion.9. I've known the ice dragon would appear soon in the series, given one of GRRM's book covers it. I just hoped it wouldn't be at the expense of one of Dany's dragons. Also, Dany doesn't seem to be all that sad after losing Viserion when engaging Jon. Or maybe I\u2019m just bad at reading faces.The Ice Dragon book by GRRM.10. I'm still not buying JonxDany. It's too cliche for a show like this. I hate how everything just magically falls into place. Sorry, Ygritte is better for Jon. They should've stayed in that cave.11. This episode is probably one of their most expensive in terms of CGI and landscapes. Also, note the number of extras, real people in mocap suits, used. Perhaps the CGI we see is the reason why Ghost has become...a ghost?Edit to add: why did Tormund suddenly didn\u2019t like Mance\u2019s take on \u201cnot kneeling\u201d? I mean, of all people Tormund should know why Mance didn\u2019t kneel and what it meant as a symbol. I felt it was out of place in that mix of great exchange of words.All in all, I didn't like the episode as much as I did the last three. Sure, the dialogue exchange were fun, but it did little to distract the fact that the trip was a bad idea *and* the fact that the show seems to be really veering off from GRRM's style of storytelling.Yes, it's rushed because barely a season is left and yes, the actors' contracts as well as their interest in playing the same characters over and over again are waning. I get all that, but I like to think D&D could at least make the story progress in a way that didn't make it feel predictable and are all literally heading towards the endgame.Speaking of D&D, I think they're producing the episodes with killing characters - ones who won't be critical in the last few episodes - in mind. Now that they've run out of books to base on, their thought process must go like this:\"Okay, how about character X? Did George say he's important in the last book?\"\"No, but he says he's going to be a war hero in a side story that indirectly helps character A and B, and retire somewhere nice and warm.\"\"...So we can kill him next season.\"\"Yup.\"I'm still bitter with the *convenient* Tyrell and Martell extinction. Olenna and Doran deserved better.****Why it was a trap:The Night King had all the materials (suddenly giant chains appear), the dragon died conveniently in a place where burning it would be impossible, the Night King had the right tools for the job (I don\u2019t recall seeing that ice spear before), and it's so convenient that the one wight that didn't disappear in their first meeting gets to be one hell of a screamer.On top of that, the \"lord of light\" sent them to a place where the Night King gets an ice dragon. Seems to me the Lord of Light is the devil himself based on what just happened.Edit 2: I\u2019ve seen this question on my Facebook feed: Why didn\u2019t the Night King aim for Drogon? I can only come up with three possible reasons:It was a show of power and prowess. He knows the people present, so he wants to show them WHY he\u2019s the Night King.He didn\u2019t want them dead. Sure, before he saw how they could escape, he wanted them all dead. Now that he saw they have dragons, perhaps he thought of a way to make use of Dany and her Avengers and letting them live is part of it.It\u2019s a fucking plothole. This episode is riddled with plot holes, and really thick plot armor. It also feels the most rushed (and this season is the most rushed so far).", "The show makers wants to end it once and for all. Otherwise, this whole episode would have lasted for one season.Gendry would have been running for episodes. He did run faster than he rowed.Bear fight would have lasted for one episode.The Season finale would have been Danaerys saving them from the walkers.GOT has always left us speechless with its \"Death factor\u201d. For one must say \"Valar Morghulis\"Remember when Ned Stark was beheaded. The Red Wedding. Jon Snow stabbed to death. For instance, it would have been a different scenario in this episode. Yes, Viserion death was nearly unexpected. But how about Night King firing his spear right into the heart of dragon which Danaerys was flying. What a major twist this would have been. Just a small thought.Just when you think that Starks are back stronger than before. Then you see Arya and Sansa easily influenced by Little Finger and having those heated exchanges. Starks must be clever by now after what they had gone through.One character we know from the beginning that will have a huge impact is Bran. We have been waiting and waiting. Still 8 episodes left. For God's sake, do something Bran. Show is actually going to end.Uncle Benjen makes a special appearance to save Jon and refused to leave with him even though there was enough space for two. Glimpse of Titanic.I have seen websites where they post \u201cuncut version\u201d. Do they really have to? Nudity content has taken a huge fall compared to earlier seasons.Inspite of all these GOT still continues to be the best fantasy show ever made. Never did they make a show with huge budget. I mean there are dragons flying over every single episode.On the whole, this episode will still be one of my favourites even though it had some flaws. There was never a boring conversation or where they had to sit for hours drinking and doing nothing. You couldn't even blink for a second. Such a fast paced screenplay that we had so much little to think. Even their release has been faster than ever before.There are lots of theories floating over Internet like how GOT would end. True GOT fan would never want it to end in a classy war. Hope writers give justice to GOT for what is has been from the beginning - \u201cThe Most unpredictable Show\u201d.", "I would say it was excellent if I was a cheap action fan. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the word \u201ccheap\u201d is not for the budget, it\u2019s for the quality.Where do I start ?Gendry\u2019s running backRavens flying more than 1500 miles in a dayWhy did the undead army wait ? They were able to use chains but not able to cross a fracture on the ice lake ? Even ants can do it.Dany\u2019s new wight slayer outfit.( and hair)Arya, Sansa, Littlefinger triangle.Night King\u2019s not targeting Drogon firstJon\u2019s getting out of the water, like it\u2019s easy to find the hole.Benjen Stark\u2019s coming out of nowhere and sacrificing himself.Jon\u2019s offering his sword to Jorah during a mission when he will most definetly need a Valyrian sword. ( why didn\u2019t he offer it to Lyanna by the way)Beric\u2019s suggestion. \u201c Kill the NK, end the war \u201c Very good Beric. What a brilliant idea.Jon\u2019s cry \u201c pull back \u201c To where Jon ? You are on a rock on a frozen lake surrounded by an undead army. Pull back where ??Where were the wight Giants ?Chains ??Is Night King the only one amongst the walkers who can throw a spear ?Very lazy writing, the producers are rushing to end the show. It\u2019s obvious that they want it to end.I hope GRRM won\u2019t do the same.", "One of the worst episodes of Game of thrones.. The show built some rules for Westeros in seasons 1\u20134. In this episode they went on to break all the rules, because they traded logic for visual effects.The Raven flew from East watch to Dragonstone in a matter of hours (or days???). Was that a Raven or an email? Why couldn't they come up with some logic to bring Danearys to the wall. It would have been much better had Dany come there before gendry reached the wall.. out of love of missing Jon or hiding her love with a story of \"I came to see things with my own eyes\" or to ask the Night King to bend his knees.. everything else would have mad sense than this fastest Raven service.Jon could have flew with Danearys.. In hardhome it all made sense for Jon to stay behind. But why now? Just for building this romance scene between Jon and Danearys they made this super illogical stunt.Beric tells Jon that he doesn't resemble Ned stark. Come on guys you must be kidding. Jon resembles Ned Stark. We are told so from book (season) 1. Now all of a sudden you make someone let this dialogue just to give weightage for R+L=J idea. Every other fan knows that. Had a fan missed the clues the show gave in last episode I bet they would not understand it now. So why would you make such illogical and contradicting dialogues.Oh then Gendry running for the Wall. Seriously? What happened to seasons 1\u20134 where we were shown that wildlings are the best beyond the wall? Why not send some Tormund's men? Why gendry? A summer boy runs in the snow (never forget it is the worst winter Westeros has seen in generations) and easily reaches the wall.Except for the one cool moment of the white Walker bringing down the dragon, the whole episode looked like a crap. White Walker bringing down viserion with one cool spear was the best thing that happened in this whole season.", "***SPOILER ALERT***The episode begins beyond the wall. Jon and his suicide squad want to catch a wight. There are lot of reference to earlier seasons. They are having hilarious talk. The best one is Tormond telling he wants to have babies with Brienne to Hound\u2026hahaJon tries to return back the long claw to Sir Jorah but he claims he is unfit to bear the sword and tells Jon , longclaw belongs to Jon and his children after him.The next scene is at Winterfell. There is conflict between Arya and Sansa. Arya thinks Sansa is betraying Jon and reads the letter from the last episode. There\u2019s a lot of tension.The next major scene is at Dragonstone where Tyrion tells that Jon loves her. There is tension in Dragonstone as well because Tyrion is concerned about the meeting with Cersei. Scene doesn't end well as Tyrion suggests her about the succesion to the throne and she can't give birth.The next scene is beyond the wall. Suicide squad is attacked by a giant bear. Some of them die. Among the major characters, Thoros is injured.Sansa and Petyr have a little talk.Back to beyond the wall. Jon and his team see a little group of wights led by a white walker. Jon kills the white walker and rest die. They capture one of those but the whole army of dead was apparently waiting for them.Jon sends back Gendry to send a raven to Dany for help. They come across the lake and the safety point is at the middle of the lake. Thousands of wights try to attack them but the ice breaks down and the dead fall into it.There is a letter for Sansa from the Kings Landing. Sansa sends Brienne on her behalf. But Brienne wants to protect her and not go south.Dany flies to North with her three dragons. Tyrion doesn\u2019t want her to go north as he thinks she is the most important person. But she goes anyway.Back to north. John and men fight the wights while nights king is watching them. And at the climax Dany comes to help them and takes shit out of those wights with her dragon fire.One of her dragons is taken down. Everyone comes on board except Jon. Night king is ready to throw another spear to kill another one of her those dragon so she flies without Jon.Jon is saved by his uncle Benjen. He returns back to Wall on horse.Dany loses her child and is very sad. She promises Jon that she will destroy the night's king. John has bent the knee not physically but admitted that she is his queen and queen of all those people who follow him. Chemistry between Jon and Dany is a whole new level in this scene.Dead dragon is pulled out of lake and is resurrected like a wight by the night's king.THANKS FOR READING!!!!!", "Ugh, freaking finally.This episode in particular is a great example of how the show has upped the ante in terms of production values and spectacle even as the wheels are sort of coming off the narrative. Everything has looked great the past few seasons, but the story has just kind of lost its oomph as it heads into the homestretch.Specifically, it becomes ever clearer that the showrunners have a set ending that they\u2019re working toward, and while that was always the case, it feels much more shoehorned and much less organic than it had. Whether this will seep into GRRM\u2019s final novels remains to be seen, but it is rather clear in the show, at least.The show has a nice visual opening, sweeping up Aegon I\u2019s Westeros table as it ends beyond the \u201cWall\u201d on the table, before cutting to the Last Hero, er, Jon on the march with Tormund, Gendry, Sandor, Jorah and the redshirts.The banter across the party between the men is nice even though it\u2019s obvious just filler. The \u201chaha gay sex\u201d joke between Tormund and Gendry is pretty eyeroll-worthy.I\u2019m not a fan of Tormund\u2019s reaction to Jon not kneeling to Dany. You\u2019d think Tormund of all people would understand why Mance wouldn\u2019t bend for Stannis (or could at least see that Mance kneeling to Stannis, in hindsight, wouldn\u2019t have helped all that much).The scenery here is gorgeously shot. As I said above, visually, the show is probably unmatched this season. The starkness (no pun intended) and severity of the landscape is stunning.Now it\u2019s Gendry and Thoros and Beric\u2019s turn to play \u201cdialogue roulette.\u201d Sandor gets some good lines in though. Beric\u2019s been killed six times and he\u2019s not bitching about it!Aaaand now it\u2019s Jon and Jorah\u2019s time to bond. It\u2019s a nice exchange between them, especially the parallel of Jeor and Ned being good men who met nasty ends. Jon, as most of us probably expected, offers to give Longclaw back to Jorah. Jorah, equally as expected, says no, and tells Jon to keep it and give it to his children. Jon\u2019s face makes it look like he hasn\u2019t really thought ahead.Interestingly, the immediate cutaway after this exchange about children is to Winterfell, where two other children \u2014 Sansa and Arya \u2014 reminisce. This is a great scene, with Maisie Williams really selling Arya\u2019s self-training at archery and Ned\u2019s quiet but definite support as he clapped for her. It\u2019s a bittersweet anecdote, a rare case where telling and not showing works. (You also know Ned saw Lyanna in Arya there.)Here\u2019s the gut punch, where Arya produces the letter Sansa wrote to Robb when Cersei had her prisoner in the capital. It definitely sounds bad as Arya reads it \u2014 you can see why Arya would interpret it the way she did, even though we know Sansa was under duress and she thought Ned would be spared. Arya not seeing the beheading ends up being critical, as she didn\u2019t see Sansa\u2019s reaction to it, only the preceding scene.Sansa lays on some hard truth \u2014 they have Winterfell back because of her. And here is the Stark sisters\u2019 parallelism: They each survived because they each ended up in the situation they were best equipped to handle. Arya can\u2019t comprehend Sansa\u2019s courtly armor, so to speak, and reads it as betrayal. But Sansa equally can\u2019t comprehend Arya\u2019s training and what she\u2019s been through. They\u2019re talking past each other. Sansa\u2019s right that Cersei would want them to turn against each other.Arya implies that she\u2019s holding the letter over Sansa\u2019s head, and departs. The Rhaenys/Visenya comparisons still look strong to me \u2014 each sister is doing what she thinks is best to support Jon; Sansa\u2019s using more traditional political support, while Arya is lashing out at perceived threats to Jon\u2019s authority, one of which is, in her mind, Sansa. It makes you wonder if the Targaryen sisters ever had private squabbles like this over what was the best thing to do, or if they ever privately distrusted each other on occasion.Back to the world\u2019s shittiest road trip. Tormund and Sandor draw the dialogue short straws. We get a nice \u201ckissed by fire\u201d callback and yet again we get the backstory of Sandor\u2019s burned face. And yet another gay sex joke. Now, an episode highlight, where Sandor realizes that Tormund\u2019s crush is Brienne and we get to see that Tormund really does have a thing for her. \u201cYou do know her.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve met.\u201dBeric\u2019s chat about Jon not looking like his father is nice except \u2026 Jon looks like Ned. That\u2019s the entire point \u2014 he\u2019s all \u201cStark.\u201d I guess it\u2019s a way to keep Jon\u2019s mother hanging around. Jon is not keen on Beric\u2019s evangelism, exactly. The \u201cdeath is the enemy\u201d thing sounds nice until you remember that death is natural and the Others, in their own way, also defeat death, by raising wights.Sandor IDs the arrowhead mountain as the one he saw in the flames. Can we pause here to note that the \u201clord of light,\u201d whatever it actually is, seems to have deliberately led these guys here? That seems important!Tyrion and Dany are just chilling on Dragonstone. (Where the hell is Theon? Has he asked Dany to rescue Yara yet?) Dany tells Tyrion she likes that he isn\u2019t a hero, because heroes run off and get killed. Tyrion tells Dany that the heroes she names are all in love with her. Dany denies that Jon loves her and for the second time we get \u201cJon was looking at Dany\u201d as a tell-don\u2019t-show descriptor. Dany says Jon\u2019s \u201ctoo little\u201d for her and has to sort of backtrack given Tyrion\u2019s dwarfism.We have a Dany-Cersei meeting teed up. Dany says Cersei would want to kill her as if she herself hadn\u2019t been ready to ride off to burn down the Red Keep with Cersei in it if Tyrion and Jon hadn\u2019t talked her out of it.Tyrion takes the chance to try to talk Dany out of her raging id inclinations. Tyrion says fear is all Cersei has and Dany mentions how far Aegon I got on fear. Tyrion says Dany isn\u2019t different from other tyrants if she wants to get by on fear and mass murder.Oooh, Tyrion used the I word. Impulsive! Tyrion tells Dany she loses her temper occasionally, covering his butt with some \u201cgreat leader\u201d ass-kissing after. Smooth! Tyrion finally says that burning the Tarlys was excessive. Dany yet again accuses Tyrion of siding with his family over her. Tyrion, to his credit, stands his ground even if he drops in the usual \u201cI believe in you\u201d caveats.And now we get the succession talk. Both of them have points here: It\u2019s presumptuous to lay out succession when you don\u2019t have the throne, but it\u2019s also unwise to claim a crown without a long-term plan. (Isn\u2019t that, after all, what Cersei is doing?) Dany accuses Tyrion of thinking about her death too much, which \u2026 eesh.This episode in particular is heavy on Dany being unable to have children, which feels like ham-fisted foreshadowing that she\u2019s not actually infertile. I don\u2019t think she is infertile (in the books she\u2019s able to at least get pregnant again, but miscarries). But I\u2019m unsure of where they\u2019re going with this \u2014 I can see \u201cJon and Dany have baby\u201d is a popular guess, but if the final season has the same pacing as this one, there\u2019s almost no way an entire pregnancy span is getting covered in the last season (more so if this season ends with any sort of cliffhanger immediacy; they probably can\u2019t jump ahead too far). I also still expect both Jon and Dany to die before this is over. It\u2019s possible the infertility is more about the succession and how Dany plans for it \u2014 does R+L=J play into it at all, when it\u2019s known \u2014 and not necessarily a pregnancy.Hello, polar bear wight. Goodbye, wildling redshirt. This is a really intense scene, especially the men circling around together with their swords out as the bear picks them off. They\u2019re finally able to put the wight bear down, but not before Thoros has gotten mauled (he\u2019s still alive though and Beric cauterizes the wound with his goddamn flaming sword). And like that, it\u2019s over \u2014 I hope everyone liked it because this scene is probably why we haven\u2019t seen Ghost in a season and a half.Sansa is talking to Littlefinger about the letter not knowing Littlefinger deliberately turned it up to turn Sansa and Arya against each other. This has to end this season, right? Littlefinger can\u2019t keep jerking Sansa around for another full season. And we get the disparity between them again: Sansa is trying to preserve Jon\u2019s army, where Arya is more concerned about Sansa\u2019s loyalty to Jon personally. Littlefinger tells Sansa to get Brienne involved if she thinks Arya is planning to try anything \u2014 or warns Sansa that Brienne would get involved if she thought Arya were in danger.We finally get the infamous Thoros-at-Pyke story that\u2019s come up like twice before. Turns out Thoros was drunk and doesn\u2019t remember it. Now you know!Seriously, does each non-redshirt member of this party have to have a cutaway dialogue scene with every other member?The men stumble onto a wight procession. It\u2019s not that many of them, just a handful, led by one Other. Jon notes that this isn\u2019t the full group. You have to wonder what the hell they\u2019re doing out there and why such a small group is out. Jon and Co. ambush the wights. Jon kills the Other with Longclaw, and almost all the wights around go limp (is this the Other that turned them?). One wight doesn\u2019t go limp and they decide to wight-nap it for their proof, but not before it screams like hell to probably alert all the others.So \u2026 this was totally a trap, right? Bait? Have an Other and a few wights out on a scavenger-type hunt to eventually give away Jon and Co.\u2019s position? Because that\u2019s what it looks like and I cannot think of any other reason for this random-ass Other to be leading a little clutch of wights.Jon sends Gendry back to Eastwatch to get a raven to Dany. Gendry runs back to Eastwatch on foot and somehow makes it back in decent time despite having never seen snow before and only seeing this area literally the one time and never by himself. Sure! (Tormund steals the hammer, lol.)The men run forward and find themselves on a frozen lake that starts to crack underneath them, before the wights start pouring through the pass after them. They risk the ice and run across to an island in the middle of it. Another redshirt bites it but the ice gives and for now the men are safe-ish on the island. There\u2019s an amazing distance shot of a circle of wights gaining on the men and then stopping.The men and their wight-nappee chill out on their icy island all night and somehow don\u2019t freeze to death.In a perfect cliche, Gendry collapses right outside the Eastwatch gate before men come out to collect him and he tells them to send a raven.Real talk: There is no way a raven gets from Eastwatch to Dragonstone for Dany to read and respond to before these guys all die. I know we forgive a lot with teleportation and stuff, but this may be the most ridiculous one yet. They could have had her camped out at Eastwatch waiting for a signal or something, fine. But this is too much even by the show\u2019s more relaxed standards of late.Thoros has finally expired. RIP Thoros. I am still not sure we needed the wight polar bear.Jorah wants to take on the Others directly and Jon says no. Beric says they need to kill the Night King and reminds everyone the lord of light brought him and Jon back. (He also brought them to this godforsaken area of doom!)Sansa\u2019s gotten a letter from down south (not clear if it\u2019s from Tyrion or Cersei, just an invitation to King\u2019s Landing). Sansa sends Brienne south to speak for her. Sansa, not stupidly, says she\u2019s not leaving Winterfell. She gets a bit sassy with Brienne when Brienne tries to talk to her about safety, but Brienne agrees to go finally. Again: The Littlefinger stuff has to wrap up soon. I assume Brienne is going to parley with everyone else and witness the wight-napping.Even dragons need to nap. Dany got the world\u2019s fastest raven and is going to go help. Tyrion tries to talk her out of it, Dany\u2019s not having it, and flies off on Drogon. Rhaegal and Viserion take off after her too. (How did she keep them from showing up at the battle the last time?)Aside: A Dany fan, as they have been wont to do, added a 100% off-topic comment to an answer of mine that had nothing to do with Dany, asking if my \u201cunjustified contempt\u201d for Dany would \u201ccome to an end\u201d since she flew off to help Jon and Co. And, honestly \u2026 no? As far as I\u2019m concerned all of the issues with Dany still remain, even if she did this one thing right (also worth noting that Jon, for now, is still unaware of her worst moments). The episode did also bother to include her continued paranoia regarding Tyrion and her belief that she was right to burn the Tarlys. Everything she\u2019s done and said \u2014 including in this very same episode \u2014 still stands, even if she\u2019s done this particular thing right.Sandor throws a rock and oops the ice is frozen over now. A wight heads out toward them, followed by another, and another, and shit\u2019s about to get real. The men start engaging the wights and it looks pretty hopeless. Tormund in particular has a close call before Sandor of all people saves him. (Not only does everyone have to have dialogue with everyone else, everyone has to save everyone else\u2019s butt once.) They all have to fall back to higher ground and it looks like Tormund, Sandor, Beric, Jon and Jorah are the only ones left alive now (Thoros is dead, Gendry left and I think all the redshirts bit the dust).This is such a visually stunning scene that you almost forget how goddamn terrible the wight-napping idea is. Like, they needed an excuse to get Jon and Co. above the Wall, and Dany and the dragons. So they came up with this wight-napping. It\u2019s still dumb even if it gets the endgame they needed for the sequence.It all looks hopeless as Jon looks around to everyone. The wights are getting close and then boom in come the dragons. I\u2019m not gonna lie: This is supremely cool and shows what dragons can do when they aren\u2019t used to burn prisoners alive. This is, really, why you would want dragons, to burn through all those wights. Drogon lands and the men hop on. Jon, because he\u2019s Jon, lets the others get on first.The Night King gets handed a big damn ice spear that he, cool as a damn cucumber and completely devoid of any sort of emotion or expression, heaves into the air to knock Viserion out of the sky. Dragons burning wights is cool; this is cooler, because it\u2019s so damn abrupt. (Also cool: The way the camera is facing, it looks like the Night King might be aiming for Drogon first, since he\u2019s on the ground and directly in front of the Night King. It\u2019s only when the Night King releases the spear that you can tell for sure that he\u2019s going for Viserion.)RIP Viserion. That must have been a mother of a spear. The dragon sliding into the lake is unexpectedly sad, at least for me \u2014 I am not generally sentimental about dragons. Emilia Clarke does the mile-long stare look that looks vaguely sad.Jon sacrifices himself so the others can fly away. The Night King chucks another spear up at them and misses, and Jorah almost falls off but ends up safe. Jon\u2019s left behind. I think Drogon is sadder about Viserion dying than Dany is.Benjen shows up literally just to save Jon, and holds them off so Jon can ride off on the horse. I know we already knew Benjen was out there somewhere, but \u2026 really? They couldn\u2019t have sped up the Targaryen-wanking fan service and had Rhaegal show up to cart him off? Benjen just happened to be around there but didn\u2019t show up at all before then? It\u2019s just weird.Dany and Jorah are on the lookout at Eastwatch and Jon finally makes it back. He\u2019s in pretty bad shape. On the ship, he\u2019s put into bed and Davos and Co. undress him. Dany sees the scars on his body, and figures out he really was stabbed in the heart.Aside: Jon\u2019s stab wounds look just like they did when he was resurrected, right? There\u2019s no scarring over. It looks like a wound without blood. I know everyone\u2019s fixated on Dany\u2019s possible infertility, but are we sure Jon can have kids? Is he just kind of \u2026 frozen \u2026 now? Can the resurrected dead father children?Sansa finds Arya\u2019s collection of murder faces. Arya catches her and Sansa gets a taste of Arya\u2019s Faceless Men training. Sansa\u2019s legitimately worried about Arya wanting to kill her. They play the game of faces and Sansa\u2019s not really into it. Arya still thinks Sansa\u2019s not loyal to Jon. Arya tells Sansa that neither of them got to be what they wanted to be, but they sort of did, right? Sansa\u2019s a de facto queen in Jon\u2019s absence, and Arya\u2019s more dangerous than probably any knight. Arya tells Sansa she can become her, and \u2026 I\u2019m really not sure what we\u2019re meant to take away here. Is Arya going overboard or is Sansa legitimately hoping Jon doesn\u2019t come back (which seems unlikely?). Arya gives Sansa the Valyrian steel dagger and leaves.Jon wakes up and Dany\u2019s there with him. He apologizes for losing the dragon and \u2026 I think she\u2019s over it? Dany says she\u2019s glad she went so she could see what they were up against. Jon calls her Dany \u2014 which feels heavy-handed, but OK. And Jon swears fealty to her now that she\u2019s done something to actually warrant it. It\u2019s a sweet moment but \u2014 and yeah, I don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m probably biased, blah blah \u2014 it all feels a little too tidy, too early. And we still have R+L=J looming in the background, which, if it\u2019s revealed and it doesn\u2019t affect anything, there\u2019s no point in it. It exists to upend shit.The Night King had a bunch of chains ready to go to haul Viserion\u2019s body out of the frozen lake. Apparently there is a Home Depot north of the Wall. The Night King approaches the dead dragon, turns him into a wight, and that\u2019s all she wrote for this one.Aside: Before watching the episode but knowing what happened, I theorized that the Night King had foreseen what would happen and had essentially laid a trap to get a dragon wight (perhaps he can use Viserion to break through the Wall?). After seeing it, I think this is right \u2014 the Night King picking the harder target first has a sense of destiny to it, the lone Other and its bait wights, the complete lack of surprise or emotion on the Night King\u2019s face (he\u2019s at least shown concern and/or curiosity before, at Hardhome), the random-ass chains at the ready. It\u2019s like he knew this would happen \u2014 which makes the lord of light leading the men to this spot that much more fucked up.Final thoughts: This episode was so visually arresting that you almost forget how limp-dick the story is this time. The plan itself is terrible, they have to rely on dialogue-roulette to kill time before the main fight, we get a polar bear wight that looks nice but doesn\u2019t really \u2026 do anything (Thoros could have been killed another way). The dragons\u2019 arrival was really cool and is probably a taste of what\u2019s to come. I\u2019m also getting bored with Arya and Sansa\u2019s Winterfell intrigue and I\u2019m guessing it gets settled soon and gets settled with both of them ending up on the same side, with Littlefinger caught red-handed and capped. (Presumably both of them have major endgame roles that necessitate them being kept alive/around, and this season\u2019s wheel-spinning is a way to keep both of them on ice, as it were.)", "This isn\u2019t so much a review of Season 7 - Episode 6, more an opinion of Season 7 in general.Bas Leijser has pretty much nailed what is wrong with GoT in his answer but, I\u2019m going to elaborate a little.GoT from the first the episode has always been a series unafraid to shock or remove characters we might have become fond of, even the nasty ones. The Starks, The Tulleys, The Freys, The Boltons, Tywin Lannister, Joffrey, Oberon, Stannis, Hodor \u2013 the list goes on.Series 7 from the very first episode just projected an entirely different vibe. I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on what it was and I said to my wife after watching it a few weeks back, that it felt \u2013 generic. There was a palpable mundaneness to it. It was a decent episode and all six have been decent but, there has been a noticeable shift in the dynamic of what we have come to expect from this series.For instance, Jamie Lannister, who is one of my favourite characters. He charges a dragon which is about to incinerate him only to be miraculously saved by Bronn \u2013 who was actually nowhere near him when he got on the horse or when he got close to the dragon. When he survived, I cannot tell you how pissed off I was because, for me, that was the first time that the series has baulked at making a tough choice. By allowing Jamie to inexplicably survive (and he shouldn\u2019t have done), GoT surrendered to the well-trodden path that destroys the best of TV series. Expectancy!This has now been carried on by other ludicrous events.The runner (Gendry) Jon Snow sends back to Castle Black in order to send a Raven to Daenerys was ridiculous all ways around. The dead were on top of the group as he left, yet he managed to run over what appeared to be a days hike through the snow, and get a raven to Daenerys so she could hop on her dragons to save Jon and his merry band.Let\u2019s not forget she was thousands of miles away. We are talking a week \u2013 at least, for the bird to get to her and her to even get close to Jon. How much more exciting would it have been had the dead overwhelmed Jon and his group once the ice refroze? Alas, the producers bottled it and instead having the courage to kill off a couple more important characters, we lose a couple of nobodies who nobody cares about - and a Dragon.And the Dragons death was telegraphed a mile away. Once it sunk beneath the ice, I said to the wife, \u201cwhat\u2019s going to stop the white Walkers reanimating it and using it?\u201d Lo and behold, the white walkers pulled it out of the ice so they could use it \u2013 with chains that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on HMS Queen Elizabeth. Where they got the chains from in the middle of a barren wasteland, I have no idea. It\u2019s so fucking predictable that I imagine rather than fire, the dragon will now shoot ice.Also, given that Daenerys has flown all that way to save Jon, surely she could have had one of her dragons incinerate the White Walkers for good measure? It\u2019s not as if they were inconspicuous sat on horses with white faces and bright blue eyes on the side of a hill, sticking out like a sore thumb!Surely, it would not be beyond the wit of an intelligent attacker to think, \u201cyou know what, those creepy dudes look important so I\u2019ll take them out\u201d. But no, she has all three dragons blowing fire on the zombies. I get that this would have ended the threat of the White Walkers \u2013 which the whole series has been building to, but by avoiding to do the obvious, it makes the series stupid and insinuates that the viewers must be stupid as well.So yes, I\u2019m annoyed. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still a wonderful series and one which remains unmissable but, I no longer wait for each episode wondering who might not make it because it\u2019s clear that as we near the climax, the producers have gotten cold feet and are now playing it safe.It\u2019s such a shame because Game of Thrones over the last six years has set itself such a high benchmark by being completely unafraid to make tough decisions that for it to get so close to the end and succumb to the formulaic TV approach now, is a damn tragedy.", "Warning\u2026..Spoilers\u2026..Are\u2026\u2026.Coming\u2026\u2026Okay. Well. It was an amazing episode. But I will admit, nothing happened that I didn\u2019t expect.Let\u2019s start with many conversations. They were good, especially between Tormund and the Hound about Brienne of Tarth, Jorah and Jon about Jeor Mormont, and Beric and Jon about coming back to life. It was nice to see them interact and the things they talked about seemed plausible, I like how they are all connected in some way and the show delved into that.Capturing the wight was fun. As was fighting the bear wight which didn\u2019t vote for irony in trying to kill Jorah. Nice to see Gendry live by running as a messenger, it made sense too, no way was he going to plausibly survive the battle to come.And of course the wight can scream and act like a beacon. Of course he can. The surrounding of them on the mound was awesome, as was Beric\u2019s idea that they take out the Night King. I expected him to die in an attempt. Shame it didn\u2019t happen. Though of course it was mission impossible anyway.Then Thoros died. Sad to see the drunk go even if there was not much attachment to him, not so sad to see the unnamed characters die, it was there fault for going on the trip and not being important afterall.Now the big set piece, if you didn\u2019t expect Dragons to fly in and save the day, alongside one of them dying, don\u2019t get into the writing business. A novice could have written that. Yet it didn\u2019t make it any less awesome to actually see it on screen!Okay so everyone can hang on to a dragon while it flies now. Again, I keep thinking about the death of the dragon. It was like a direwolf to me. Again though, completely expected. Oh and Jon rises out of the water of course.Again (and I am using that word top much now), if you did not expect Uncle Benjen to suddenly appear and sacrifice his life so Jon could get away, don\u2019t become a writer. This was not surprising. It was actually a clever spoiler I unfortunately read earlier this year that \u201ca Stark\u201d will die. Clever bastards throwing me off that trail.Dany now knows about the threats beyond the wall, she lost a child because of it. And again, of course that dragon became a wight. An Ice Dragon has been predicted for years now, and the Season 7 posters had unfortunately spoilt this already. And she also knows that Jon literally took a knife to the heart.Their emotional scenes at the end felt completely off and forced. But give credit where it\u2019s due, the writers really want us to feel the connection, and they are trying really hard.I fully expected Beric to die. And now my prediction that he will die in the same way as he does in the books is actually stronger. He will give his life force to resurrect another, now that Thoros is gone the show can get away with this. I vote for the Hound. They are getting on really well now afterall.Now onto Winterfell. Booooo. Winterfell has been terrible this season, Arya has been even worse than that too. Why was no Raven sent to Winterfell at all about the journey beyond the wall. Seriously! A message won\u2019t hurt. Why doesn\u2019t Bran check in with a Raven. Actually, where was Bran! And Sansa, why has she not realised that Littlefinger is causing shit.Anyway, time to wait for the 80? Minute episode finale. I\u2019m sure the wall will fall, setting up the final season as an all out battle.All in all a very enjoyable, tense, emotional, and frightening episode.9.5/10NOTE: I have seen some tw*t completely plagiarizing my review for this episode and I reported it. My words were literally copy and pasted on a different question. Not sure if Quora gets at it automatically. But you should know this is the real copy, this is my voice that can\u2019t be replicated. And that whoever you are, you are an embarrassment to yourself.", "I don\u2019t need to add spoiler tags. If you are reading answers to this question before watching the episode, then really your fault.I watched the episode twice just to absorb everything there was.I will do a mini recap, and then my major takeaways including what I noticed.The episode was \u2018Fellowship of the Ring\u2019 meets a bad copy of \u2018Resident Evil\u2019, then they both meet \u2018Single White Female\u2019.Beyond the WallThe expedition beyond the Wall on foot was pretty nonsensical. I am sure they could have taken a few horses with them. Considering Westeros has shrunk to the size of a miniature suburb, they don\u2019t need to. The conversations were okay. Many have enjoyed it. I didn\u2019t. I kept an open mind. It didn\u2019t entertain me much, though. It was a bit of a filler. Tormund and the Hound were better than the rest. They spot a bear. Bear attacks Jorah. Bear on Bear action! Heh Thoros will meet his end in this episode.They fall upon a mini group of Wights and a Whitewalker. We find out that killing the Whitewalker kills the ones he has turned deus ex machina style. The one Wight remains and they capture him. Mission almost complete. The Wight acts as a beacon to alert its other friends. The gang make Gendry run back to Eastwatch to pass a message along to Dany. Yes, run to Eastwatch.That is how big the Wall must be.This is what has become of Westeros size-wise. I see King\u2019sroad has improved in quality.Davos meets a semi-concious Gendry and they get the ravens off to Dany.The Wights attack a retreating Jon & Co. They take refuge on a mini island in the middle of the lake. The rest of the Wights fall into the icy lake and for the moment Jon & Co are safe. This part is very interesting. The NK and his other Walkers are nearby. They can see the humans. At first, I wondered why the NK wasn\u2019t bringing \u2018winter\u2019 or a blizzard to freeze the lake so the Wights can attack. The NK had hatched a plan though. He had laid a trap to keep Jon and Co till the real cavalry comes. Then he can make his kill. The Hound gets bored and starts tossing rocks which do not break the ice cover on the lake. The Wights being somewhat mindless attack the humans. Fighting carries on for long before Jon realises they are lost. This part reminded me off \u2018Gears of War 3\u2019, \u2018Brothers to the end\u2019 chapter where Dom realises they are a lost cause before he sacrifices himself to save Marcus and the rest.When all seems lost, Dany arrives with her 3 dragons. Jon and Co were on that mini island for one night at best. But sure, ravens can fly to Dragonstone and Dany can fly to the Wall in that time. Dany burns through the Wights and the men are saved. The Wight is placed on Drogon and they are ready to fly.Enter, the Night King. This was easily the best part of the episode and almost the best part of the season apart from everything Jaime Lannister. The Night King throws an ice javelin and takes down Viserios to my cheers and goosebumps. The dragon drowns in the lake and so does Jon, nearly. Dany takes off distraught whilst Jon is saved by Benjen Stark.Back at Eastwatch, Dany anxiously awaits the unlikely return of Jon. He does return. He is taken inside a Targaryen ship and stripped out of his icy cloths. Dany realises that Jon has taken a knife to the heart. Jon wakes up and they have a \u2018heartfelt\u2019 moment. Jon agrees to bend the knee. Dany is ecstatic and in tears.The Wights pull out Viserion from the pond and he is turned into a Wight dragon.DragonstoneTyrion and Dany discuss the issues of war and the meeting with Cersei. The possibility of a trap is discussed. Tyrion goes through another lesson with Dany whilst Dany hits back with \u2018wars always cause bloodshed\u2019. They both have a point. The issue of succession comes up which Dany refuses to address before she receives ravens from the other end of the backyard. She gathers her dragons and flies off to save Jon.WinterfellArya reminisces about Ned. She speaks fondly of him, his reactions to Arya not abiding by Westerosi cultural norms and embracing the warrior within her. She goes on to single out Sansa for not being a part of them often enough. For always playing the \u2018lady\u2019 and leaning more to southern ways. They argue over the letter Sansa had written during her time as a hostage in the RK. Sansa feels concerned if the letter gets out to the lords of the North. She discusses the matter with LF and he advises her to use Brienne against Arya if need be. Sansa receives a message from KL inviting her for a parley. She orders Brienne to go to KL in her stead. Sansa then searches Arya\u2019s room and finds her faces. She is freaked out and Arya walks in on her. Arya describes what the faces are and hands her the Valyrian steel dagger, hilt first.My takeaways & what I noticed.During the opening credits, the sea next to Eastwatch is not frozen. I noticed this in the last episode too. Whereas in the first 4 episodes it was frozen with plenty of conjecture on whether the Whitewalkers could simply walk around the Wall. I am not sure if this is an error or delibrate. But the Stag on top of the RK is still present. And now the seas have unfrozen.The episode began quite slow. The Fellowship of the Wight on foot was a filler. They should really be mounted. The conversations were not as entertaining as many others point them out to be. Tormund and the Hound made it tolerable. However, a few key pieces of information were mentioned,Tormund suggests that many died for Mance\u2019s pride as he wouldn\u2019t \u2018bend the knee\u2019. This is inconsistent. Mance did not bend the knee, for the Wildlings. It was not his pride. He did not bend the knee because he had promised the Wildlings that he wouldn\u2019t kneel to southern lords and kings. He managed to unite the Wildlings because he was not a kneeler. The show is trying hard to convince us that Jon has to \u2018bend the knee\u2019 to Dany so people don\u2019t die.Jorah tells Jon that \u2018his children\u2019 will wield Longclaw as well. This stuns Jon for a moment. Perhaps, Jon is thinking of children for the first time. Legitimate children. Possibly, with Dany. Their romance is almost a sure thing now.Beric and Jon discuss the war against the dead. They agree that they are humans united who fight against death. Jon recites \u2018I am the shield that guards the realms of men\u2019. This is a reference to the Night\u2019s Watch and possibly the fact that the NW will be Lightbringer in the books. \u2018By night all cloaks look black\u2019. The NW will consist of all humans united against the Others once the Long Night falls. No matter the colour of their cloaks, they will look black once darkness falls.The group face a bear where the extra men die. This was a waste of CGI budget. They could have spent it on Ghost. He is a wild beast from beyond the Wall and he would have thrived there. Nonetheless, this hints that more wild animals could fight with the Whitewalkers which makes the task that much more difficult. The group then fall on a Whitewalker and his minions. The Wights all fall once the Whitewalker who had turned them dies. This will be used as a battle technique in the future where the humans may form two groups. One, holding off the Wights whilst the second attacks the Whitewalkers and try to finish the job faster.They capture the one Wight who must have been turned by some other Walker. He acts as a beacon and alerts the others. Gendry is sent to run back to the Wall which was ridiculous. This is the very interesting part. Jon and Co take refuge on the rock whilst the Wights wait behind. The NK is present. The Whitewalkers bring winter and blizzards. The NK could have easily frozen the lake and have the Wights annihilate the humans. But he didn\u2019t. This is the only part that made the episode great. The Night King. He seems to have laid a trap and waited for Dany and her dragons. He knew there was support coming. He even had an ice javelin specifically ready for dragons. This indicates the Night King has powers we do not know yet. He must be able to \u2018see the future\u2019. Either, through visions sent to him by a deity. Or, he is a greenseer. Which would explain how he interacted with Bran in a vision in season 6 and marked him. Greenseers can send visions and maybe able to interact with each other in dreams and visions. Will the NK send Bran incorrect visions as traps? Or will Bran trap and defeat him using his greenseeing powers? We have seen previously that the NK can knock Bran out of ravens. He must be a more powerful greenseer and warg than Bran. At least at the moment. Before Bran\u2019s powers develop further. If the NK was originally a Stark, it would tie him to Bran even further. Specially, if he was a Brandon Stark.The raven travels to Dragonstone and Dany travels beyond the Wall in almost one night. The show will play even more ridiculous tricks with distance and time to fit everything in one episode. This was the most disappointing part of the episode. We also realise that Dany loves to play the mother. She hears that Jon and his men are in trouble. And she runs to help them. Whereas initially she didn\u2019t care if Jon and the whole northern population die fighting the Whitewalkers. She still has no proof that the Whitewalkers exist barring a message on a raven. Something which she had seen before. She can\u2019t help herself playing \u2018the saviour\u2019. She had no idea what awaited her beyond the Wall, or how dangerous it could be. She took her children there without any other form of support. This is probably what will cause her downfall. She has to be the saviour and rushes heedlessly into battle. The other assumption the show makes is that the northern conditions and severe cold do not affect dragons or their fire. Something which will be a focal point in the books. But not in the show. Dany burns through the Wights quite easily and so do her two other dragons. The Night King dismounts and he is handed his already made weapon. His brings down Viserion. As expected, the battle needs to be fair and Dany can not just waltz in burning her way to victory. It was a welcome sight. Score 1, for the White walkers. They can always create more Wights. But Dany can not hatch another dragon. Viserion falls to the lake and sinks in the waters. This is an allusion to the Ice Dragon, who dissolves into an icy pond when dead. This part was well done. Dany and the men get away while Jon sinks to the bottom of the lake. The NK\u2019s second shot misses Drogon. Rhaegal gets away too. Jon gets out of the lake alive and Benjen comes along to save him whilst he sacrifices himself. Benjen can not go back with him as he can not pass the magic of the Wall. Benjen\u2019s journey finally ends. It is unknown whether he is permanantly dead, or he can still be raised as a Wight. Dany clearly is worried for Jon and it is more than just comradry. Dany has feelings for him. He finally arrives at Eastwatch. There is a Targaryen ship in the sea. I am willing to forgive the dragons flying to the Wall instantaneously. But a fucking ship? You can\u2019t sail to Eastwatch from Dragonstone in the middle of winter. It is not even a direct line journey. Stops at Braavos or the Fingers are recommended. Dany realises that Jon has taken a knife to the heart. Where this leads is unknown. Something has to come of his resurrection and the coversation surrounding it. Jon is the worst damn king ever. He and Tyrion go well together. Bad Hand, worse king. Jon abandoned his kingdom and spent half the season in Dragonstone. He has failed to send ravens to Winterfell updating them. Which is not too difficult on the show. It takes 5minutes for the ravens to reach. He failed to stop by Winterfell on the way to Eastwatch. He and his de facto Hand have abandoned their men. The men they expect to fight for them and hold the north against the biggest threat in the world. Now, he bends the knee and expects the northern lords and the Vale to understand. After Dany has willingly decided to help them. This is very low from Jon. He surrendered the north and the Vale very quickly because of his feelings. The threat of the NK was always there. He resisted initially, but his feelings got the better of him and he bent the knee. I expect backlash in the north and I honestly hope Sansa takes over. She is politically astute and very strong compared to Jon at the moment. Take note that Dany changed her costume for the first time this season. She changed into Stark colours before flying to Jon\u2019s aid. A not so subtle hint that she will become a \u2018Stark\u2019 woman.I think Jon was just confirmed as a dragon rider. I say this because the ending where he gets away is revealing. The shot has him and the top part of the horse only, similar to how Dany is shown when she rides a dragon. Dany and the top part of Drogon. Usually, a wider shot of the horse and rider are shown. But Jon and a partial part of his horse were focussed on. For an extended period. I think that is foreshadowing his future on a dragon. It was basically a shot of how he may look on a dragon.The NK has his minions pull out Viserion using chains. The presence of chains, the order and the dicipline through which this is done indicates the Night King was prepared. He must have seen the future. I am very intrigued to find out more about him. Viserion is turned into a Wight dragon. He could be the tool to bring the Wall down. \u2018Nothing burns like the cold\u2019. That quote is important from the books. Viserios could melt the Wall and the NK could finally pass the Wall on a dragon. Happy times :)I have little to say about Dragonstone. Tyrion and Dany go back and forth. They both have genuine points. No war is done without bloodshed. But Dany is acting like every other ruler at the moment in spite of her claims to break the wheel. It is interesting that the succession issue comes up. She refuses to address it since she can\u2019t apparently have children. Very interesting that both Jon and Dany are lectured about \u2018children and heirs\u2019 in the same episode. It would be easier if D&D put them both in a heart shaped bed and put Marvin Gaye on. Tyrion alludes to a democracy, which I don\u2019t think Westeros is ready for. But the show may end with that. In the books, I expect a system similar to the Free Cities. Less feudalistic. Corrupt and greed oriented nonetheless.The Winterfell issue between Arya and Sansa is confusing, interesting, and generic at the same time. I expected Arya and Sansa to get along far better due to their respective maturity. Arya still doubts Sansa. Which is not fair in my opinion. Sansa was a hostage and a hostage does what is required for their own safety. Which is what Arya did in Harrenhal. I love Arya, I am not a die hard Sansa fan. Although, in the books, I respect her development, the complexity of her character and themes related to her chapters a lot. On this occassion, Sansa has the right of it. Arya is intimidating and scaring her which relates back to their differences and sisterly animosity during childhood. Sansa is quite freaked out by the faces she finds. And rightly so. Arya at the end gives Sansa a chance to prove herself as a true Stark. This will determine what happens with Littlefinger and the girls. I expected him to die this season. But he looks like he will make it to season 8. He is finally weaving some webs and it is making his character interesting once again. I am keen to see how the girls deal with him and how he is exposed.Brienne is sent to KL in Sansa\u2019s stead. She may meet with Jon there as he and Dany bring the Wight to Dragonpit. Finally, Jon can actually send a message back to the north and tell them he has \u2018bent the knee\u2019. LF should use this as an opportunity to cause more havoc in the north. This was not Jon\u2019s wisest plan. Dany had already chosen to help. She had seen the army of the dead and could not unsee it. She could no longer refuse to help even if Jon didn\u2019t bend the knee. Brienne\u2019s meeting with Jaime should be interesting. If Cersei decides not to help or double cross them, this should finally set Jaime against her. A Wight should sway Jaime. I have been waiting for Jaime to turn against Cersei. But the show won\u2019t make it happen. Maybe, in 2019. The Hound looks like he will go to KL. Cleganebowl? I am hoping for it. Un-Gregor may try to do something to Jon or Dany with the Hound stepping in the middle.I intitially disliked the episode. My second viewing gave me a different perspective. The NK, the complexity of his plot and the implications of his powers are very well done. He salvaged the episode for me. The Wights were second hand rentals from bad Resident Evil films. And the battle prior to dragons was similar to zombie films. Very average. It was no Hardhome, Winds of Winter or episode 3 of this season where Jaime ruled and embarrassed Tyrion.Bran has his hands full if the NK has greenseeing powers. The conclusion of the season should provide us with plenty of Bran and what Sam has in his books.", "It was a relatively good episode. It created a nice atmosphere (which is not to be taken for granted after the last episodes) and also had humor, emotion, and action. I\u2019d give it an 8/10.Props to Rory (Sandor), Ian (Jorah), and Richard (Beric) for their acting. Kit (Jon) also played quite well. On the contrary, I found Emilia\u2019s (Dany) acting to be very weak; even Jorah seemed more genuinely heartbroken with Viserion\u2019s death.It was nice seeing all those different characters try to get along with each other. Perhaps they were too lighthearted or focused on things that now seem unimportant, but again, \u201cthere [is] nothing like the prospect of death to make a man feel alive.\u201d They were quite a fellowship, anyway.Cinematography was very good; it focused on the fire/ice dichotomy and gave us memorable instances (e.g. the Night King aiming at the flying dragon).I was surprised when I saw the wights dissolve as soon as the Other who turned them was killed. Is that a new thing? I assume it will be of importance, but for the time being I simply find it a bit baffling. Perhaps it was just a step towards the realization that the Night King\u2019s death would be the end of the entire army (see below).The worst thing was probably the revelation/conclusion that it\u2019s enough to do something relatively minor (in this case kill the Night King) to make the entire army disband. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9d (Independence Day: the mother ship, The Return of the King: the Ring, Star Wars: the Death Star pipe) that I sincerely hoped they wouldn\u2019t use it on this show too\u2014alas, it seems I was wrong. It also gives the show runners a cheap and easy way to end the war whenever they want: the wights can conquer everything, a lot of character may die, but at the end Jon will approach the Night King, duel him, and kill him. I\u2019m categorically against that.Gendry going all the way back to the Wall running (!) and collapsing on the perfect spot, the Night\u2019s Watch sending the raven to Dany, and the dracones ex machina arriving at the right moment (in less than 40 hours or so) was another example of plot holes and cliches that we simply have to swallow.Jon calling Daenerys \u201cDany\u201d for no reason at all (How did he learn that name? Is it another Targaryen feature?) was cheesy and very unsubtle. The same goes for Beric\u2019s comment that Jon doesn\u2019t look like Ned. OK, we got it, he\u2019s a bloody Targaryen, don\u2019t hit us with a hammer every two minutes, and above all stop degrading his Stark heritage. He\u2019s supposed to look like Lyanna, who looked like Arya and Ned. End of story.The Sansa-Arya plot line was better this episode, although it\u2019s taken a bit too far. They have Bran there, for God\u2019s sake. Why not ask him everything? I liked the conclusion we are expected to reach: neither Arya would survive in Sansa\u2019s place, nor Sansa in Arya\u2019s. They are different, but equally tough and good at surviving, each in her own way.I found a bit strange the fact that Tormund used the same wording as Dany about Jon\u2019s pride and survival. Again, they hit us with a hammer to pave the ground for Jon\u2019s submission. It\u2019s cheap and unrealistic. Mance didn\u2019t bend the knee, although he was aware of the danger, and Tormund himself had once told Jon that he\u2019s not a \u201ckneeler\u201d anymore. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next, but at least I hope it\u2019s either a love affair between Jon and Dany or Jon bending the knee to ensure his people\u2019s survival, but not both.Last but not least, again very abruptly and unsubtly, the show chose to focus on Daenerys\u2019 child bearing abilities in multiple scenes. I take it as a foreshadowing that she will give birth at the end. I sincerely hope there\u2019s something tragic there. Seeing Jon and Dany\u2019s child on the Iron Throne will be way over the top.", "Another fantastic episode leaked in bad quality. Argh.Moving on -Jon & team chat up on the way North. Expected, nice, predictable. Moving on. I\u2019ll come back beyond the wall later.Daenerys and Tyrion talking about her impulse..and suddenly the conversation moves to succession? Stick to one topic, please?Arya is threatening Sansa. She really wants her to make amends. And in Arya\u2019s terms, the amends are going to be drastic. There\u2019s just so much here that seems hotch-potch -They\u2019ve met Bran. They\u2019ve seen what he is capable of. Why the hell do they not go to him with their questions? I know he seems weird, but he\u2019s been right on the money about what happened to them. Are these girls that bloody stupid!? They practically have Google in the form of Bran!Sansa has boasted about how the North is more loyal than the rest. And now when it suits the plot, it can all go to shit, of course.Sansa has repeatedly said LF is not to be trusted. And yet, he is the only one she seems to be trusting at this point. More than Arya, or Brienne, or even Bran! For God\u2019s sake, Sansa, grow a brain! Stop divulging your plans to LF of all people!LF warns Sansa about Brienne, and now Sansa has sent Brienne away. Does this mean she is planning something for Arya? What the shit is up here?WHERE IS BRAN!??Just a thought - why didn\u2019t Jon just send a raven from Dragonstone telling Winterfell he\u2019s going beyond the wall? Seems amateur and ignorant, given he is their King!Back to Tyrion & Dany on the cliffs. Tyrion is such a mess-up this season it is not even funny. First, we see him concerned about Dany\u2019s temper. Then, he walks after her kissing her ass.\u201cThe most important person in the world\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re gone, it\u2019s all lost. Everyone, everything..\u201dOh, come ON! Stop this Dany worship already! The one thing Tyrion had going for himself is that he was witty. Now he\u2019s lost even that.Back to the Wall.Extras die. Meh.Jon & co. fight a random wight-group and their leader. Sweet. Wights fall dead when the Walker dies. Expected, but thanks for the confirmation.Thoros is going to die. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised.They are eventually trapped. And Gendry - The Flash is on his way to get a message sent to Dragonstone.The water takes forever to freeze because the NK couldn\u2019t have frozen it himself? Or was he really waiting for the dragons?Speaking of it, why didn\u2019t Jon & co. just hammer the ice around to keep themselves safe longer?They are surrounded. All hope is lost. But of course we knew the dragons were on their way.Dragons burn the wights down.The NK kills Viserion instead of Drogon? I guess we\u2019ve established now that the Night King is stupid.Jon doesn\u2019t climb Drogon. He wants to show off in front of his new ladylove (worst love story) and eventually falls into the ice. But he is obviously going to come back, so why??Oh look, he\u2019s back. And there\u2019s Uncle Benjen to the rescue. Where was he all this while? Doing what?Alright, Jon comes back\u2026.again.Dany finally sees the scars and the mystery is put to rest. Nice!Jon makes a move on Dany. No matter how pretty Kit looks in this scene, I swear I could\u2019ve thrown up at the mess-up this love story is.The NK\u2019s army somehow makes chains, and puts them around Viserion\u2019s neck, underwater. But weren\u2019t they scared of water or something? Anyway\u2026Viserion opens his newly turned blue eyes. Interesting\u2026\u2026All in all, great visual (and sound, I imagine) effects, spoiled for us by the leak. Desperate attempts to build tension are not working well anymore. But of course, the CGI is epic! To be very honest, I enjoyed the Bronn vs Drogon tension a lot more.", "Alright! I watched it.Spoilers ahead!The visual affair this episode was worth it.Until I got to the end!The hand holding and loving glances.. He even started using her nickname..Still pulling at mine own hair in frustration. At least Dear Dany is rid of asking for the bent knee over and over. That\u2019s all I can say about these precious moments without going on a rant!Fight beyond the wall:I was hoping for something akin to Hardhome. Instead I got a lot of waiting around for Dany by both Jon\u2019s team and the Night king\u2019s.Daenerys was disappointing all through the episode. Apparently, I was sadder than she was when Viserion was shot down.Lots of plot armor for Jon. The Night King cares as much about him as we do. Of course he wouldn\u2019t go for Drogon with all the living people sitting on him waiting for Jon to get on board.The actual fighting sequences with the men and the dragon\u2019s were great of course.Tyrion and DanyTyrion is worried too much about Dany\u2019s succession. the discussion sprouted from nowhere for me. One moment they were arguing about the Tarlys and Tyrion was begging her for a successor the next. All this successor talk.. Combine that with the ending and we might end up with a Dany n Jon baby. (Do we have to suffer through that as well?)All this discussion and I still don\u2019t fully understand what she means by breaking and making the wheel.A cool thing I noticed. Dany was wearing the Hrakkar pelt that was Drogo\u2019s gift.Arya and SansaThey\u2019re laying the conflict between the sisters a bit too thick. I am not falling for it. But, Sansa is right. Arya would never have survived what Sansa did. Because unlike Sansa, survival wasn\u2019t really her goal.Overall would not rate it more than 3/5.", "Foreword: I have a Sky subscription, I have bought a lot of official merchandise, so I support HBO, and I will continue to pay (and watch the official releases). More for Band of Brothers (one of my favourite series ever, along with Scrubs) than for GoT seasons 5 to 7, but it\u2019s OK. So don\u2019t tell me I should not watch a leak, a leak that has been piloted. I suspect it was to placate the pissed-off jonerys fans, to be honest. I watched because there were spoilers everywhere, so I wanted to watch it myself.Tiny little remark to all of you: a wight dragon is no ice dragon.SPOILERSAs I suspected, the fight-and-magic part makes for great television. But the writing is still terrible. The usual stupid jokes, Tormund forgetting he had just seen flaming swords (he says they don\u2019t have fire to burn Thoros\u2019 body\u2026WTF? Haven\u2019t you seen the swords?). Daenerys first includes both Jorah and Jon in a list that clearly has something to do with love, then towards the end she has forgotten Jorah. Not to mention the forced steering of the story to where the season is heading by means of teenage tropoi like \u201cOMG both young, handsome and powerful = OMG LUUUUV\u201d, and \u201cOMG he almost died, so now it\u2019s LUUUUV\u201d.A nice effort in writing was Jon and Jorah\u2019s conversation about Longclaw. Longclaw clearly symbolises Daenerys\u2019 love as well. Jon says it\u2019s actually meant for Jorah, but Jorah, after touching it and looking at it, refuses it, and even says he wishes Jon can protect himself and his children. The ultimate romantic gesture, Jorah basically thinks of his former sword protecting Daenerys and her children. The smile said it all, I think.I would even like it very much if they had built Jon and Daenerys\u2019 \u201cromance\u201d better. Frankly, they still have nothing in common and are still not suited to each other, and I am curious to know what Jon will think of her choosing to execute by burning\u2026 but, hey, HBO bought the right to tell this story, and that\u2019s what we are getting.Not to mention that nobody who is undecided between two men behaves like Daenerys does in this episode, but, once again, that\u2019s what we are getting.Even worse than the steering towards Jonerys in the Jorah-Jon-Daenerys storyline is the - parallel - portrayal of Sansa as someone who is not \u201cas pure as Daenerys\u201d. Sansa is not power-hungry: she just had a different path than Arya. Those scenes were painful to watch. And, as all the \u201cJon over Jorah\u201d stuff, they were meant to \u201cconvince\u201d us that Jon luuuuvz Dany because she is pure (LOL) and will not love Sansa because she effectively rules Winterfell and has learn how to rule.Oh, and a few genius moments in writing and directing:After minutes of screen with just the suicide squad, a few red shirts appear.Wight bears attack, and, after having established in seasons of the show that fire kills them, they don\u2019t die. Jorah has the intuition to use the dragonglass. LOL, you can\u2019t even respect your lore?Beric and Thoros fight with flaming swords. Then Thoros dies. Jon orders him burned to avoid his raising as a wight. Suddenly, Tormund (and almost everyone else) has(have) forgotten they have fire and complains they have no fire. SERIOUSLY?Jorah is the hero, the fighter, and the mind. He has the intuition about the dragonglass, he notices they are on a lake, he suggests they try to end it by going for the Walkers. Not to mention what he has always done. Jon is the stupid one who continued advancing when it was time to fall back and flee. And yet the intention of the showrunners (as stated in the \u201cInside the episode\u201d) is to show that Jon is the hero - and that\u2019s obviously why a woman who had conflicted feelings forgets in a matter of seconds the one she knows best, the one who brought up the dragons with her, decides to ignore him completely to go mourn with a stranger. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?The things I liked: the fighting, the reveal that a Walker controls a number of wights, the alarm wight, Jorah being a badass and wanting to be a hero, the Hound.I think that is all. I hope the fantasy parts are bearable and enjoyable to watch, because I will still try to watch the show till the end.", "To be fair, a lot was expected from episode 6 of season 7 - something on par with Hardhome, an entry I consider one of the show's finest achievements. This episode felt more like a pot of stew, with a lot of ingredients, but ultimately half-cooked and unsatisfying.Alright, here's what I thought of the episode, with the proceedings in no particular order.We find the squad bickering and bantering north of the Wall, and no part of the exposition feels particularly new or informative. We then watch as the weather turns, and a wighted polar bear attacks the team and fatally wounds Thoros of Myr.We also briefly find ourselves at Dragonstone, with Tyrion and Dany discussing their subsequent meetup with Cersei and Co. There is yet another not-so-subtle exposition about how Jon is supposed to have fallen for Dany, and then talk of succession. Tyrion brings up the topic of Dany's supposed sterility and Dany waves it off, saying she'll consider the matters of succession once she actually gets to wear the crown. (The issue of Dany thinking she cannot have children is brought up again later in the episode, and this makes me think that she definitely isn't barren in the show-verse and will almost certainly conceive before the end of the show.)At Winterfell, Arya and Sansa are still at loggerheads. Arya accuses Sansa of helping the Lannisters murder their father, and Littlefinger's plans seem to be working as Sansa seemingly consults with him to discuss her fears after the heated conversation with her sibling. She later sends Lady Brienne away to King's Landing to represent her at the Dragonpit meeting, and I read this as Sansa's fear of Arya's growing fondness for and camaraderie with Brienne. I may be wrong. Sansa also discovers Arya's cache of faces. I do not know what to make of any of this - all of the friction may very well be a facade, a trap set up by the sisters for Littlefinger. We shall see.North of the Wall once more, the weather has turned pleasant again (or was it just dusk and dawn?) and the party spies a group of wights. Jon swiftly dispatches the White Walker and all of the wights conveniently drop dead, except for one (how did that happen?!) and the team rush to subdue it. The struggles draw the attention of other wights and Walkers, but then why didn't our team of heroes rush back home as soon as the job was complete? Also, Jon asks Gendry to run back to the Wall and write to Dany; why couldn't the whole team just run back to the Wall? And how fast is Raven-mail these days? The letter travels the length of an entire continent at the speed of light.Nevertheless, Dany turns up with all three dragons against Tyrion's advice, and this sequence is just not well handled and requires suspension of disbelief. The dragons do their flame-throwing for a bit and that's about it; Dany parks Drogon right in the middle of the action trying to rescue the team. Why didn't she target the group of White Walkers, considering that's what all this fuss is about? Why does she bring all three dragons, considering she needs only one for the rescue? Wouldn't it have been easier for her to control one, instead of two other riderless beasts, in the face of the unknown? Even more jarring is the fact that the Night King aims at a dragon flying overhead at a distance, when there's literally one sitting motionless just feet away. But whatever. Viserion is killed and later raised as a Wight. Jon has pretty thick plot armour as he survives dozens of wights, a trip into an icy lake, and has Uncle Benjen rescue him (and sacrifice himself in the process.)Dany and Jon later have a moment on their boat back home. Dany has just lost one of her 'children', and should be bawling her eyes out, mad with grief, but we hardly see any of that. Instead, she and Jon hold hands and he pledges fealty to her (why was that required, now that Dany has seen that the war for the Seven Kingdoms means nothing?!)The prospect of sending a team of the best fighters in Westeros to capture a wight and bring it to the mainland in order to convince its rulers of the threat seemed a pretty lame idea when it was proposed, and is, when put into action. The battle sequences are not convincing, and the ultimate rationale behind this whole thing seems to have been the claiming of a dragon by the Others as their own, to balance the equation. Let us hope all of the hard work put in by the All-Star team finds some use in the next episode and the subsequent season.", "Jon Snow is so fucking annoying! In real life he\u2019d have been dead like 4 seasons ago. Last season Sansa warns him, Ramsay Bolton is a bastard and will do what he can to rile him up. Dude ignores her. End\u2019s up compromising his soldiers because he can\u2019t resist the urge to behave like an idiot. Littlefinger and company arrives just in time to save his ass. This season, he comes up with an idiotic plan to capture a wight. Conveniently stumbles across a merry bunch of white walkers. Decides not to scout and find out where the main white walker army is. Grabs one of the white walkers and suddenly the whole army is upon them. Does a smart thing, sends the young dude to run for help. Which conveniently arrives just in time to save his ass. And then he inexplicably decides to go Spartan on a bunch of white walkers giving enough time for White Walker in Chief to use his magic spear and kill one of the dragons. There\u2019s just so many mistakes and errors of judgement that he makes that it\u2019s a wonder anyone follows him. The writers of the show are suffering from intellectual laziness and making Jon Snow appear like a bumbling idiot. So bloody annoying!The Hound\u2019s greatest weakness is fire. We\u2019ve seen this time and time again. I think he\u2019ll eventually go down in a spectacular fireball so that we know he\u2019s conquered his fears.This season has the most plot holes in all the GOT seasons. It\u2019s almost like the writers are tired of the show and just want to tie up all the knots whichever way they can and wrap up the show.", "Spoilers\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Great episode, minus the Night King throwing the spear. I mean come on.The Arya/Sansa stuff is interesting. It got really tense this week. In the end it's obviously going to end up with Littlefinger dead, but it's interesting. Sansa finally sees exactly how dangerous Arya has become. It's cool to see her admit that if she were going to hurt Jon, Arya would definitely kill her. She doesn't know Arya anymore.Gendry survived. Awesome, I'll sleep easier knowing that. Now all we need is his reunion with Arya and we're good.Tyrion needs to learn to quit when he's ahead. That conversation with Daenerys was going nowhere fast. If he's not careful the Tarlys won't be the only ones getting killed by a dragon.Thoros of Myr, Rest In Peace. Live by the booze, burn by the booze.Not sure why Sansa is being such a jerk to Brienne. She's absolutely right about Littlefinger.The Hound and Tormund, funny. I thought Tormund was a goner for a second. Whew. And the Hound only got people killed by throwing that rock. Really man, you're going to antagonize them?Jorah let Jon keep Longclaw. I was waiting for him to say, You keep the sword I get the girl.Redshirts down, redshirts down!Daenerys right in the nick of time. Jon being a hero. Jon being a dumb hero not getting on the dragon. Jon almost drowning. Jon almost dying. Jon being saved by Benjen. Jon getting away. Jon watching Uncle Benjen die. Jon making it to the Wall. Daenerys eyeballing Jon\u2019s scars, yep it's true he did get stabbed in the heart.Jon agreeing to bend the knee sort of makes sense. There are bigger things going on right now. Although Daenerys should totally ignore that. Doesn't almost dying count as being under duress? They'll end up in bed together, no doubt.Wight dragon, nonsense but whatever. Things can't be perfect.", "It is now official.WINTER IS HERE .Well , on one hand its sad to see that most of what people have been predicting is coming to be 100 % true .It is a well known theory that one dragon will be converted . It is true now .Dany & Jon becoming a couple is also true .As far as the episode goes ,it was filmed quite wonderfully. It isn't easy filming such huge battle scenes ,especially creating an entire set of ice & snow .As has been going on from the beginning the penultimate episode has the biggest bang & this one had more than a bang . The fight scenes were awesome.Benjen Stark returns to save Jon and sacrifices himself which was heart wrenching .The man did not get as highlighted as he should have been.Special mention needs to be given to the banter between The Hound & Tormund . It was hilarious.The season finale has been setup well with the showdown between Sansa & Little Finger .Now im sure the much anticipated meeting between Dany ,Cersei ,Jon ,Tyrion will happen . On the whole after a damp fourth & fifth seasons this season was mostly awesome.", "This episode was pretty much terrible from start to finish. All style, no substance.Just about everything that happened north of the Wall occurred \u2014 not because it was a natural consequence of the characters\u2019 actions, but simply because the writers felt it would be convenient (for them) if it happened that way.Consider this quote from series producer D.B. Weiss when discussing the \u201clake of ice\u201d in Beyond the Wall:\u201cWe were thinking: how can you possibly survive that situation [being chased by an army of the dead]? That was the thing that was hardest for us.\u201dIt seems to me that if you\u2019re having to manhandle the plot like this to produce a desirable outcome for your principal characters, then maybe you need to rethink your plot.Let\u2019s review some of the more egregious offenders of this principle from Beyond the Wall:Jon leads an all-star team of main characters and no-named, red shirt wearing soldiers on a veritable suicide mission to capture a zombie.Natural Consequence: All or most of them die, including Jon.Convenient Outcome: The least important main character and all the redshirts die. All the most important characters live to fight another day.Jon and Co. stumble across some of the army of the dead.Natural Consequence: There\u2019s too many of them, no chance of taking a zombie captive.Convenient Outcome: Only one White Walker and a handful of zombies far removed from everyone else? Easy peasy.Jon kills a White Walker, which apparently severs the connection to the zombies and turns them back into corpses.Natural Consequence: Shit! Guess we need to find another small unit of zombie soldiers to ambush.Convenient Outcome: Huzzah! Exactly one of the zombies is miraculously still animated. Now we can take it captive and complete the mission.Zombie scream alerts the rest of the army of the dead, everyone flees for their lives.Natural Consequence: Everyone dies.Convenient Outcome: There\u2019s a rock protruding from a lake of ice, and the entire perimeter of the lake gives out when the zombies try to cross it. But not when our heroes cross it of course. Then the White Walkers decide to stand around and wait for it to frost over again instead of trying to do literally anything else. Quick: tell the people of Westeros that the solution to the White Walker invasion is: building a moat.Gendry is told to go send a raven to Daenerys.Natural Consequence: Gendry gets lost, or freezes to death, or runs out of time, but probably all of the above.Convenient Outcome: Gendry is the fastest man in the world, and the greatest navigator to boot. Thanks to Davos\u2019 24-hour scout service, Gendry is rescued from the cold, and supersonic ravens are dispatched to Dragonstone. Dany is ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice, and \u2014 like the ravens \u2014 is apparently able to cross half the continent in under an hour to make it to our heroes in danger. How does she even find them without knowing their exact location? Who knows, who cares apparently (certainly not the writers).Dany shows up, Night\u2019s King pulls out a spear, takes aim at Drogon.Natural Consequence: Dany loses her favorite dragon.Convenient Outcome: Let\u2019s kill one of the other dragons, no one really cares about them.Jon decides to waste time fighting zombies instead of getting on the dragon, gets predictably left behind.Natural Consequence: Jon dies. Again. Maybe gets saved by one of the other dragons if we\u2019re being charitable.Convenient Outcome: Jon\u2019s long-lost uncle shows up out of literally nowhere to save him. Then sacrifices himself by not getting on the horse with him so we can succinctly close the loop on this plot thread, even though it would have taken all of a half second for him to get on the horse with Jon and ensure he made it back to the Wall safely.Ugh, what a mess. The Winds of Winter can\u2019t come soon enough.", "Beyond the Wall is one of those rare hours of television that stuns you into inaction. Its biggest achievement lies in taking events that you can see coming and managing to still create moments of palpable tension from them.No One is going to harm you, dear SansaOne complaint I\u2019ve had with the big set-piece episodes of the past \u2014 The Laws of Gods and Men, Hardhome, The Door \u2014 is that all their secondary arcs feel like underwhelming fillers. Beyond the Wall circumvents even this pitfall.In the feisty scenes at Winterfell, we get a sense of why Arya is being so mean to Sansa \u2014 she thinks Sansa is still the child of privilege that she knew back in season 1, before the two sisters separated. Unlike the audience, Arya hasn\u2019t seen the extent to which Sansa has been tormented, and fails to appreciate the soft courage it takes to simply survive. But even though we can now understand Arya\u2019s psyche, she is still unequivocally wrong.Littlefinger\u2019s machinations are playing out smartly as usual. A lot of Arya fans suspect that she\u2019s actually leading him down a trap; this feels like a twist more suited to an Abbas-Mustan film than Thrones, as we\u2019ve got no indication so far that Arya is wise to Littlefinger\u2019s act. Of course, all bets are off if Bran intervenes with some timely exposition that exposes our expert ex-pimp.Such is the luck of Littlefinger that even when his plans fail to materialize \u2014 like when his sinister use case for Brienne gets foiled by Sansa sending her to King\u2019s Landing \u2014 it still serves his end goal of wanting to isolate Sansa from all her well-wishers save himself.Also, given Brienne\u2019s history with Jaime, her presence in the capital is only going to incite further annoyance and mistrust in an already testy Cersei.First Success, then SuccessionWhen not dropping Easter eggs about Jon being Dany\u2019s \u2018little\u2019 nephew, the events at Dragonstone feature Tyrion trying to cogently coax his queen into formulating a succession plan. It was fun watching Tyrion channel his inner B-grade management guru, even if Dany was least interested in planning for a future that didn\u2019t feature herself.Blue Eyes ft. YoYo Night King-uhh!I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again \u2014 objectively reviewing any episode featuring the Night King is one of the most difficult jobs around (right below being the Trump administration\u2019s Press Secretary, Communications Director and Chief Strategist).On a second viewing, a lot of suspect decision-making starts to appear \u2014 why didn\u2019t Beric use his flaming sword to provide heat to his entourage from the start? Why didn\u2019t he use it to melt the ice around them? Why did the wights not keep literally testing the waters and see if it had frozen? Why didn\u2019t expert Javelin thrower Night King start launching spears at Jon&Co when they were all but sitting ducks?However, I was only able to do this nitpicking much later. The first time that I saw Beyond the Wall, I was floored by its riveting sequences, immaculate pacing and stunning visuals.The increased length of the episode lets it employ methods from the Tarantino playbook and organically build tension, as characters nonchalantly recount countless tales of yore while marching on towards life-threatening danger.The reason the episode was so compelling was that it featured a whole host of great characters that were plausibly expendable in a fight of this magnitude \u2014 The Hound could have been killed by the flaming bear from The Revenant; Gendry could have done a Pheidippides and died after reaching the Wall; Beric Dondarrion might have charged foolhardily to kill the Night King and lost his final life; Tormund could have been pulled into the water by the wights; even Jon could have drowned, only to be resurrected as the ultimate White Walker. I\u2019ll admit the last scenario was unlikely, but I still wasn\u2019t willing to bet on it, given that the show is supposed to end with a battle between fire and ice, and Jon\u2019s last name is Snow.So when it was Thoros who parted company with us, I heaved a sigh of relief. Disaster averted; Dany saves the day; and all that jazz. Boy, was I wrong!Drogon being such an attention-hogging queen means that his siblings have become interchangeable to the point that I can\u2019t definitively tell you which one it was who changed allegiance to the side of ice. However, with Jon all set to ride the other dragon beside aunt Dany, I\u2019m willing to wager that it\u2019s Rhaegal (named after Jon\u2019s father, Rhaegar) who survived.The last scene between Jon and Dany was genuinely tender. Jon\u2019s decision to pledge allegiance to Dany makes complete sense \u2014 she just saved his ass, and even Tormund is advocating that Jon swallow his pride and exalt her as the queen. Interestingly, while everyone else has been vocal about the palpable sexual chemistry at play between our Targaryens, the duo themselves have been tellingly non-committal to a point where they might yet avert the awkwardness that will undoubtedly arise when Bran reveals how they\u2019re truly related.Complete as it was with a chilling ending of great moment, Beyond the Wall was a bonafide spectacle whose sheer scale effortlessly surpasses anything and everything that we\u2019ve seen on television before.I presume that the next episode, much like last season\u2019s finale, will now turn the focus to Cersei and her political pyrotechnics. And I for one, can\u2019t wait.", "Good episode which doesn\u2019t sacrifice its minor arcs. Long review.Let\u2019s start with the Dragon in the room. The big fight between the Living and the Dead, or a preview at least involving new players - Dragons.The scene up north starts with all the characters exploring their common connections and pasts and chit chatting their journey away till the time they find a Wight to captureJon and Jorah bonded over their dead fathers. Jorah admitted that Ned was in the right, even though he wanted to execute him. Jon, as suspected, offered Longclaw to Jorah, who, as suspected, declined itTormund brought up Mance, his pride and what it meant to his people, to JonGendry was basically told to grow up by BwB team featuring HoundJorah admired Thoros on his charge during the Battle of PykeTormund and Hound connected over BrienneBeric and Jon connected over their experiecnes with Death and their purpose (Death is the enemy)They found their Wight, but plans seldom go as planned. So after giving instruction to Gendry (Run, Gendry, Run) to call for Dany and her dragons, the group made their stand between a frozen lake.The battle scenes were great. All the main characters contributed, slaying (??) the Wights left, right, and center and even the extras got few strokes in, before they were killed. Jon got some solo screen time as well when he mowed through the lines of Wights trying to ensure that everyone was on-board Drogon.Entry of Dragons was again impressive. It is clear that GoT producers have done their work diligently when it comes to dragons. Their arrival and destruction they can cause has been captured in glorious detail.And then came the heart wrenching part. Night King killed Viserion. It was beautifully done. It was so sad to watch him crash on ice and just slink away in the waters. It would have been even effective if we could have seen him in action before, maybe playing with his mother. The scene would have been 1000x more heart breaking. Still, I was sad, more than what I expected, watching him dieJon missed the escape along side his team and Dany but was saved by his long lost uncle Benjen. If books will not give you a closure, the show will.Night King - this dude has all the chill in the world. You just can\u2019t faze him. Three dragons - all good, takes a spear and kills one. Then asks for another spear to kill another one. In the end, gets these huge chains and retrieves the body from water and creates his own personal Wight dragon to ride on. All this without even breaking a sweat.Jon and Dany - This is settled, if they both live, they are going to marry each other. The scene at the end was just a step short of their engagement. In the scenes prior, it was set up that they have hots for each other and in this scene they all but admitted their feelings to each other. Jon is ready to bend the knee, it doesn't matter anymore as the Queen will be on his side anyways.Special mention to Emilia who went through all the emotion in this scene convincingly. Teatful to solemn to anger to surprised to hesitant to relieved to bashful - it was all there in minutes. Good jobArya and Sansa - The scenes between them had real bite and the tension was clearly evident. By the last scene, Sansa was actually fearful of her life.Arya let out all her negative thoughts about Sansa immediately after sharing a poignant memory about their father. Arya has a lot of suppressed hate towards Sansa and it all came out in a torrent of accusations. Sansa basically just took the punches and gave back only once or twice. Shows about their characters, Sansa was ever the politician, trying to work things out, and Arya an assassin, straight and to the point.Arya\u2019s jibe about Little Lyanna Mormont was good\u201cSansa - Sometimes anger make people do unfortunate things\u201d; \u201cArya - Sometimes fear make people do unfortunate things, I\u2019ll stick with Anger\u201dLittlefinger mentioned Brienne in passing that she is honor bound to intercede if one Sister is about to harm other and the next thing you know Brienne is sent packing to King's Landing. The show is sending clear hints that Arya and Sansa will come to swords (figuratively) in next episodeAgain strongly referenced in their next scene when Sansa discovers the faces. She is scared of Arya and Arya with her creepy dialogues (I can even become you, wonder what it would feel like to be Lady of Winterfell, all I need to find out is your face) is clearly not helpingIf the show does a 180 and suddenly makes them best of sisters, I hope they do give some backstory of how their differences were resolved rather than pulling a fast oneDany and Tyrion - They get to verbally spar out some of their grievances towards each otherWhile Dany assured her trust in Tyrion, she questioned him and his loyalty on some points and Tyrion didn\u2019t mince his words when he brought up some recent events. The scene covered the things that needed to be said from both sides. Tyrion worrying about Dany\u2019s temper and Dany unsure about Tyrion\u2019s clever little schemesEven after all his good intentions and advises to Dany, the parting two were not which Dany liked, for good reasons of her own - trying to discuss succession and asking her not to go to Jon\u2019s aid\u201cWhen have I lost my temper\u201d, oh Dany, so funny\u201cTyrion - I plan for Long term\u201d; \u201cDany - Perhaps if you would have planned for short term, we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden\u201dAll in all a solid episode with some good story building in the minor arcs as well.Image source - Mashable", "My answer will be a bit different from everyone else because I\u2019m not doing a blow-by-blow of every scene in sequence and filling in with my commentary.Visually this episode was great. Loved the locations and camera shots. Dialog was okay but not great. HOWEVER \u2014\u2014 the plot had so many holes in it I could drive a tractor-trailer through them.We are given wight bears near the beginning to establish that large animals can be turned into wights \u2014 something we only saw previously with horses. Setting us up for what was to come.John set a trap for that small band of wights \u2014 with no plans to capture them aside from one hood and some ropes? No\u2014all but one of them gets destroyed. The heck? Would it not have been more effective to have means/plans for capturing more than one? Get in, get out.How did the ice king know a dragon would show up? For what other reason would he have that long ice lance? How did he know? Are the wights like the borg, where once one is assimilated the leader knows everything they know? That part was not believable.John coming back up from the water? Pleeeaaassee. He had that big cloak on and all the layers underneath, and yet, with all those wights hanging onto him, he managed to get himself back up? From freezing cold water? Nope. Don\u2019t believe it.The wights that fell in the water \u2026. why didn\u2019t they come back up? The wights can walk, run, and climb. Why can\u2019t they swim? Is it because the water is so freezing cold that they go into hibernation or what?And what is with the chains that pull the dragon back up?? HOW did the wights get those chains? They can\u2019t be around fire \u2014 how did forge it? Where did they get the metal for the forging? WHY are they carrying around great huge bloody big chains in the first place????? And see above \u2014 if the freezing cold water puts them into hibernation and so they can\u2019t swim out \u2014- how did the chains get around the dragon to begin with??? HUGE plot hole right there. Makes no sense.Then the Tyrion / Danerys scene. First she seems to praise and compliment him. Then, later in the conversation (once AGAIN) she suddenly distrusts his motives. Make up your mind already! And we (once AGAIN) get a scene of her striding off to her dragon and Tyrion saying his same lines of \u201cNo, you mustn\u2019t. If anything should happen\u2026!!\u201d Bleh. Give these two different lines already. And either she trusts him or she doesn\u2019t.The writers are creating a lot of confusion and ambiguity around the Sansa/Arya relationship and it seems like they are just dragging things out to save time. I don\u2019t like what they are doing with these two characters \u2014 they are not staying true to who they are.What \u2014 no Sam this episode?

All around you surrounds a damn military of living dead ice vampires, from every which way, held back merely by an easily breakable surface of a frozen lake- until they are held back no more. They charge, getting closer by the second. What do you do? Do you live? Do you die?Hold your breath, dragon ladies and gentle wolves! Hard truths come out as she-wolves fight amongst themselves, a new explosive secret about the Army of the Dead is revealed, a longtime character parts from this world, the adrenaline explodes off the charts, a character mourns a shattering death, and the ultimate Song of Ice and Fire is sung at last- the moment we've all been waiting for (for old-time book fans, since 1996), in the insane penultimate episode before the grand season finale; Game of Thrones, Season 7, Episode 6: \"Death Is the Enemy\". Here we go!First things first: is the fact the sea near Eastwatch unfrozen now an inconsistency and continuity issue, or something more? It seems the plot needed the sea flowing freely, in which case why freeze it to begin with?We begin with an elegant close-up moving shot of the carved Westeros map in the Dragonstone Council Room, moving north in the direction our pack are heading to.Cut to an extremely epic shot of our seven heroes passing through the ice-cold mountains beyond the Wall.This episode is packed with hilarious and often meaningful small talks between the guys, starting right in the opening scene. Tormund praises the value of f***ing, Jon says there are no women around, to which Tormund replies: \"We have to make do with what we've got\" (Jon smiles in amusement while Gendry is in shock and discomfort).Jon then updates his ginger wildling friend of \"the Dragon Queen\" and his refusal to bend the knee. Tormund reminisce about Mance Rayder, the King Beyond the Wall who Jon himself tried persuading to bend the knee to a different, doomed king, Stannis Baratheon; Tormund asks Jon \"how many of his people died for his (Mance's) pride?\". I've gotta say this exchange rings uncharacteristic for me, since Tormund always admired Mance and has been his right hand man since forever, and when you think about, Mance's refusal to bend the knee had nothing to do with pride- it was a matter of principal. The Free Folk had their own lands (\"kingdom\" so to speak) and so do the Northerners. I don't think Jon really has any obligation to kneel before Daenerys, the North trusts him to be a king, separated from all other political cancers and the seven kingdoms games. Of course Tormund's words are meant to sway us to believe Jon is being stubborn and prideful, and that Dany is the right one here, when in fact it's the exact opposite. This dialogue foreshadows the future of this season's To Kneel Or Not To Kneel Arc, which (thank God!) will be resolved later this episode).A short, not particularly significant but nevertheless amusing, well-performed and necessary exchange between Gendry and the Brotherhood Without Banners, sees Gendry expressing his frustrations with Thoros and Beric (\"you sold me to a WITCH!\") only to hilariously be roasted by the Hound who practically dismisses his rightful rage as \"whiny\". Apply water to the burned area!Jorah and Jon finally have time for a meaningful interaction and they connect quite easily. Their conversation surrounds around their fathers initially. Both of these men knew each others' father: while Jon was the steward of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, and admired him- Jorah would be executed if the honorable Eddard Stark had caught him. Jon loved Jorah's father. Jorah hated Jon's father (well, uncle / stepfather, of course). It's interesting to note that both Jorah and Jon think less of themselves. I didn't ever see this coming, but they resemble each other. Jon takes out Longclaw, the sword Jeor gave him, and wants to return it to his rightful owner: Jorah. But our man the Andal wouldn't take it: \"I brought shame to our house. It broke my father's heart. I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well. And your children after you\". On the obvious level, it fully fleshes out Jorah's character. It also means Jon will keep wielding Longclaw, therefore probably not the legendary sword Dawn / the Sword of the Morning (which belonged to Arthur Dayne, and many fans speculate that it is this particular sword that Azor Ahai will plunge into his beloved Nissa Nissa's heart, forging the flaming Lightbringer from it). The fact Jon will not wield Dawn (or so it seems) could either mean the prophecy is not as literal as you'd guess, OR that Jon himself will NOT become Azor Ahai reborn. I still think if he is Azor Ahai, then Ygritte was his Nissa Nissa, and Lightbringer would actually be the Night's Watch, and not an actual fiery sword. But the show's direction could very well mean Dany will be Nissa Nissa, therefore Jon will have to kill her to create Lightbringer. On a more literary note, I believe that Jorah giving up his sword has another meaning- if Longclaw is an analogy to Dany, then Jorah basically gives Jon his blessing to pursuit her.South of the Wall, at Winterfell, we get a touching family moment that turns monstrously wrong. Arya tells Sansa of one time she discreetly shot arrows, and Ned clapped his hands, and felt nothing but pride and approval of Arya's nature which is a stark (pun intended!) contrast to Westerosi society's customs. It feels like such a warm sisterly bonding moment, that what follows really saddens me: Arya says: \"Now he's dead, killed by the Lannister, with your help\". Sansa is baffled and shocked at this, and Arya pulls out the letter she found in Littlefinger's room in the previous episode, and reads it. It was only a matter of bloody time til Sansa's ancient past na\u00efve and misguided choices came back to haunt her- what goes around comes around to bite you in the ass in the end. This reminds us how Season 1 Sansa really did seem to be a somewhat negative character who might betray her family, and it reminds us she lied about Joffrey hitting the Butcher's Boy, causing his and her direwolf Lady's deaths, and most importantly, telling Cersei of Ned's plan to escape King's Landing (which arguably means Sansa's actions caused his death and the demise of house Stark). Sansa tries to reason with Arya, explaining the circumstances, but Arya stubbornly and blindly refuses to understand the complexity of the situation. In a poignant moment, Sansa learns that Arya was there, near Baelor's statue at Ned's execution, all those years ago. After several verbal offences aimed at her, Sansa finally disrupts and fights back: \"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back, he lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knights of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me, while you were off- where- travelling the world? While you were training, I suffered things you could never imagine. You never would've survived what I survived\". It is the tipping point for Sansa, and she puts in words what many people have thought for years about them: Sansa and Arya went through wildly different tragedies and journeys, and had their places been replaced, they both would never have survived what the other suffered- Sansa wouldn't be able to fight and run for her life as Arya did, and Arya would never be polite, politically correct or royal material to live through Joffrey, Littlefinger and Ramsay's abuse and manipulations as Sansa have. Anyway, back to the point, Sansa asks Arya what is she going to do with the letter, and Arya threatens to expose it to the northern lords. Their verbal duel ends with Sansa trying to calm Arya down saying she's angry, and \"Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things\"; Arya's response? \"Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger\". It was quite clear from the previous episode they were going to new lows of family feud, and it's actually very realistic and good that they vent out all of their suppressed disdain and competition that was festering their souls ever since childhood.We return to our Dream Team over the frozen lands. Another marvelous humorous dialogue ensues, this time between Sandor and Tormund. The ginger irritates the dog constantly. When Tormund is interested with Sandor's scarring, he correctly reads his true nature: \"You're not really mean. You have fair eyes\". The following sentences had me laughing out loud:The Hound: \"Do you want to suck my dick, is that it?\".Tormund: \"Dick?\"The Hound: \"Cock\"Tormund: \"Dick\u2026 I like it.\"The Hound: \"Bet you do.\"What's with all the gay jokes..???I think Renly, Loras and Yara wouldn't approve of this stereotypical stand-up.Anyway, the conversation continues as Tormund tells him of his infatuation with a certain tall, blonde, muscular, tough, ethical lady knight. You know, only the same woman who mortally wounded Sandor in the Season 4 finale when she literally bitten his ear off- Brienne.Next on the Talk Show round are Jon and Beric. Beric tells Jon he doesn't look much like his father (\"I suppose you favor your mother\"), which is ironic, because Jon resembles his real mother Lyanna and doesn't look a lot like his real father Rhaegar- luckily for him since King Robert would've killed him for it, and the person who Beric talks about (Ned) is actually not his biological father but his uncle and adoptive stepfather. After that, Beric tells Jon what he's really fighting for.Beric: \"I'm not fighting for some man or woman to sit on a throne made of swords.\"Jon: \"So what are you fighting for?\"Beric: \"Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.\"Jon: \"But we all die.\"Beric: \"The enemy always wins\u2026 And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I won't find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.\"Jon: \"I'm the shield that guards the realms of men\u2026\"Beric: \"Maybe we don't need to understand more than that. Maybe that's enough.\"The Hound recognizes the mountain that looks like an arrowhead from the vision he saw in the flames in the season premiere. Does it look in any way familiar, you guys..??? That's because we've been here before. Well, maybe not physically, but mentally. This is the exact spot in Bran's vision where he saw the army of the dead, where the Night King gave him the mark on his hand, back in the season 6 episode \"The Door\". The gang realizes they must be getting close. I find it a little bit ridiculous that they are only following directions from \"visions in flames\", but never mind.The next scene jumps to the Council Room in Dragonstone, where, for once, Daenerys and Tyrion are the only two people present, and not a clusterfuck of characters (a relief). In their debating they're contemplating the nature of heroism, her impending new romantic conquest, the moral dilemmas she is facing, the complexity of securing the Iron Throne and her legacy.Dany: \"Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this\u2026 Jon Snow. They all try to outdo each other, of who can do the stupidest and bravest thing.\"Tyrion: \"It's interesting, the heroes you name: Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this\u2026 Jon Snow\u2026 They all fell in love with you.\"Dany: \"Jon Snow is not in love with me.\"Tyrion: \"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.\"Dany: \"He's too little for me. I didn't mean-\"Tyrion: \"As heroes go, he is, quite little.\"Moving on, they discuss their future plan on how to deal with Cersei, Dany once again voices her paranoia that he is on the Lannister side, Tyrion brings up her latest impulsive temper tantrum burning the Tarlys and suddenly the tension increases:Dany: \"One could be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.\"Tyrion: \"I am taking their side. You need to take your enemy's side if you're going to see things the way they do, and you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them. Which I want you to do very much because I believe in you and in the world you want to build. But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once, probably not in a single lifetime. How do we ensure your vision endures? After you break the wheel, how do you make sure it stays broken?\"Dany: \"You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead. Is that it?\"Tyrion: \"You say you can't have children. But there are other ways of choosing a successor\u2026\"Dany: \"We'll discuss the succession after I wear the crown.\"Tyrion admits he thinks they should think in the long term. After all these lectures, Dany finally speaks my thoughts when she reminds him how poorly he failed by not thinking in the short term at all: let's face it friends, for all his wisdom and amazing perceptiveness, and despite my great love for him, Season 7 Tyrion has been a walking talking miniature disaster as the Hand of the Queen. With that said, her suspicion and animosity towards him is still through the roof, and I'm suddenly wondering if maybe she isn't overreacting as I want to think, but actually truly sees into his heart. This discussion of theirs makes me predict that when all is said and done, after Dany and the entire world knows Jon's real father's identity (regardless of what may come of their romantic relationship) Dany will name Jon- her nephew- as her legal heir; which is funny since he himself has the better claim.Next, things finally starts cooking, and the action begins: a Wight bear emerges and attacks our good lads. First they kill off one of the random unnamed characters (rest in peace, Nameless Wilding #1) then it's bear on bear action (since Jorah, and the Mormonts in general, live on Bear Island and are sometimes referred to as such), and finally, after crossing paths with numerous characters, the deadly beast give mortal wounds that eventually takes a life of one minor yet old pal- Thoros. The only detrimental effect his death has, is taking away Beric's ability to come back to life- this is his last life. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, Thoros still has some small time to live.Meanwhile in Winterfell, Sansa seeks guidance and counsel in the most unreliable and untrustworthy person she could ever turn to- Petyr. A short (seemingly trivial) detail she blurts out, is that she hasn't heard from Jon in weeks. This confirms my worry that Jon has completely forgotten he is a king with responsibilities other than fighting White Walkers. Petyr proposes that Sansa should put Brienne into action- she swore a vow to protect both Stark daughters, so if any of the sisters lays hand on the other, she is sworn to intervene.Way up north, Jorah asks the dying Thoros about a battle he fought years ago during the Greyjoy Rebellion (the event that caused Theon to be taken hostage and later being raised in Winterfell with the Starks). Jorah says the Ironborn thought he was some kind of God with his flaming sword, Jorah himself says he thought he was the bravest man alive, but Thoros responds: \"Just the drunkest\". It's important to note that Thoros really wasn't much of a heroic figure, and his death wasn't as sacrificial and courageous as Syrio Forrel's, Hodor's, Yoren's etc. Sometimes, people's death aren't as glorious as in fairytales. And Game of Thrones is certainly no fairytale.Soon after, the gang comes face to face with wights and a White Walker for the first time in their little road trip. They set up a trap (a nicely lit bonfire to attract the dead) and then storm them. The fight intensifies. Jorah's throat is nearly choked out of breathe, but then suddenly, as Jon kills the commanding funny-looking White Walker, almost all the wights crumble to pieces. This, folks, is a great secret which means something very good: whenever you kill a White Walker you kill any Wight he ever raised with it. This explosive information means a new simple strategy is in order. Between fire, dragonglass, Valyrian steel and now this- it almost starting to look like our beloved characters can beat them! However I wouldn't be so confident, just wait until the end of this episode\u2026 A single lone Wight still stands (how incredibly and conveniently lucky) and needless to say the Fellowship binds him and drags him along. So, the hard part (catching a Wight) is over, right? All that's left to do now is to go back home\u2026 Right\u2026?Think again.After the creature makes a shrieking, noisy signal, an alarmingly huge army of wights and walkers approaches. Jon commands Gendry to run as fast as Speedy Gonzales to send a raven calling for help. The army chases Jon and co. until they reach a small rocky island in the middle of a frozen lake, and the frozen ice surface of the lake is too fragile for the dead to approach (assumingly). They stop because the ice would break and they'd sink- apparently they can't swim, as the battle of Hardhome already implied. It seems a bit ridiculous to me: Jon said himself, the dead brings the cold, not the other way around. But their wait might have an explanation in the end of the episode. As Gendry collapses just at the gates of Eastwatch-By-the-Sea in time for Davos to rescue him and get his message, the team stands isolated on the Rock Island and surrounded from all directions. Jon and the others are positioned there for the entirety of one chilling night.Come the morning and Thoros is dead. It's nearly poetic when he- the messenger of the R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the fire God- dies freezing. Beric enflames his sword to burn his body.It was the easiest decision to kill off Thoros of Myr, the drunken Red Priest, of all the people: Jon already died once, and his final death must mean a lot and probably not occur in this season; The Hound still needs to face his brother Gregor \"the Mountain\" Clegane in the promising Cleganebowl; Gendry JUST returned to us so he better bear some significance; Beric should only die in order to save another important character's life, like with Lady Stoneheart from the books; although Jorah doesn't seem to have an important role other than his redemption arc, he just got cured from Greyscale, although he hasn't met his relative Lyanna yet; I guess Tormund could've died either, since his crush on Brienne isn't this crucial to the destiny of Westerosi-kind. The \"bold cunt\" is the least prominent character, and that's who the writers chose to eliminate, which begs the question: is the show going soft on us? So far, this entire season, no major character has died (the closest to main character to have bitten the dust by now is Lady Olenna Tyrell).Jon contemplates his options, and Beric suggests killing the Night King, since he is the one who raised all the White Walkers, so virtually it should kill the entire army for good.Sansa does the exact opposite of Littlefinger's advice: after being invited to King's Landing (which can only lead to no good) she sends Brienne and Podrick instead. This isolates her, leaving her with nobody to protect her from Littlefinger or Arya (except crippled and uncaring computer-minded Bran). Brienne's journey to King's Landing assures us an exciting and emotional reunion (and possibly a conclusion) to her and Jaime's gently hinted love story. Sansa wants to show she's independent and strong on her own. But it's was probably reverse psychology and exactly what Littlefinger planned.A short scene in Dragonstone shows Dany and her dragons leaving Tyrion behind to go help Jon, in what majestically spoils the element of surprise.The fight continues.The Hound hilariously picks one particular Wight and throws rocks at him. It's all fine and dandy until the rock lands on the surface, alerting all the army that the ice is now steady enough. Quickly the largest, most badass and blood pumping battle of the season takes place. Amidst all the action, Tormund finds himself in mortal danger, is wounded and nearly pulled underwater by wights, but the Hound saves his life. As the comrades climb upon the small cliff, and the music and photography begins to go slow motion, the obvious Deus Ex Machina momentum , and with it the most stunning and thrilling part of the episode. The following battle sequence is priceless, one of the series' most anticipated moments: the song of ice and fire, literally.Out of the blue, Dany and all her magnificent gigantic children arrive: Rhaegal, Viserion and Drogon. They burn the wights like a piece of cake, as Jon and the rest stand and stare, stunned. Dany offers Jon her hand to climb on Drogon's back, when a Wight approaches and, like all chivalrous knights, Jon turns to fight. As the fellowship (all but Jon) hop on Drogon's back and take the Wight hostage with them, the Night King takes an ice spear and aims upwards, and then\u2026 a tragedy.Viserion is shot, dives uncontrollably downwards, hits the surface of the icy lake, and drowns slowly into the water.Everybody is speechless and mortified, but none more than Dany, who just lost a child. Jon's response to the dragon's death is pure rage, as he storms wights right and left, with murderous anger pounding through his veins. As he spots another ice spear in the Night King's hand, he yells at Dany: \"GO! GO, NOW, LEAVE!\". As wights pull Jon underwater, possibly to drown, Dany is visibly hesitant and conflicted, but seeing the spear in the NK's arm she soars to escape. The fact the Night King has these precisely fitting weapons makes me wonder\u2026Shortly after, Jon arises out of the freezing water (because who's ever heard of hypothermia), about to face the army all by himself, and is again very close to death's cold embrace, but as the dead approach, a hooded horse-riding figure make way with a swinging fireball, and what do you know- it's the half-dead Uncle Benjen! As a reminder, he is the Night's Watch top ranger who inspired Jon to join the Watch to begin with, disappeared back in season 1, reappeared just to save Bran and Meera in season 6, and now is reunited with Jon, finally- however brief and tragic it might be. Benjen clears the horse for Jon to ride, says there's no time for him to join him, and stalls the army, probably to his demise. Jon rides away in exhaustion. I don't know if this is the last we've seen of Benjen Stark, but God bless him. Jon has a pretty amazing family: a fierce political prodigal sister (Sansa), a warg greenseer all-knowing brother (Bran), a powerful lethal face-changing serial killer sister (Arya), a Wightslayer rider uncle (Benjen) and an impressive dragon-rider queen aunt (Dany).The Hound, Beric and Tormund put the captured Wight on a boat and part ways (for some reason). Dany and Jorah watch over the Lands of Always Winter from the Wall at Eastwatch, just in time to witness Jon's arrival. As Jon's clothes are taken off to attend his wounds, Dany finally sees the wounds from the multiple stabbing (the assassination by his Night Watch brothers in the season 5 finale) that claimed his first life- proving to her that he literally did take a knife to the heart and lived through it.Sansa sneaks in Arya's room to snoop around, terrifyingly finds her dead face-masks (CREEPY STUFF) and is busted by the little psycho herself.Arya: Back in Braavos, before I got my first face, there was a game I used to play. The Game of Faces. It's simple, I ask you a question about yourself, and you try make lies sound like the truth. If you fool me, you win. If I catch a lie, you lose. Let's play.Sansa: I don't want to play.Arya: How do you feel about Jon being king? Is there someone else you think should rule the North instead of him?Sansa: Those faces. What are they?Arya: You want to be asking? Are you sure? The Game of Faces didn't turn out so well for last person who asked me questions.Sansa: Tell me what they are!Arya: We both wanted to be other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen. To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight. To pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us ever got to be that person, did we? The world doesn't just let girls decide what they're going to be. But I can now. With the faces I can choose. I can become someone else. Speak in their voice. Live in their skin. I can even become you. I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses. To be the lady of Winterfell. All I need to find out\u2026 is your face.This has got to be one the most intense confrontations in the show's entire history. Is a girl finally no one? Arya's threats are jaw-dropping. I fear for both Sansa's life and Arya's soul. I gotta say, I've always preferred Arya over Sansa, but this season I've changed my mind. As partially true as some of her statements and motivations are, Arya's behavior towards Sansa is immature, childish and borderline psychotic. Sansa on the other hand just doesn't want things to escalate. Sansa is mature, grown up, opinionated and independent, clearly overcoming her past tragedies and learning. Arya seems to dwell on the past, behave stupefyingly immature and what was once a dark side and justice-motivated-revenge on mostly bad people is now openly threatening her own sister! Granted, it's probably a play to deceive Littlefinger, but I think she doesn't TELL Sansa that she doesn't mean all that... Regardless of Littlefinger's clear imminent doom, the Stark sisters' words, actions and reactions are all convincingly genuine and true. I'm not sure if Arya and Sansa's past justify this amount of rivalry, and I don't think Arya's character would do that (more clues to how it's probably a play). The fact Arya handed the dagger and just walked away is a real mindfuck, because we don't understand what is happening here. Is this a truce? A threat? A hint for Sansa to stab Littlefinger? This storyline is very unexpected, and though it's a little overdramatic and offbeat to the point I originally despised it, when I re-watched it I find it's actually a brilliant and clever plotline. Sansa seems genuinely afraid for her life. I swear if Arya kills Sansa (or vice versa) I'm rioting in the streets!By the way, though I\u2019m not a fan of this whole Starkbowl business, I got to hand it to Maisie and Sophie- they are spot on, and their words feel true even knowing it\u2019s probably just a coy to confuse Littlefinger.On a ship in the middle of the Narrow Sea, Jon awakens to find a tearful sad Dany sitting by him. He wishes they never went beyond the Wall, but she says she doesn't because \"you have to see it to believe it\". She gives him her word that they (she already thinks of him and her as a team) are going to defeat the Night King and his army. Jon thanks her and nickname her Dany (it's funny, I call her that all the time) and she reminisce the last person who called her that was her psycho brother Viserys who died burning from his Crown of Gold in season 1; so instead he calls her \"my queen\" and tells her he would \"bend the knee, but\u2026\" which is a callback to when injured Ned said the exact same sentence to King Robert in season 1. Jon says his people will come to see Dany for what she really is. Dany then leaves him to rest. So there you have it: Jonaerys is 99.999999% coming true. I for one admit its recent development is solid, however badly I protested it. I don't like Jon bending the knee, however it might be justified by the fact she just risked her life, lost one of her children for the fight, and proved to be an important, powerful and positive ally.It ain't over 'til it's over though!The wights raise Viserion from the water and the Night King turns him into THE ICE DRAGON! Insaneeee!!! Once again the show pulled the rug from underneath us and banged our heads on the floor til we had a concussion. The fact that it is Viserion who will be used as a weapon against Dany- his mother- is intentionally symbolic, since he was named after her deranged brother Viserys. Looking back, the fact the Night King didn't just freeze the water to get to the Dream Team, had the proper weapon to kill a dragon and the chains to lift him out of the water shows that he PLANNED IT. So he is probably a greenseer, the best in the world. This might also explain why the Walkers waited for like five seasons since the Season 2 finale and barely advanced while everybody else teleported like crazy up and down and everywhere (and particularly why they didn't advance in this battle and just frozen the lake before Dany's arrival). Could Bran compete? Can the Night King just fly above the Wall now, or is the sky protected with spells as well?!The episode ends with Viserion's bright blue eye opening wide.\u2026Episode Rating:ACTING \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.5EFFECTS \u2026\u2026\u2026..5PLOT \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..4ENJOYMENT \u2026.5ROUNDUP: \u2026\u2026.4.75\u2026No Cersei, no Jaime, no Bran, no Yara, no Theon, no Bronn, no Euron, no Lyanna, and still, annoyingly, no Ghost... They better be in the finale!I wouldn't say this episode topped the Rains of Castamere AKA the Red Wedding, Hardhome, or the Battle of the Bastards... The action, the interactions of characters and the impact on the story's destiny might be larger than these epic episodes, but the writing, the element of surprise and the dedication to a single plotline, lack here. But it certainly will be remembered as a game-changer, a moment in time where the plot spins 180 degrees. I'd consider forgiving the teleporting, the plot-holes, and the lack of Ghost, because the rest of the episode is brilliantly eventful, action-packed and fateful. The interactions between all our favorite characters, together on screen, were dynamite. The dialogues were (for once this season) very impressive, not George-R.-R.-Martin-good, but I'll take what I can get. Obviously it was the highlight of the entire season, as fans expected.This episode had some of the best visual and sound effects, plot-points and acting in the entire series. This time I praise many actresses and actors because the ensemble cast truly blossomed:Iain Glenn's Jorah shone through the episode and was front and center, having some of the highest number of text and not once but twice close to death (nearly choked then nearly fell off Drogon), and his reaction of sadness to the death of Viserion was even more gut-wrenchingly beautiful than Dany's, his role in the show finally gets focused which I love- and his whole performance on the show is way better than most of his cast mates, to a Shakespearean level really;Richard Dormer's Beric was always brilliant, but this episode not only gives us his awesome fire-sword swinging very best, but his effortless nuanced facial expressions which go from lightly smiling to dead serious and back in mere seconds;Maisie Williams' Arya truly manages to sell her uncontrollable rage at Sansa despite it obviously being a distraction to trap Littlefinger to death;and lastly, Emilia Clarke's Daenerys is in a rare moment of superiority in her range of emotions and performance skills, as she manages to have the simplest and purest reaction of a gut-punch with the death of her child Viserion, be stone-cold towards Tyrion at the beginning of the episode, and completely vulnerable and warm towards Jon at the end.This was easily the most enjoyable episode for me so far this season.Although the plot could've been less predictable and slightly more realistic (for instance not taking dragonglass weapons along was infantile), it has been carefully crafted to invoke intense emotions.As Thrones do best, this pre-finale episode is a heartstopper and a total knockout. All the chess pieces have fallen off the board.So many questions linger (most of which won't be resolved anytime soon presumably):\u2022 Will Arya kill Sansa- or make peace???\u2022 Will Theon save Yara???\u2022 Will Cersei join forces with her enemies??? By any chance will she become the Night Queen???\u2022 Will Jaime sober up, and fulfill his Valonquar prophecy, killing his own child in the process???\u2022 Will Tyrion stay loyal to Dany or eventually change sides???\u2022 Will Brienne choose Jaime or Tormund???\u2022 Will Gendry reunite with Arya???\u2022 Will the Hound fight the Mountain and take revenge???\u2022 Who will Beric resurrect in his final death???\u2022 Will Sam find a useful way to defeat the Night King???\u2022 Will Jorah and Lyanna Mormont ever meet???\u2022 Will Jon be Azor Ahai / the Prince that was Promised / the Last Hero, or Dany???\u2022 Will Bran be revealed as the previous Three-Eyed Raven (the one who trained him), all the historic Brandons or the Night King- and what potentially enormous influence does he have on the history of Westeros???\u2022 What is Varys' endgame???\u2022 Is Missandei a secret spy / traitor- will she betray Dany???\u2022 Will Grey Worm and the Unsullied return to Dany by season's end???\u2022 Will Melisandre's age be addressed???\u2022 Will Littlefinger's manipulations succeed, or will he die soon, probably by Arya or Sansa???\u2022 Will Dany leave the throne aside and fight the only war that matters???\u2022 Will Jon find his dynasty and be the king of the Seven Kingdoms???\u2022 Will the Westerosi people put aside their enmities (as Davos said) to combat the dead in the War for the Dawn???\u2022 Who will be the upper hand, winner of the game, sit the Iron Throne???\u2022 And most importantly- what on Earth did Podrick do to these girls?!?!My heart's racing with anticipation!By the way, though I agree on the sheer ridiculousness of the plan, the inconsistency and continuity issues, the mothefucking absurd time-warping continent-sprinting, and that the season is really a disappointment (as far as Game of Thrones go; it\u2019s still a decent show compared to television standarts)- I still think it is a good hour of television and I personally like it better than episode 4 . While this episode fails to surpass major splendid key episodes of the past, I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying it was a failure. It genuinely is exciting and jaw-dropping (for the most part), and manages to deliver a great experience.", "Don\u2019t be fooled by the following bitching, I still liked the episode.Suicide Squad Westeros style:-Seems that my bets on deaths were on the pessimistic side. Even the unnamed wildlings took a while to be ripped apart.-Lots of nice dialogue among characters.-We\u2019ve seen some troubling timescales, but this is ridiculous. Either they stayed there for a couple weeks without freezing to death somehow or there is a bloody wormhole between the Wall and Dragonstone.-GREAT JOB JON, sure there wasn\u2019t nothing more important at the moment than bashing some bones.-Did we just see a Benjen Ex Machina?Sister drama at Winterfell:Ok, so now Sansa isn\u2019t just creeped by Arya but now she\u2019s terrified.Daenerys is 14:Oh, fucking hell. Here\u2019s how I pictured the scene:.-Daenerys: Ooooh Jon pls dont die. :\u2019(-Jon: Oh hey. Sorry for getting your dragon killed.-Daenerys: It wasnt Drogon so its k.-Jon: Cool. Also Im gonna call you Dany from now on and as soon as I get out of bed Im gonna bend the knee if you know what i mean *wink* *wink*-Dany: *blush*.You\u2019d think she would be at least a bit angry.", "Things don't look good in Sn 7 Episode 6.1:- Icy demonic Night King kills one of Danys' dragon Viserion & resurrects it as a ice breathing dragon under his control.

Predictable, obvious, unrealistic (even by GoT\u2019s standards). So much promise for the episode but so much disappointment.The CGI was incredible, the acting was good. But why the constant one-liners? Took away from a very serious build up to a serious scene, and by the time we got to that scene I had lost a little interest. This pointless dialogue about gay sex, liking dick etc was more like watching an episode of The Inbetweeners than the brilliant GoT. And then we had to struggle through a completely unbelievable and far fetched fight scene, and then we had to deal with the gushy Jon/Dany scene. And dotted in between was an obvious smattering of the Sansa/Arya/Littlefinger storyline which is dry.It left me yearning for Cersei and her bitter, twisted face.Episode 7 - redeem yourself.", "For the first time in the history of Game of Thrones, I was disappointed.After years of realisticly tragic endings where the heros do not prevail against the odds, we are supposed to believe that out of the 6 of the main characters who; venture north of the wall, get surrounded by the army of the undead, and witness a dragon killed, 5 of them survive.Headed into the episode I was sure at least, AT LEAST, 3 of the 6 would perish. But no, for the first time in the realm of the Seven Kingdoms, something unrealistic to the world of Game of Thrones occurred. And I was vastly disappointed.It was a fantastic episode. There where times when I laughed my ass off, and times when I was terrified; and, much like millions of others who will watch on Sunday, was waiting to see who would live and who would die. It delivered blow after blow up until the final credit scroll.But, unfortunately, unrealistically, and downright disappointing, only one minor character died. Everyone else survived, and Game of Thrones damaged its credibility, when it comes to what the show it truly known for.", "Legistically it makes no sense for one as they at least traveled for a day to get to the army of the dead Gendry running back would not make him get to the wall faster humans are endurance creatures and running only gets you somewhere faster if you are within running distance of said destination and depending I how long you can sprint. Gendry has no training at running marathons so I doubt he could keep a sprint for more than 20 minutes. It would take a day to get There. He also passed out upon arrival at the wall so that's another day to wake up and get a message sent. By using the gift on the map as messurement I can determine the distance between watch and dragonstone which is around 6000 miles it would take the raven a month to reach Dany assuming that dragons are say 4 times faster than a raven just to be generous it takes a week for her to reach eastwatch and who knows How long to find them so we have at least 40 days of Jon and friends sitting on a sheet I ice in the cold with nothing to eat and water that is freezing cold and unsafe to Drink as a result. Even assuming that the water was warm enough to drink let's sat Barric heated it with his flaming sword you still have the food problem Jon and crew have low vs reserves meaning that within about 3 to 4 days thier body will consume thier muscle leaving them weak and frail to slowly die in 3 weeks. The only way to survive would be by slowly eating Thoros and even he couldn't feed all 12 of them. Aside from that they had the whites go down in one hit as if they had vital organs the only ones who should have been scoring kills would be Barric Jorrah and Jon. When they fought the white walker they added a new rule that if you kill the white walker who made them then all the undead die. So Jon kills a white walker all to easily and all the undead die exept one conveniently that doesn't attack them. The group killed at least 100 undead with thier weapons Non of the characters died except For Thoros and wildling extras when I was watching the episode I felt no adrenaline past the death of Thoros it was so silly it was almost comical. The Nights king shoots a dragon thousands I feet away instead of the one prone because plot armor when he fires I at Drogon he misses because plot armor. Jon is thrown into a freezing cold lake and stays there long enough for the army to think hes dead and walk away he would have frozen to death. Then the army of the dead Chase him until Benjenxmachina right after Gendryxmachina and Dragonxmachina comes to save him and pointlessly Dies he then somehow doesn't die from hypothermia in his wet cloths and then makes it back.Arya threatens Sansa with the letter she wrote during season 1 that was written obviously under duress which Rob and luin point out immediately making it a very empty threat with no force especially since she colluded with Littlefinger to kill Cercie\u2019s greatest allies. Arya makes cringe lines about her faces and acts as edgy as a final fantasy character. And acts like a psychopath.This episode was a load of steaming garbage", "A great spectacle of dragons, white walkers that rivalled even Michael's Bay most dramatic and explosive-ridden films in sheer visual awe. As a GoT episode though, rather negative as it lacked the political nuance, emotional depth, character development, and realism that were the hallmark of the series exciting and appealing nature. It seems that show now wishes to jump from set-piece to set-piece without consider the underlying impacts and consequences of each plot development. At least we\u2019ll see some sort of conclusions to series though, barring a sudden change in productivity from George R.R Martin.", "There are enough great reviews as it is so I'll keep this succinct:In the stomach-churning scene where Jon & Dany hold hands and she says she'll help cause \u201cnow I see\u201dWell shit fire lady! That's all you had to do to begin with! Really?

How come Daenerys arrive so quickly to save them? Where was the uncle Benjen hiden all this time? What was he eating, ice-cream? Did he really have to sacrifice himself?(a horse can take two people). Why the Dragon didn\u2019t just shoot fire on the King\u2019s Night? (I think Dany had enough time to make a quick turn and melt the ice-man). So many unaswered questions, or maybe I\u2019m just nipticking.The episode wasn\u2019t bad per se. It had some great moments like Daenarys starting to show his flamme towards Jon, the uncertainty of the realtion between the Stark sisters, or \u201cspoilers alert\u201d the perspective of an Ice-Dragon (yeah baby). But to sum up, the episode left me a little bit cold: too much time spent beyond the wall, no big surprise, the manipulation of the sisters by Little finger who nobody knows where he really stands. At least, we have that itty-bitty romance between Jon and Daenerys (if I\u2019m not mistaken). I\u2019ll give that episode 3 ice-spears out of 5.", "I want to like it but I just couldn't I mean it was epic in its actions and I was on the edge of my seat a few times and if it wasn't for the SPOILERS it would have been better.What I did like. The interactions between the characters, the action scenes and the setting.But the plot wasn't good. It was okay but there was a lot of lazy deusdeus ex machinas but I will get to that later.Now the plot. It was stupid for Jon to go out with only a few people. I get the logic in the plan but at the end of the day your going to try and capture one dead body from an army. They just got lucky that they found a scouting party. But I did like that but I wished they actually discussed it, have Jon say the plan is to find a scouting party or something and not just tackle the entire army on.I also feel they could probably do a better job at confirming the dead were coming. Maybe Jaime and Dany respectfully send someone they trust to go out and confirm that yer there is an army of the dead coming.If Jorah went north with Jon looked at the army and came back and said \u201c Yep their is an army of the dead coming and they are big\u201d.The polar bear thing bother me. As cool as it was it made me question one thing. Why don't they have an army of polar bears beyond the wall.The free folk went pass the wall with Jon to avoid this but the animals remained, there wasn't an army of polar bears or wolfs or even dire wolfs passing the wall. I mean there has to be thousands of polar bears pass the wall unless they were hunted to extinction to the point where there was just one left to be killed and turned.Imagine having an army of polar bears or wolfs on your side. So it was cool but it raises questions.Them hiding on that island on the frozen lake scene I didn't like.Couldn't any of the dead have thrown some weapons didn't anyone have a bow and arrow.Couldn't the nights king just throw his spears and finish them off.Maybe be if they found a cave and spent a few days hiding before being caught.what I would have done is have them run across the lake have it break apart on one side but then have the group make it to the other side while the walkers run around. Give Jon group a head start and have them run into a cave system they spend a few days hiding maybe they run into a polar bear this time except a living one which is still pretty dangerous maybe even more because they don't catch fire as easily.They come out on the other side and head to the wall but then they are spotted by the whites and a chase scene happens. We get a scene similar to the Indiana scene where he is being chased and he is running to the plane screaming start the engine.In the show have the group run towards the wall edd, davos or some guard sees them stares for a moment then suddenly the dead come running out of the forest after them.Jon screaming open the gate. Now from the guard point of view they don't hear this but they see him and they open the gate but not fully just enough. They get past the gate and a few whites past the gate and are quickly killed or captured. The gates close and we see a few of the dead blow up as they touch the wood. Now this could have been explained that they can pass the wall it is just they can't touch a part of the wall.Now the deus ex machinas.Dany showing up at the last moment was epic but she got there fast.But the worst is benjen.He shows up and and dies again.This pissed me off he comes back only to die again and we are suppose to feel sad about it. But imagine this from Jon point of view.His uncle who he assumed died years ago shows up puts him on the horse and sends him off and stays behind to die.Jon has to be thinking \u201c what the fuck just happened ! I have so many questions \u201cNow finally I got a lot of walking dead feeling off this some good and bad.The good walking dead feel is when we saw the people getting surrounded and thorn apart.The bad part was the fact only one named character and several background characters died.Game of thrones was known as the show where everyone was at risk so them getting away with only one real death seems off.Now I'm being hypocritical here because when tommen or tomben I forget his proper name was being dragged into the lake I wanted him to be saved I didn't want him to die but at the same time I kind of did because the red priest guy thoros or something I didn't care for him that much and he did kind of die pretty peacefully which is a lot more than what most other dead characters got.The walking dead does this a lot where side characters are killed but main characters mostly get away.Back when they were following the books I feel there was more death but now the show runners are afraid of killing people off. I would probably kill one or 2 more off just to show how dangerous this was.", "Most of the folks here pretty much gave a good review.But lets try to be a little bit realistic here. Not asking for much but seriously about 13 fighters (with fillers) going against thousands of Wights! Its not like these people have super powers.Also Jon bending the damn knee!!!??!? WTF?!?! There was no need, she already said she will help him!Anyways boatsex will surely happen next episode lol, both Jon and Dany are surely have feelings, Dany saw the knife wounds which looks fresh and not a scar!!!", "There is only one true fact about Game of Thrones, it is too vulnerable to SPOILERS.

Littlefinger asks Sansa to use Brienne so that she can reason with Arya. I think he wants to get the girls out of Winterfell and into Cersei's lair. For that to happen, Brienne has to die since she is going to Kings Landing instead of Sansa.Sansa in turn has to die for Arya to get the dagger back. There will be a dying and reunion scene. It will probably be Sansa putting herself in harm's way for Arya. Arya goes through self-realization and becomes a more sober and humble queen. John and Dany die anyway.", "A lot of suprisingly funny dialogue, Sandor Clegane proving that The Hound is truly dead, and Tormund finally calling Clegane on his own BS. Wonderful conversation between the men as they slog northward. Jorah + Thoros, Tormund + Sandor, Jon + Jorah\u2026 alot of character expo in those chats\u2026 and frankly I was shocked Jon didn\u2019t at least lose a hand when he took Clegane\u2019s (pilfered) booze away.As for the action south of the wall\u2026 I sense a Major Character Death at Winterfell soon. Arya must discover the truth about her sister, and I have a feeling she\u2019s going to acquire a new face for just that purpose.Time is a major issue/problem because of several factors\u2026 unless someone figured out how to breed supersonic ravens and Dragon Concords\u2026 but I\u2019m willing to give them poetic license on that.RIP Hound\u2026 You wont be missed.", "It was an episode full of amazingness.But I guess a few of those things were being awaited since the begining of this season , so there was a more of \u201cI knew that was gonna happen \u201d rather than \u201cwait, what? \u201dI think we all expected Danny's reaction to a be a bit more furious / upset after she lost one of her children.But that last shot with blue eyes were stunning. Can't wait for the last episode.", "It was very idiotic move to go north of the wall. I understand why they did it, but Dany could have just killed Cersei easily. I don\u2019t know, I think it was a stupid idea only so Dany could lose a dragon and the NK could get the dragon. Also, no one died but Thoros, totally unrealistic. Someone should have died besides Viserion?", "Those dragon hauling chains in the last scene were the icing on the cake. Can you imagine the forge size needed for making those chains.Also lots of space-time travels. Somehow they have mixed up Game of thrones and Star trek this season.Danny looks gorgeous in white.", "\u201cBeyond The Wall\u201d was a low point in Game of Thrones\u2019 growingly flimsy storytelling. Characters zig-zagging across Westeros at mind-boggling speeds to accelerate certain narratives was just one such frustrating defect. The high quality of writing one has come to expect has deteriorated, resulting in frustrating plot holes and many of the cast behaving out of character. The episode\u2019s crux, the expedition beyond the Wall by several protagonists, was incredibly risky and un-calculated. The show staked too much on its large battles, allowing other aspects to suffer too much.Source: How was GOT's \u201cBeyond the Wall\u201d episode?", "Well, we can only comment on the last and the best scene of the episode, where the dragon opens it\u2019s right (blue) eye.The whole scene reminded us of the time when an American chopper crash-landed in Pakistan in 2011, and the Chinese allegedly reverse-engineered the stealth technology present in it.Here\u2019s your article link: Pakistan let China see crashed U.S. \"stealth\" copterWe will stop as we don\u2019t want to cross the spoiler line, but we hope you see the parallel here :)Fidoc is a medical platform in UAE where users can discover clinics, hospitals and pharmacies.

I wonder what it would feel like to be the Lady of Winterfell.  All I'd need to find out is your face.  Daenerys will win this war.  If you want Cersei to bend the knee,  you can ask her yourself.

Land, livestock, children  Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.  I imagine it was a sad joke at the end.  An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs.  But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread,  it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.  Maybe it still is.  Welcome, my lords.  Your friends arrived before you did.  I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.  A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.  I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.  Supporting the enemy, no less.  - Hard to blame you. - Cersei will anyway.  I'm glad you're alive.  BRONN: Come on!  You can suck his magic cock later.  What's in there?  Fuck off.  I thought you were dead.  Not yet.  You came pretty close.  I was only trying to protect her.  You and me both.  She's alive.  Arya.  - Where? - Winterfell.  Who's protecting her if you're here?  The only one that needs protecting  is the one that gets in her way.  It won't be me.  TYRION: Here we are  the heroes of Blackwater Bay.  Strange place for a reunion.  It is, my lord.  I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick.  Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.  I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours  if she ends up on the throne.  You've been thinking about our new queen?  Perhaps you've been reconsidering your allegiances.  Remember my offer  whatever they're paying you, I'll pay double.  And that would be double what now, exactly?  Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right.  - Looking after myself. - TYRION: Are you?  Helping me to arrange this meeting  wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it?  You put yourself at risk.  I put yourself at risk. Important difference.  It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine.  Now, thanks to me,  she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door.  She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired  of the clever words that pour out their pieholes.  All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.  If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.  It's good to see you again.  Yeah, you, too.  Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.  Come on, Pod.  Let's you and me go have a drink  while the fancy folks talk, eh?  I left this shit city  because I didn't want to die in it.  Am I going to die in this shit city?  You might.  And this is all your idea.  Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.  And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)  Remember me?  Yeah, you do.  You're even fucking uglier than I am now.  What did they do to you?  Doesn't matter.  That's not how it ends for you, brother.  You know who's coming for you.  You've always known.  Where is she?  She'll be here soon.  Didn't travel with you?  No.  (DRAGONS SCREECHING)  - (SCREECHING) - (WINGS FLAPPING)  (ROARING)  (ROARING)  We've been here for some time.  My apologies.

You're the smallest concern here.  Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?  His wasn't even good.  He explained it at the end.  Never explain. It always ruins it.  We don't even let your kind live  in the Iron Islands, you know?  We kill you at birth.  An act of mercy for the parents.  Perhaps you ought to sit down.  Why?  Sit down or leave.  (LAUGHING)  We are a group of people who do not like one another,  as this recent demonstration has shown.  We have suffered at each other's hands.  We have lost people we love at each other's hands.  If all we wanted was more of the same,  there would be no need for this gathering.  We are entirely capable of waging war against each other  without meeting face-to-face.  So instead, we should settle our differences  and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?  We all know that will never happen.  Then why are we here?  This isn't about living in harmony.  It's just about living.  The same thing is coming for all of us.  A general you can't negotiate with.  An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield.  Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city.  They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.  I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.  This is serious.  I wouldn't be here if it weren't.  I don't think it's serious at all.  I think it's another bad joke.  If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly,  you're asking me for a truce.  Yes. That's all.  That's all?  Pull back my armies and stand down  while you go on your monster hunt.  Or while you solidify and expand your position.  Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back  until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.  Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with.  You have my word.  The word of a would-be usurper.  There is no conversation  that will erase the last 50 years.  We have something to show you.  (CHAINS RATTLING)  (BOX THUDS)  (SCREECHING)  (GRUNTS)  (SCREECHING)  We can destroy them by burning them.  (SCREECHING)  And we can destroy them with dragonglass.  If we don't win this fight,  then that is the fate of every person in the world.  (GRUNTS)  There is only one war that matters  the Great War.  And it is here.  DAENERYS: I didn't believe it until I saw them.  I saw them all.  How many?  A hundred thousand, at least.  Can they swim?  No.  Good.  I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.  What are you talking about?  I've been around the world.  I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine,  and this  this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.  I'm going back to my island.  You should go back to yours.  When winter's over,  we'll be the only ones left alive.  CERSEI: He's right to be afraid.  And a coward to run.  If those things come for us,  there will be no kingdoms to rule.  Everything we suffered will have been for nothing.  Everything we lost will have been for nothing.  The crown accepts your truce.  Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.  (SIGHS)  In return, the King in the North will extend this truce.  He will remain in the North where he belongs.  He will not take up arms against the Lannisters.  He will not choose sides.  DAENERYS: Just the King in the North?  - Not me? - (CERSEI CHUCKLES)  I would never ask it of you.  You would never agree to it.  And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now.  I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.  I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word.  I am true to my word.  Or I try to be.  That is why I cannot give you what you ask.  I cannot serve two queens.  And I have already pledged myself  to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.  Then there is nothing left to discuss.  The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them.  We will deal with whatever is left of you.  BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.  It's been good to see you.  I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.  We both saw what just happened.  We both saw that thing.  Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them.  But I'm loyal to the queen,  and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.  Oh, fuck loyalty!  Fuck loyalty?  This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths.  Talk to the queen.  And tell her what?  DAVOS: I wish you hadn't done that.  I'm grateful for your loyalty,  but my dragon died so that we could be here.  If it's all for nothing,  then he died for nothing.  I know!  I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen.  I would have advised it, had you asked.  But have you ever considered  learning how to lie every now and then?  Just a bit?  I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold.  Talk about my father if you want,  tell me that's the attitude that got him killed.  But when enough people make false promises,  words stop meaning anything.  Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies.  And lies won't help us in this fight.  TYRION: That is indeed a problem.  The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.  Any ideas as to how we might  change that state of affairs?  Only one.  Everyone stays here,  and I go and talk to my sister.  I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.  I don't want Cersei to murder me either.  I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.  JON: I did this.  - I should go. - She'll definitely murder you.  I go see my sister alone.  Or we all go home  and we're right back where we started.  - You spoke with her? - At her until she kicked me out.  She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.  A lot of people seem to think that, actually.  I'm about to step into a room  with the most murderous woman in the world  who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of.  Who's an idiot?  I suppose we should say goodbye,  one idiot to another.  I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.  She's your kind of woman  a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.  A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate.  That must be difficult for you.  So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  - whom you've convinced to bow down before her. - I didn't know about that.  And now you've got them both working towards the same goal,  the goal you've worked towards your entire life  - Cersei, I didn't know. - the destruction of this family.  I am the one preventing that from happening.  Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate.  She didn't want to bring you words.  She wanted to bring you fire and blood  until I advised her otherwise.  I don't want to destroy our family.  I never have.  You killed our father.  After he sentenced me to death  for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him.  Hate me for it if you want.  I hate myself for it in spite of what he was,  in spite of what he did to me.  Oh, poor little man.  Your papa was mean to you.  Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow?  You left us open.  You laid us bare for the vultures,  and the vultures came and tore us apart.  You may not have killed Joffrey,  but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen.  No one would've touched them if Father was here.  - No one would have dared - I have never been more sorry about anything.  I will not hear it, not from you.  I will not hear it!  All right.  You love your family,  and I have destroyed it.  I will always be a threat.  So put an end to me.  If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother.  If it weren't for me, you'd have a father.  If it weren't for me,  you'd have two beautiful children.  I've thought about killing you  more times than I can count.  Do it! Say the word.  (SIGHS)  (PANTS)  I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.  - I will not - I don't care. I loved them.  You know I did.  You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.  It doesn't matter.  Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter.  I don't care why you did what you did.  I only care what it cost us.  It cost us our future.  If there's no future, then why are we here?  Why did you allow me to come?  Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.  Yes, no, not what you hoped for,  but you must have hoped for something.  What did you hope for?  - To make Jon Snow submit to your queen? - Mm, not like this.  But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.  - Yes. - Why?  Because I think  she will make the world a better place.  You said she'd destroy King's Landing.  She knows herself.  She chose an advisor  who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.  That's the difference between you.  I don't care about checking my worst impulses.  I don't care about making the world a better place.  Hang the world.  That thing you dragged here,  I know what it is, I know what it means.  And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world.  Not at all.  As soon as it opened its mouth,  the world disappeared for me,  right down its black throat.  All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth  away from the ones who matter most,  away from my family.  Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea.  Get on a boat, take those who matter  You're pregnant.  (SIGHS)  No one is less happy about this than I am.  I know.  I respect what you did.  Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.  This place was the beginning of the end for my family.  (SPEAKING VALYRIAN)  A dragon is not a slave.  They were terrifying.  Extraordinary.  They filled people with wonder and awe,  and we locked them in here.  They wasted away.  They grew small.  And we grew small as well.  We weren't extraordinary without them.  We were just like everyone else.  You're not like everyone else.  And your family hasn't seen its end.  You're still here.  I can't have children.  Who told you that?  The witch who murdered my husband.  Has it occurred to you she might not have been  a reliable source of information?  You were right from the beginning.  If I had trusted you, everything would be different.  So, what now?  I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall.  And I can't pretend that Cersei  won't take back half the country the moment I march north.  It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct.  We're fucked.  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)  My armies will not stand down.  I will not pull them back to the capital.  I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War.  The darkness is coming for us all.  We'll face it together.  And when the Great War is over,  perhaps you'll remember I chose to help  with no promises or assurances from any of you.  I expect not.  Call our banners.  All of them.  - (WIND HOWLING) - (CAWING)  LITTLEFINGER: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms.  Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.  No, this is the way he is,  the way he's always been.  He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?  I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.  This is his writing, his signature.  He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen.  He's bent the knee.  I've heard gossip  that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.  What does that have to do with anything?  Jon is young and unmarried.  Daenerys is young and unmarried.  You think he wants to marry her?  An alliance makes sense.  Together, they'd be difficult to defeat.  He was named King in the North.  He can be unnamed.  Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along.  She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me,  and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.  You are family, too.  Would Arya really murder her own sister?  Do you know what she is now?  Do you know what the Faceless Men are?  Only by reputation.  They worship the God of Death, I believe.  I never trust godly men.  They're killers.  And Arya was one of them.  What do you think she's after?  She's your sister.  You know her far better than I ever could.  Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives,  I play a little game.  I assume the worst.  What's the worst reason they could possibly have  for saying what they say and doing what they do?  Then I ask myself,  \"How well does that reason explain  what they say and what they do?\"  So, tell me  what's the worst thing she could want?  She could want me dead  because she thinks I wronged my family.  Why did she come to Winterfell?  To kill me  for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.  Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?  To provide proof of my betrayals.  To provide justification after she murders me.  And after she murders you,  what does she become?  Lady of Winterfell.  (WAVES CRASHING)  If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad,  they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.  And the Unsullied?  We can sail with them to White Harbor,  meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad,  then ride together to Winterfell.  Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace.  You have many enemies in the North.  Thousands fell fighting your father.  All it takes is one angry man with a crossbow.  He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad  and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero.  The man who killed the conqueror.  JON: It's your decision, Your Grace.  But if we're going to be allies in this war,  it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies.  If we sail to White Harbor together,  I think it sends a better message.  I've not come to conquer the North.  I'm coming to save the North.  We sail together.  Jon.  Can I speak with you?  All right.  What you did in King's Landing,  what you said  you could've lied to Cersei  about bending the knee to Daenerys.  You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.  We went down there to make peace.  And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other  if we're going to fight together.  You've always known what was right.  Even when we were all young and stupid,  you always knew.  Every step you take  it's always the right step.  It's not.  It may seem that way from the outside,  but I promise you, it's not true.  I've done plenty of things that I regret.  Not compared to me, you haven't.  No.  Not compared to you.  I always wanted to do the right thing.  Be the right kind of person.  But I never knew what that meant.  It always seemed like there's  like there was an impossible choice I had to make.  Stark or Greyjoy.  Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.  - He was. - And you betrayed him.  Betrayed his memory.  I did.  (SIGHS)  But you never lost him.  He's a part of you.  Just like he's a part of me.  But the things I've done  It's not my place to forgive you for all of it.  But what I can forgive,  I do.  You don't need to choose.  You're a Greyjoy  and you're a Stark.  When I was Ramsay's prisoner,  Yara tried to save me.  She's the only one  who tried to save me.  (SNIFFLES)  She needs me now.  So, why are you still talking to me?  HARRAG: Load up.  Load up, lads. Go on.  - (CHATTER) - Tide's coming in.  All of us chose to follow Yara.  We left the Iron Islands for Yara.  She would never leave one of us behind.  We're not leaving her behind.  Your sister's dead.  - She's not dead. - She's dead.  Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.  - She's our queen. - She's your sister, and you left her to die.  I did.  I ran from my uncle.  I was a coward.  So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you?  They say the dead can't swim.  We're going to sail east,  find a nice, quiet island,  kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.  - We're done with all that. - Who says we are?  Yara did. She made a pledge.  We're going to find her,  and we're going to set her free.  - (SPITS) - (MEN LAUGH)  Run away, little Theon.  It's what you do best.  MAN: He needs to shut his mouth.  (MEN CHEERING)  - MAN: Hey! - (MEN LAUGHING)  - (SHOUTS) - MAN #2: Oh, yes!  - MAN #3: That's more like it. - (MEN LAUGHING)  (GRUNTS)  Stay down  or I'll kill you!  (GRUNTS)  I said stay down or I'll kill you!  (SHOUTING)  (GRUNTING)  (GRUNTS)  (SHOUTS)  (GRUNTING)  (PANTS)  Not for me.  For Yara!  MEN: Yara!  Have my sister brought to the Great Hall.  Are you sure you want to do this?  It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.  And what does honor demand?  That I defend my family from those who would harm us.  That I defend the North from those who would betray us.  All right, then.  Get on with it.  You stand accused of murder.  You stand accused of treason.  How do you answer these charges  Lord Baelish?  My sister asked you a question.  Lady Sansa, forgive me  I'm a bit confused.  Which charges confuse you?  Let's start with the simplest one  you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.  You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall.  Do you deny it?  I did it to protect you.  You did it to take power in the Vale.  Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn.  You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him.  Do you deny it?  Whatever your aunt might have told you  she was a troubled woman.  She imagined enemies everywhere.  You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents  telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn  when, really, it was you.  The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters,  it was you who started it.  Do you deny it?  I know of no such letter.  You conspired with Cersei Lannister  and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark.  Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned  and later executed on false charges of treason.  - Do you deny it? - I deny it!  None of you were there to see what happened.  None of you knows the truth.  You held a knife to his throat.  You said, \"I did warn you not the trust me.\"  You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister.  But that was another one of your lies.  It was yours.  Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl.  - I've protected you. - Protected me?  By selling me to the Boltons?  If we could speak alone,  I can explain everything.  Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives,  I play a little game.  I assume the worst.  What's the worst reason you have  for turning me against my sister?  That's what you do, isn't it?  That's what you've always done  turn family against family,  turn sister against sister.  That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa,  and that's what you tried to do to us.  Sansa, please.  I'm a slow learner, it's true.  But I learn.  Give me a chance to defend myself.  I deserve that.  I am Lord Protector of the Vale  and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.  I think not.  Sansa, I beg you!  I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.  And yet, you betrayed her.  I loved you.  More than anyone.  And yet, you betrayed me.  When you brought me back to Winterfell,  you told me there's no justice in the world,  not unless we make it.  Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish.  I will never forget them.  Sansa!  (GASPS)  I  JAIME: Our men in King's Landing  will march north in three days' time.  MAN: It'll take us a fortnight  just to gather supplies for the train.  JAIME: We don't have a fortnight.  If the North falls, we fall. Three days.  The remaining forces in the Westerlands  will take the river road east.  We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town  and march together to Winterfell.  Ser Jaime.  Your Grace.  My lords, I need a moment with my brother.  MEN: Your Grace.  - What are you doing? - Preparing the expedition north.  Expedition north?  I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister.  The Starks and Targaryens have united against us,  and you want to fight alongside them?  Are you a traitor or an idiot?  You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy  I'll say whatever I need to say  to ensure the survival of our house.  You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father?  You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum,  to fight for the Dragon Queen?  You saw it with your own eyes.  You saw a dead man trying to kill us.  I saw it burn.  If dragons can't stop them,  if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them,  how will our armies make a difference?  This isn't about noble houses,  this is about the living and the dead!  And I intend to stay amongst the living.  Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North.  We stay here where we've always been.  I made a promise.  Our child will rule Westeros.  Our child will never be born if the dead come south.  The monsters are real.  The white walkers,  the dragons, the Dothraki screamers  all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real.  So be it.  Let the monsters kill each other.  And while they battle in the North,  we take back the lands that belong to us.  - And then what? - And then we rule.  When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins.  You understand that, don't you?  If the dead win, they march south and kill us all.  If the living win, and we've betrayed them,  they march south and kill us all!  The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all.  Most of them will die in the North.  I faced them in the field.  We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.  How many dragons did you see at the pit?  - Two. - What happened to the third?  For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!  She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied.  She came here to show us all her power.  No, something happened. The dragons are vulnerable.  We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers.  We don't have the support of the other houses!  No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank.  You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold.  Oh, I know it's boring for you.  You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight.  But I listened, I learned.  Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos  the Golden Company.  20,000 men, horses, elephants, I believe.  The Golden Company is not here.  They're in Essos.  How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?  Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail  and sailed back to the Iron Islands?  Do you think he abandoned  the chance to marry the queen?  No one walks away from me.  He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.  He's going to ferry the Golden Company back here  to help us win the war for Westeros.  You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me,  the commander of your armies?  And you conspired with Tyrion,  the man who murdered our father,  without telling me, your queen.  I didn't conspire with him.  You met with him in secret without my consent.  You planned to promote my enemies' interests.  That is the definition of conspiracy.  I pledged to ride north.  I intend to honor that pledge.  - And that will be treason. - Treason?  Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies.  What would you call it?  Doesn't matter what I'd call it.  I told you no one walks away from me.  Are you going to order him to kill me?  I'm the only one you have left.  Our children are gone, our father is gone.  It's just me and you now.  There's one more yet to come.  Give the order, then.  I don't believe you.  (CHATTER)  - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Come in.  Samwell Tarly.  I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.  I remember everything.  (DOOR CLOSES)  You helped us get beyond the Wall.  - You're a good man. - Oh, well, thank you,  but, um, I'm not sure that I am.  What happened to you beyond the Wall?  I became the Three-Eyed Raven.  Oh!  I don't know what that means.  I can see things that happened in the past.  I can see things happening now  all over the world.  Why did you come to Winterfell?  Um  Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead.  I know he is.  But he can't do it alone,  so I've come here to help him.  He's on his way back to Winterfell  with Daenerys Targaryen.  You you saw this in  in a vision?  Oh.  He needs to know the truth.  The truth about what?  About himself.  No one knows. No one but me.  Jon isn't really my father's son.  He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.  He was born in a tower in Dorne.  His last name isn't really Snow,  it's Sand.  It's not.  Dornish bastards are named Sand.  At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary.  He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.  He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.  Are you certain?  It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary.  I don't know why he'd lie.  Is this something you can see?  Rhaegar and Lyanna: Father, Smith, Warrior,  Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.  - I am hers and she is mine - I am his and he is mine  from this day until the end of my days.  BRAN'S VOICE: Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie.  Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt or rape her.  He loved her.  And she loved him.  - BRAN'S VOICE: And Jon - (BABY CRYING)  Jon's real name  His name is Aegon Targaryen.  You have to protect him.  Promise me, Ned.  (PANTING)  BRAN'S VOICE: He's never been a bastard.  (PANTING)  BRAN'S VOICE: He's the heir to the Iron Throne.  BRAN'S VOICE: He needs to know.  We need to tell him.  Are you all right?  It's just strange.  In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.  You did the right thing.  You did it.  I'm just the executioner.  You passed the sentence.  You're the Lady of Winterfell.  Does that bother you?  I was never going to be as good a lady as you.  So I had to be something else.  I never could have survived what you survived.  You would have.  You're the strongest person I know.  I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.  Well, don't get used to it.  You're still very strange and annoying.  \"In winter, we must protect ourselves.  Look after one another.\"  Father.  \"When the snows fall and the white winds blow,  the lone wolf dies,  but the pack survives.\"  I miss him.  Me, too.  (BIRDS CAWING)  (CHATTER)  BERIC: It's a long way down.  Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.  MAN: I can see movement  Watch, on the tree line!  MAN #2: What is it?

Sansa questions loyalties.   Summary In King's Landing 707 Bronn Jaime Lannister Bronn and Jaime discuss Daenerys's forces.  The Unsullied, led by a grim-faced Grey Worm, line up in tight formation outside the walls of King's Landing. On the walls, Jaime Lannister and Bronn discuss how the latter is unnerved by the idea of soldiers without genitalia, as he's been around enough soldiers to know why they fight, and that the idea of soldiers who fight for no promise of sex is alien to him. As they talk, hordes of Dothraki ride in, a stark contrast to the disciplined Unsullied who don't even blink as hundreds of horses flood past them; but the two ancient enemies are united in cause today.  At the harbor, Tyrion Lannister, Varys, Missandei, Jon Snow and Davos Seaworth nervously sail past Euron Greyjoy's fleet. Sandor Clegane goes below decks to check on their \"guest,\" who is thankfully just as riled up as ever. In her solar, Cersei is informed by Qyburn of the arrival of Daenerys's party, though there is no sign of Daenerys herself. Cersei promptly tells Gregor Clegane that if anything goes wrong at the summit, he is to kill Daenerys, Tyrion and Jon in that order, then dispose of the rest as he pleases.  The group arrives and are escorted to the Dragonpit, the location of the summit. Tyrion reconnects with Bronn, who concedes it is good to see him again. The pair greet Podrick Payne, who had arrived earlier with Brienne of Tarth. As Pod goes off with Bronn, Brienne hangs back to talk with Sandor. They both acknowledge that they only fought to protect Arya, and she tells him that Arya doesn't need looking out for anymore; rather, he should reserve his concern for whoever is unfortunate or stupid enough to stand in her way, which seems to amuse him.  At the Dragonpit, the various factions meet: Cersei Lannister, Jaime, Qyburn and Euron representing the Iron Throne, Jon, Davos and Brienne representing the North, and Daenerys's court. When Cersei demands to know where her rival is, the Dragon Queen makes a suitably dramatic entrance on Drogon's back, with Rhaegal flying overhead. Sandor, for the first time in years, comes face-to-helmet with his brother Gregor, and wonders what exactly has happened to him, before leaving to retrieve the captured wight. Sandor ultimately muses however that what happened to Gregor is irrelevant, and promises what's left of his brother that he still intends to end Gregor. Euron tries to posture, threatening to kill Yara unless Theon yields to him and deriding Tyrion's dwarfism; when Tyrion and Theon retort to his taunts with their own, Euron remarks that Tyrion would have been killed at birth in the Iron Islands. A furious Jaime orders Euron to sit down, and when he disregards the warning, Cersei reiterates it; a subdued Euron returns to his seat.  The Dragon and the Wolf Tyrion and Jon Jon and Tyrion explain the Great War.  Getting the meeting on track, Tyrion and Jon attempt to convince the Lannister queen of the greater threat coming for them all; according to Tyrion, one million people all live crammed together in the city. They will soon become one million more soldiers in the army of the dead. Cersei callously responds that it will likely be an improvement for most of them, her flippancy noticeably angering the normally stoic Jon. Cersei refuses to believe the claims, dismissing this as a ploy to trick her into lowering her defenses. To prove their claims, Sandor returns with the crate containing the wight, which is worryingly silent. Sandor gets the crate open and is visibly frightened by what he sees inside it, which worries Jaime since he knows the Hound is not afraid of anything, while Cersei watches the proceedings with a dismissively smug smirk. Sandor finally gives the crate a massive kick and knocks it over; the enraged wight promptly clambers out and charges toward the nearest target - Cersei, appropriately enough. Completely stunned at the sight of the undead creature throwing itself towards them, the Lannister queen and her allies recoil in horror as Sandor pulls the screeching monster back on a chain, its claws inches from Cersei's face, and manages to slice the creature in half when it turns to attack him. The Stark and Targaryen delegations watch it emotionlessly but the Lannisters look on in shock as the wight's upper half still moves around shrieking and snarling, trying to crawl towards Sandor, who slices off one of its outstretched hands. After a clearly fascinated Qyburn briefly examines it, Jon steps forward and takes the wight's severed hand, using a torch provided by Davos to demonstrate how fire can be used to stop them. He then uses a dragonglass dagger to the heart to end the wight's upper half, bluntly stating that if they don't win the coming war, such a fate awaits every person in Westeros, insisting that all their other conflicts pale in comparison to the Great War. Daenerys, who has watched the whole thing poker-faced, supplies that she didn't believe it herself until she saw them all personally. A horror-struck Jaime asks how many wights are coming, and Daenerys tells him the army of the dead numbers at least 100,000. Euron asks if the wights can swim. When Jon responds, \"No,\" Euron announces to Cersei his intention to withdraw the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Isles. He declares that he has been over the whole world and has never been terrified until now. On his way out, he tells Daenerys to retreat to her island while he returns to his own, and to come find him when they are the only two left alive.  Seemingly convinced, Cersei immediately offers terms: satisfied that Daenerys is concerned with the army of the dead, Cersei will not withdraw her troops, but will guarantee that they will not hinder the Targaryen or Northern forces in any way during the battle against the White Walkers. She refuses to deal with Daenerys at all, however, and calls on Jon Snow, as King in the North and Ned Stark's son, to keep the truce and to stay out of any future conflict between Cersei and Daenerys. Jon, however, says that he cannot serve two queens - and reveals to all assembled that he has already declared for Daenerys, infuriating all three Lannisters present. Declaring that there will be no truce if it is just her and Daenerys, Cersei storms out, content to let the Starks and Targaryens battle the undead alone and then deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict. Desperate, Brienne grabs Jaime and begs him to reconsider, as what they've seen goes beyond such petty reasons as Houses, honor and thrones. Jaime doesn't disagree, but walks away, not knowing what he can say to convince his sister.  Meanwhile, Daenerys and Tyrion (who never knew about Jon's change of heart in the first place) criticize Jon over declaring his allegiance in public. Tyrion suggests that learning to lie just a little might be a good skill, while Daenerys points out that if they leave without an alliance, everything they've sacrificed, including Viserion's death, will be made worthless. Jon responds that while scrupulous honesty may or may not have contributed to getting his father killed, if no one is willing to speak the truth, then everyone's word is worthless, and lies will not help them win the coming fight. Tyrion reluctantly decides that he will go and try to talk some reason into Cersei alone. Daenerys and Jon protest, fearing Cersei may have him killed out of spite, but Tyrion insists it's the only way if they don't want everything they've done to be for nothing and bids them wait.  In the Red Keep, Tyrion, escorted by Ser Gregor, meets Jaime, who confirms that he believes the threat of the dead, but has been unable to convince Cersei. He only accomplished talking at her until she threw him out of her office. Tyrion enters Cersei's office, and the two trade savage barbs, Cersei blaming his murder of Tywin for the series of events that led to her younger children's deaths and the destruction of House Lannister's future. Tyrion maintains that Tywin deserved to die for both the years of abuse he inflicted on Tyrion and for trying to execute Tyrion on false charges, as well as insisting he loved Myrcella Baratheon and Tommen Baratheon almost as much as Cersei and that he regrets what happened to them. He attempts to call Cersei's bluff, claiming that if Cersei genuinely blamed him for their deaths, then Gregor should just kill him right then and there. A tense moment passes, but Cersei refrains from giving the order. Relieved, Tyrion heads straight for the wine. They continue their discussion; Cersei angrily accuses Tyrion of plotting to bring down House Lannister with the help of Jon and Daenerys. Tyrion loses patience, retorting that he didn't know Jon had sworn allegiance to Daenerys and that without his intervention, Daenerys would have razed the Red Keep to the ground with everyone inside it. When Cersei questions why Tyrion stopped her, he replies that he believes she will make the world a better place, and that he serves Daenerys to curb her excesses, unlike Cersei, who freely indulges her worst impulses. She retorts that her only interest is protecting those she cares about, musing if Euron didn't have the right idea to flee somewhere safe with those who matter, at which Tyrion realizes that Cersei is pregnant.  Jon and Dany 707 Daenerys and Jon discuss Viserion's death.  Back at the Dragonpit, Daenerys and Jon discuss the dragons and how her ancestors caged them, and in turn become less impressive as the power of the dragons waned. Jon questions Daenerys's assertion of infertility, particularly when she admits that she never got an informed opinion about her condition from anyone except Mirri Maz Duur herself. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of all three Lannisters. Cersei has agreed to work with Daenerys, but not by keeping her troops back: the Lannister army will march north to fight alongside the Starks and Targaryens.  The Dragon and the Wolf Cersei Cersei reveals her intentions to Jaime.  After the enemy delegation has left, an eager and relieved Jaime meets with his commanders to discuss the logistics of moving the army north. Cersei enters the map room and asks what he is doing. Dismissing the commanders, she tells Jaime he really is the stupidest Lannister. Shocked, Jaime listens as Cersei explains that Euron has not abandoned her, but has gone to Essos to ferry the Golden Company back to Westeros. She intentionally leaked her pregnancy to Tyrion so he would believe her, and now she intends to allow their enemies to exhaust themselves against the army of the dead, then have the Golden Company clean up what's left of whoever wins in the North. Jaime is furious that his sister and Euron plotted this behind his back, but Cersei angrily accuses him of plotting with Tyrion in favor of her enemies. Reeling from the accusation, Jaime incredulously reminds her that someone is going to win the battle in the North regardless and come south afterwards: if the dead win, their numbers will be strengthened by the casualties and they will kill all without pause, compunction or mercy; if the living win, the realm will know Cersei left them all to die and will march south to settle the score. Cersei, however, is indifferent. Finally seeing his sister for the power-mad narcissist she truly is, Olenna Tyrell's warnings ringing in his ears, Jaime disgustedly declares that he, at least, will fight to honor the pledge he made. When he tries to leave, he finds his way blocked by Ser Gregor. Cersei furiously insists that she will kill him as a traitor if he tries to leave, but Jaime calls her bluff and storms out, and Cersei does not give the order.  Alone, Jaime rides out of King's Landing, having discarded his Lannister armour in favour of rougher and less recognisable travelling garb. Realizing how conspicuous he is, he nervously pulls a glove over his golden hand. Surprised by the sudden appearance of a drop of water on the glove, Jaime looks up and sees snow begin to fall from the grey sky, carried by a chill wind. As Jaime rides away, the snow begins to cover King's Landing in its entirety; the streets, the houses, the ruins where the Great Sept once stood, the little skulls in the Dragonpit and even Cersei's map in the Red Keep.  Winter has come at last for the south.  At Winterfell Sansa Stark discusses the potential threat of her sister Arya Stark with Petyr Baelish. Baelish tries to manipulate her as usual, encouraging her to think as he does. He tells Sansa to ask herself what Arya's worst possible motivation is. Seemingly overcome with horror at the thought that Arya would want to take her place and reign as Lady of Winterfell, it seems that Sansa decides to do something about it, to Baelish's quiet delight.  Arya the dragon and the wolf s7 1 The Starks stage Littlefinger's trial.  After a long time reflecting on her course of action on the battlements, Sansa orders Arya be brought to the great hall. In the Hall, Sansa and Bran are seated at the great table, the hall lined with Stark and Arryn men and a few key lords such as Yohn Royce and, of course, Baelish who is watching the whole thing with a malicious little smile. Arya is brought in and asks Sansa if she \"really wants to do this.\" Sansa replies it's not about what she wants, it's about justice. She proceeds to rattle off a list of crimes perpetrated against House Stark... and asks Baelish how he intends to answer the charges. At this, all eyes turn towards Baelish. Thrown, Littlefinger tries to figure out what is going on. Sansa reveals his murder of Lysa Arryn and his use of Lysa to murder Jon Arryn. She uses his own words against him and accuses him (quite correctly) of orchestrating the conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters that has ultimately engulfed the Seven Kingdoms for the better part of the last decade, including the betrayal and death of her father Eddard Stark.  Execution of petyr s7 Arya makes another step avenging her family, killing Littlefinger.  Baelish tries to deny this, but Bran uses his Greensight to recall the exact words Baelish said as he held the knife to Ned's throat. Swiftly realizing that he has lost control of the situation and the trial is just a drumhead, Baelish demands that Lord Royce take him, the Lord Protector of the Vale, to safety; Bronze Yohn refuses him with the words \"I think not\". In desperation, Baelish falls to his knees and pleads for his life, insisting yet again how much he loved Cat and how much he now loves Sansa, but Sansa, unswayed by his pleadings, sentences him to death and promises she will never forget all the lessons he taught her, sharing a look with Arya. As Baelish tries to speak, Arya walks up and slits his throat with the same Valyrian steel dagger that lay at the heart of his plots. Littlefinger bleeds out and slumps dead to the floor, the Northern and Vale men and women watching dispassionately. At long last, the War of the Five Kings is ended and justice meted out on the one responsbible.  On the battlements, Sansa and Arya discuss Littlefinger's plots and how much they, as people, have changed. Arya tells Sansa that she wouldn't have been able to survive what Sansa did. Sansa disagrees, saying Arya is the strongest person she knows. The sisters muse on another of their father's sayings about how lone wolves die in the winter, but wolf packs survive. They realize the truth of his words as their remaining family needs to stick together.  Rhaegar and Lyanna 707 Bran's vision of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.  Sometime later, Samwell Tarly and Gilly arrive at Winterfell. Upon hearing that Bran is back, Sam calls on him, recalling their meeting at the Nightfort some years earlier. Bran is glad to see Sam, but is surprised to find him here. When Sam reiterates his loyalty to Jon, Bran, unable to keep it a secret any longer, reveals the truth of Jon's origins: he was born to Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark at a Tower in Dorne, and is not a Snow at all, but a Sand. Sam realizes that that isn't true either, recalling the entry from High Septon Maynard's private journal about annulling Rhaegar's marriage. Bran expressed his doubts, but Sam reiterates the private nature of the journal and encourages Bran to use Greensight to confirm it. To his own surprise, Bran easily finds the wedding, where he sees a clearly happy Lyanna wedding Rhaegar in a Faith of the Seven ceremony before a Heart tree. Warging forward to the Tower of Joy, Bran finally hears Lyanna's dying words. Now piecing the truth together, Bran declares that Rhaegar never raped Lyanna. She loved him and ran off with him, and bore him a son: Aegon Targaryen. His voice breaks a little as he realizes that Robert's Rebellion, the deaths of his grandfather and uncle, and the entire reign of House Baratheon of King's Landing was all for nothing and built on a lie... And his cousin raised as his illegitimate brother is, and always has been, the heir to the Iron Throne.  In the Narrow Sea In the Chamber of the Painted Table, Daenerys and her court discuss logistics. It will take the Dothraki a fortnight to reach Winterfell, and the plan is to have Jon and the Unsullied cross the sea by ship and meet them at White Harbor. Jorah Mormont points out that the North is not really safer for her than anywhere else, as someone with a memory of Robert's Rebellion and an idea of becoming a hero could easily take her out with a single crossbow bolt. He suggests she fly to Winterfell to avoid any potential unpleasantness. Jon counters that Daenerys ride with them so that the North can see her as a liberator and ally. After a moment's consideration, Daenerys decides to sail to Winterfell with Jon. Jorah, suspecting a different reason for her decision, throws her a look, which she notices but avoids.  After the meeting, Theon talks privately with Jon. He tells Jon that, even when they were growing up at Winterfell, Jon always seemed to know the right thing to do. Jon explains he has made mistakes and has done things he regrets. Theon replies, \"Not compared to me, you haven't,\" and confides that he has always felt torn between his Greyjoy heritage and his Stark upbringing, tried to do the right thing, but was uncertain about the right step to take. Jon is angry about Theon's betrayal against (Jon's) family and tells him that their father, Ned Stark, was more a father to Theon than Balon Greyjoy ever was. However, Jon relents and tells Theon that he never lost Ned, Ned is part of both of them, and Theon is both a Greyjoy and a Stark. He says he can forgive Theon for what is in his power to forgive. Theon confides that when he was Ramsay's prisoner, his sister Yara tried to save him and he needs to save her now. Jon encourages him to save Yara.  Theon fights s7 finale Theon fights for the loyalty of his crew.  Theon returns to the remaining Ironborn who continue to regard him with disgust. Theon tells his men that Euron has his sister and that they must go back for her. Harrag shuts Theon down, declaring him a coward, and proclaims that they are going to go where they can rape and pillage as they usually do. Theon reminds them that Yara has forbidden their old ways, but Harrag threatens Theon and begins to assault him, telling him to stay down. Although he is knocked down, Theon barely reacts to the blows, as he has experienced far greater pain at the hands of Ramsay Bolton. He gets up to attack, but Harrag continues to beat Theon, again insisting he stay or he will kill him. Theon once more defies him, and attacks Harrag who grabs Theon, and kicks him several times in the crotch. However, as Ramsay had previously castrated Theon, there are no testicles for Harrag to injure. Theon smiles as he gets the upper hand, smashing the captain's face practically to a pulp, and beating him into submission. The other ironborn finally relent, accepting Theon and his mission. As they prepare to set sail, Theon wades into the sea to wash his wounds in salt water, embracing his identity as an ironborn.  Sometime after setting sail, Jon knocks on the door of Daenerys's cabin. She answers and meets his gaze without words. After a moment, he enters, and, with their eyes still locked, shuts the door. Unaware of the truth of Jon's heritage (the fact that they are biologically aunt and nephew), they finally give into the burgeoning passion between them and consummate their relationship.  Unknown to both of them, Tyrion had also been on his way to speak with his queen, and had seen Jon enter the cabin. Silently concerned at the possible implications of what may occur, Tyrion walks away.  At the Wall Tormund and Beric Dondarrion review the defenses atop the Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Tormund remarks that the crows say he'll get used to the height, but he admits it'll probably be a while. Suddenly, the pair sees movement at the edge of the Haunted Forest. A White Walker emerges atop an undead horse, followed shortly by a horde of wights. More and more White Walkers emerge as the Night Watch's horns sound three times. However, the army of the dead stops some distance from the foot of the Wall and Tormund looks relieved; despite their numbers, the dead don't have anything that could possibly get them past the barrier. But then all on the Wall stop in horror as they hear a very familiar sound; a screeching roar mixed with the heavy thumping of huge wings beating the air.  Suddenly, the undead Viserion swoops down, with the Night King riding on his back. In a burst of bright blue flame, Viserion demolishes some of the scouting platforms atop the Wall and then turns his flames against the Wall itself. Realizing they have no chance against such a foe, Tormund shouts for them all to run and the Night's Watch brothers and wildlings alike desperately try to evacuate as ice melts and rock crumbles. Tormund and Beric watch in horror as the entire eastern extremity of the Wall collapses under Viserion's breath and crashes into the sea, leaving a gap between the Wall and the sea large enough for the army of the dead to cross. A road now open to them, the White Walkers direct the wights to begin their march into the North. Wights and giants and other monstrosities march by the thousands into the North as the undead Viserion and Night King fly overhead to lead the march. The Great War has begun."], "review": ["I will divide the review in to 3 sections, mixed in with a bit of recap and my opinions.King\u2019s LandingKing\u2019s Landing is surrounded by Dany\u2019s armies. Something that should have happened in episode 2. The Unsullied take a reasonable amount of time to make it across Westeros and this is how travel times are supposed to be managed on the show. In contrast, we got travel times of ridiculously short lengths last week.Bronn and Jaime have an interesting conversation about wars and cocks. I won\u2019t disagree with Bronn. All that coin and no cock. I guess the Unsullied purchase a lot of cheesecake. Hot Pie\u2019s business must be booming.Interestingly, Cersie\u2019s queen\u2019s-guard have changed uniform and sigils. They are no longer \u2018white cloaks\u2019. They wear black head to toe. A very generic touch by the show-writers to portray Cersei as evil and tinkering with GRRM\u2019s inversion of common fantasy tropes. The group is headed by the mountain and the rest of the members are unknown. They have a sigil on their breastplates that I can not recognize or relate to any faction within GoT (comment if you can shed light on this).Dany\u2019s queen\u2019sguard is a bunch of rapey, stinking Dothrakis.The trip to Dragonpit includes plenty of filler conversation. Missandei gets paid for doing absolutely nothing on the show, so she is brought on to question what the Dragonpit was built for, and Jorah gives the viewers a mini history lesson. I enjoyed the interaction between Brienne and the Hound. I glimpsed a shadow of a smile on the Hound\u2019s face after he learns about Arya and her success as a warrior. I would actually enjoy a love triangle between Brienne, Tormund and the Hound. It would be far more interesting than the other love stories we have in this season.The Hound gives the Mountain a fair warning. It is not clear if the Mountain really cares or understands it, but this is an obvious indication that Cleganebowl will definitely happen in season 8.Dany makes a grand entrance that was expected. However, by displaying her power and might, she displayed her vulnerability as well. She brings along two dragons and Cersei is clever enough to spot Viserion missing.Euron\u2019s call for Theon to submit had me in a giggle fit. It is very irrelevant and Theon has nothing to submit. It just goes to show that the viewers should sit back, and enjoy this \u2018Second Hand Jack Sparrow\u2019 and his silly little lines.Then, we have Tyrion giving a presentation which is followed by he and Jon selling anti-Wight products.Infomercial:Tyrion: Do you have a Wight problem in your castle? Do you always get those nasty blue eyed dead men creep up on you and tear your siblings apart? Well, we are here to tell you of the new products that are revolutionizing the anti-Wight industry. Here to help me demonstrate is my not-so-tall friend, the King in the North, Jon Snow.Jon: *fake salesman laugh*, Ohh Tyrion, you are one to talk. But he is right, folks of KL, I am here to show you the perfect technique to eliminate your Wight problem. And no, it is not showing them Tyrion\u2019s noseless face. *fake salesman laugh*Tyrion: *laughing gaily*Jon: Here it is folks. You will not believe your eyes. We have the new \u2018au naturale\u2019 line of products that will rid you of your Wight problem, once and for all.Tyrion: *echoing sentiments* Once and for all.Jon: Folks, remember, this is a special deal, and we are only doing it in your capital city. We have performed demonstrations before in Dragonstone and the North. All our customers have been 100 percent satisfied. If you die using our products on a Wight, we will refund your kin your golden dragons and give them a Targaryen cloak. To match the cloak of Daenerys Stormborn, Queen of\u2026\u2026\u2026.The Hound: Fucking get on with it you midget cunts!!Tyrion: Oh such fire in your voice my burnt man.Jon: No need to wake the dog, Tyrion. Now would you bring the test-Wight, my burnt man.Jon: Here you have it folks. We are so certain our product works that we will perform a live demonstration.Tyrion: My bastard friend is right. You will no longer have to purchase second rate products from the Stormlands. Because our products are superior.Jon: That is right folks. You can\u2019t purchase second rate products as the Stormland don\u2019t exist on our show anymore.Tyrion:Jon: Err\u2026I mean observe!!!Tyrion: Our products work, 60% of the time, EVERY TIME!!Jon: Folks, you have seen it for yourselves. Now try it for yourselves!! We have a limited offer that we are giving to our first 25 queens. So get in early and save. What is the low low low price of this unbelievable offer, Tyrion?Tyrion: Now listen up the good queen of King\u2019s Landing. This is a limited offer which will never be repeated. And I mean NEVER!Jon: *echoing sentiments* Never!!Tyrion: The low low price of this offer is a truce. No war till we take care of the army of the dead.*End of infomercial*Qyburn is quite interested in the Wight arm. I am sure he wants to perform some sort of experiments on it so he can fine-tune his next line of Un-Gregors.Cersei asks Jon not to take up arms against the Lannisters or take sides in the war. Which is fair. This is where Jon\u2019s stupidity shows. Not because he told the truth. But because he \u2018bent the knee\u2019. Dany had already seen the army of the dead, she could not unsee it and she was bound to help defeat the NK. Cersei and Dany would wage war on each other while the north stays out of the war until there is an eventual winner. Then a deal, truce or submission could have been discussed. Cersei rightfully feels played. I am not sure if Davos was aware of Jon bending to knee to Dany, or not. His reaction was strange. He seemed as if he had heard the news for the first time.Cersei retreats to her chambers with Tyrion following her. Tyrion\u2019s talent is his mouth. He aims to please her using his mouth and get a deal done. Dany pulls out the dead-child/dragon card which is not Jon\u2019s fault. Another subtle hint that she desires real children to replace her dead dragon. Jon better get some protein bars and get ready.Lena does an amazing job in this episode. With mediocre dialogue and plot, Lena truly puts all her talents into salvaging the episode. Tyrion plays the victim card and Cersei does not buy it. Both the characters are in the right. Tyrion\u2019s murder of Tywin left the Lannister family open to attack from all sources. Ellaria would not have dared poison Myrcella with Tywin alive, and the faith could not have controlled Tommen. However, Tyrion could not just let Tywin get away with his hatred of Tyrion and his hypocrisy. The ending of their conversation is cut and we do not see it. It would be interesting to find out what went on in that room. This could be the issue on Tyrion\u2019s mind later in the episode.Cersei calls her banners, or so it seems on the surface. Varys has a big smile on his face. That is what his role has been reduced to in this season.More references are made to Jon and Dany getting together. Dany comments on how she is the last of her family and Jon consoles her by suggesting the witch may have been blowing hot air about her infertility. Stay tuned for Jon testing out Dany\u2019s fertility later in the episode.One aspect the show got right was Dany\u2019s reference to her family\u2019s source of power being the dragons. This should be taken at face value by the audience who assume Dany is some sort of demi-god or all powerful magical being. Without dragons who were given to her as eggs, she would be either part of the Dosh Khaleen or a pile of ashes in Drogo\u2019s pyre.Jaime has obviously been seduced by Jon and Tyrion\u2019s sales pitch and is planning the transport of their armies to the north. Cersei interrupts him and informs him of her real plans to which Jaime does not react well. A reference to Jon is made as \u201cthe Stark boy\u201d, which is in STARK contrast to him always labelled as the \u201cbastard\u201d by Cersei. They are pushing the Stark reference more obviously until he is unveiled as a Targaryen.I like Cersei\u2019s planning and the brokering of a deal with the Golden Company. Euron\u2019s departure makes more sense now and he still seems to be with Cersei, where many people thought he would switch allegiance to Dany in favor of her dragons. However, the part I dislike is the manner in which Jaime abandons Cersei. This was a long time coming. It happened at the end of AFFC, but the show dragged it on. I would have much preferred it if Jaime abandoned Cersei at the end of last season, where he shows up and watches Cersei being crowned and half the city destroyed. That was the perfect moment to leave behind the mad-queen. I am also very disappointed that this is the reason Jaime abadones Cersei. Specially, when she is carrying his child. Jaime never played the father to his other children, but he was always in the delivery room and always by Cersei\u2019s side. Jaime abandones Cersei due to her lies, deceit, manipulation and infidelity in the books. The infidelity did not make it big on the show, or at all. Jaime\u2019s life revolved around Cersei and his love for her. It is a monumental occasion when he breaks free of her false love and tries to correct the wrong of his ways. In any case, finally, Jaime abandons Cersei and she is left with the crazy folk, Euron, Qyburn and the Mountain.Jaime\u2019s departure coincides with snow falling on KL. It is a sad moment. Jaime often feels remorse about failing to protect Rhaegar\u2019s children in the books. He is haunted by dreams of it. He is finally headed to protect and assist Rhaegar\u2019s child, Jon. He is no longer dressed in Lannister gear. He is his own man. He has Widow\u2019s Wail with him. The two swords made from Ice will be reunited back in Winterfell in season 8. I expect Bronn to follow Jaime. His little conversation with Tyrion perhaps put the thought in his head. Cersei will do Bronn no favors and they hate each other. Both on and off the show. Lena and Jerome have a deal not to shoot scenes together. I am sure that Bronn will follow Jaime north. Darkness ascends on KL and it is a sign that the last good thing (Jaime) has left KL. I am quite worried for Jaime. He will be in the north where the fan favorites are. He may be pushed behind the scenes as Tyrion and Varys have been. When was the last time Varys did or said anything of importance? His death has to come next and it may be as ridiculous as LF\u2019s.WinterfellDue to lack of quality writing and plot points in the absence of popular characters, the north has been reduced to this little cat and mouse game between Sansa and LF. By all rights, LF should have died much earlier, or his character should not have been butchered. He is much better than to lurk in the corners and made the butt of every jape. Sansa carefully sets up Baelish and the show has finally made an attempt to portray Sansa learning deceit and manipulation from LF. A few seasons too late. LF does make a good point though. A recurrent theme within the season is that Jon and Dany are both young and unmarried. If you have not figured out by now, these two are hinted subtly to end up together.Sansa indirectly discusses Baelish\u2019s crimes with him. How he rose to power in the Vale by killing Lysa to become the Lord Protector. She makes it seem as though she is discussing Arya. This part is well set up. Arya is brought to the audience chamber and Baelish is addressed for his crimes. He is initially shocked and denies the crimes, but here is Bran. Acting like maester Aemon. I am not sure if it is a deliberate ploy, but Bran looks blind, often. Even when he not Warging anything. Just as maester Aemon did. Bran mentions the manner which Baelish betrayed Ned. Baelish immediately starts to beg and falls to his knees. This is badly done! There is no reason Baelish should accept his crimes. There is no proof for him betraying Ned. No one else can see what Bran sees. It is a bit over the top for everyone to accept that Baelish betrayed Ned. His murder of Lysa was technically done to save Sansa as Lysa was looking to drag Sansa through the moon door. But, the show is looking to close character plots and move on to Dany and Jon. A better move would have been to have the Hound stop in Winterfell on the way to the Wall where he provides evidence of Baelish\u2019s betrayal of Ned as he is one of the few persons alive who was present in the throne room on that day. This is not a fair trial, it is an accusation, judgement and sentencing all in one go. I doubt Baelish would ever fall to his knees begging in the books. If he dies, he would die still lying through his teeth and would never admit his role in the chaos. Arya cuts his throat and Baelish is finally put out of his misery. This is not the northern way. Ned and Robb executed their men in front of the heart tree. It was a nice piece of irony to have Baelish killed by his own dagger. I assume many viewers applauded Baelish\u2019s death, but I didn\u2019t. I knew his death would come at some point, but a character with his complexity and aura needed a different death. A complex plot revealing his crimes and then a sacrifice at the base of the heart tree to conjure up some well needed magic. Perhaps, fodder for Bran\u2019s power. Finally, the northern dilemma and mediocre plot with LF ends. It is unclear when the two sisters began to plot this, and when Bran got involved. But let\u2019s not mind that. Because it is GoT and who cares about logic anymore. The sisters make up and mention Ned, which is a nice moment portraying the legacy the great man left behind. I wonder if the lords know of Jon bending the knee. Or if even Arya knows! How would they react? Stay tuned for season 8, where real issues in the plot will not be addressed. But I promise, you will get more Dany and Jon kissing in the rain.Samwell Tarly finally arrives in Winterfell. He immediately goes to see Bran where he goes along with Bran being the 3ER. Apparently, everyone believes him now. Bran is in front of a fire and suspiciously looks like he is staring at it when he sees visions. Does he get visions from the fire, too? Will this be important in the next season?After refusing to tell his own sisters, Bran tells Sam that Jon is the son of Rhaegar. And a Sand! Oh, c\u2019mon D&D. You guys are an absolute joke. Bastards are not given surnames for their location of birth, Their surname is for whichever parent or kin that claims them. Jon is still a Snow for Ned claimed him. If Rhaegar had claimed him, he would be Waters. Apparently Sam remembers Prince Ragger and his indifference towards that passage read by Gilly. He remembers every part of that passage and gives Bran the brilliant idea Bran hadn\u2019t thought of himself yet, to look for their wedding in a vision. He sees their wedding and declares that Robert\u2019s rebellion was based on a lie. Which is wrong. Robert\u2019s rebellion was based on truth, they rebelled for their lives and Aerys caused it. Rhaegar played a part. But the rebellion was not based on a lie. They are playing the love angle between Rhaegar and Lyanna, rather than the prophecy angel which would make better sense. As it stands, Rhaegar and Lyanna were absolute cunts who plunged the realm into war and death for their love. Parallels between R&L and Jon & Dany are made during Bran\u2019s narration. They are making it seem as if Jon and Dany had to come together, for love. And they might leave behind a child, just as R&L did. *barf*. I don\u2019t know why I still expect quality writing from this show.DragonstoneJon is the war commander now. Tyrion has been demoted. Jon suggests that it would take the Dothraki two weeks to make it to Winterfell along the King\u2019sroad, which is more realistic than the ridiculous time-warps we got last week. They discuss of a one well placed arrow to end Dany. I wonder if this is foreshadowing for an attempt on Dany\u2019s life.The conversation between Theon and Jon was another reference to Jon having to deal with two identities. Targaryen and Stark. He tells Theon that he can be both Stark and Greyjoy, which indicates that Jon will not choose between the two identities. While Rhaegar will be a part of him, he may always remain a Stark.Jon then goes to Dany\u2019s room, the red door. Dany finally has a red door that she always dreamt of. They proceed to test out Dany\u2019s fertility while Bran narrates Jon being the heir to the throne. I wonder if Bran heard Lyanna\u2019s whisper in season 6, and if he did, why does he still think Jon to be a Sand, for Lyanna called him Aegon Targaryen, indicating his legitimacy. I was hoping for Aemon, but his name is Aegon. I still hold out hope that his name could be Aemon in the books. There a few hints for his name being Aemon.Tyrion watches the two have sex and retreats with a suspect look on his face. Some have interpreted this to be jealousy due to his love for Dany. I think this is political worry. Tyrion has plans that do not include Jon and Dany together. Perhaps, he wants to be rid of monarchy and select an heir and does not want Jon and Dany to have a child. Or, it could have something to do with the ending of his conversation with Cersei. I hope they do not ignore and forget that aspect.EastwatchThe Wall comes down through Nazgul on a flapping dragon that looked like the NK was on a sea-saw. The dragon-fire was practically the NK welding against the Wall. The Wall comes down and the White Walkers make it past. Ideally, they should make it to Winterfell before Jon and Dany seeing as it is a short distance to the Wall. I am sure Tormund and Beric are still alive. They will climb out from under the rabble next season.I do not hold too much hope for season 8. They have managed to make the White walkers a side show to the throne. Dany and Jon will save the world and kill the NK before Jon perishes in the war. Dany goes to KL to destroy Cersei. Dany will then die giving birth to their child. The child would be \u2018ice & fire\u2019, well more fire than ice and he will be the heir. Rings of awful twilight scripts. I hope for some conflict between Tyrion and Dany, Varys should have a part in it. Jaime should have a big role and not be pushed into the background. But I am not holding my breath for much logic. There are too many redundant character who should have died in this season to make room for a non-rushed plot next season. Missandei, Davos, Podrik, Brienne, Sansa, Beric, Gilly, Theon, Yara and many more should have died in a big battle or disaster in this last episode. I am not sure what Missandei gets paid for, to be honest.As things stand now, I am supporting the NK, Euron, Cersei and the Golden Company. Cersei can\u2019t be made a redundant character as she is the main villain. Lena is an excellent actor who still commands respect and is holding the episodes together. I fear greatly for Nikolaj and his role next season. I don\u2019t think we will get a bittersweet ending in the show as promised by GRRM. Dany or Jon\u2019s death at the moment will not sadden me. It will not be bittersweet. It will actually be a good thing. Their child left behind will make it a fairy tale.It is about time I conclude this post. Here is Jaime Lannister for those who appreciate the books.", "Overall\u2026kind of shit. There was one huge flaw this season that really bugged me: fan-service.One of the great things about this series (books and show) was that the writers didn't really give a shit what you wanted.Characters rose and fell based on their own merits, not on any kind of audience interference. It was unpredictable (unless you were Littlefinger), and highly engaging.This season finale and season, were a huge , painful exception.Call me a masochist - but I want to be blindsided. I want important characters to die for their missteps.But instead, fans got their wish list checked off:Incestuous sex with Dany and Jon. Check.Jamie leaving Cersei. Check.Theon redeeming himself. Check.Sansa outmanipulating Littlefinger. Check.All the living Starks reunited. Check.Arya enacting her revenge/mass murder. Check.Small and sweet reunions between frenemies (Bron, Tyrion, Podrick, etc.) Check.Jon surviving another near death experience inexplicably. Check.Dany basically beating the crap out of Lannisters. Check.Ugh\u2026I could go on.Not to mention the subtle as an undead ice-dragon hints they kept dropping.Dany: I CAN\u2019T HAVE BABIES!You sure about that?Jon: I wasn't looking at her longingly.Sure.One dragon dies.Good thing there are only 2 remaining Targareyns.Bran: I'm the three eyed raven. I need to train more. I can see the past and the present.You said 3 eyes, right? Maybe you're forgetting the FUTURE!Nothing to do now but wait and hope that the show can get back on track for the final season.EDIT: Bas Leijser added some additional fan-service notes in the comments which were too good not to share:Foreshadowing of Cleganebowl. Check.Tormund (a fan favorite) survives. Check.Main characters survive while a bunch of redshirts die (when the Wall collapses). Check.Night King rides wight dragon (instead of just controlling it). Check.Night King takes down Wall with his present from Daenerys. Check.Continued dick jokes with Podrick. Check.Continued eunuch jokes. Check.Rhaegar and Lyanna\u2019s marriage turned into a sappy love story. Check.", "Disclaimer-This is not a funny review.The reviewer tries to observe and report each sequence,story progression and character nuances to the best of his ability.And he takes his Game of Thrones very seriously.This is how the episode unfolded:-1.Dany showboats her armies. This episode began with montage of assembling troops, and ended with marching troops. A final call to the arms in a way. Well, in the opening sequence, Bronn and Jaime pities the \u2018cockless\u2019 Unsullied, perhaps because they had been able to cuckold and trap them in Casterly rock. But soon, the Dothraki march up and remind them of their own miserable fate at the Loot Train battle.2.Tyrion tells Jon Snow a million or more live at King\u2019s Landing.Tells him there\u2019s more job opportunities and far more brothels. That\u2019s why you liked living there, Tyrion! Stop projecting. Meanwhile, the Hound gives the lonely wight some company.3.Cersei gives instructions to the Hound. Jaime starts frowning at her orders pretty early in this episode. This season, the show prepares us for everything.4.The delegates arrive. Brienne is already here, and sees the Hound is alive.Tyrion, Podrick and Bronn reuinte. Tyrion and Bronn trade insults but then cuts the BS and admit they are glad to see each other .Everyone gets to meet everyone. Bronn leaves with Podrick. Because A. The drink might make Pod spill the beans about Team Dany & Jon, while Bronn gets to gauge if he has a better chance of getting a castle if he sides with them. B. He wants to change teams, but more because of the dragons and the Dothraki. Sadly he didn\u2019t get to see the undead to realize that the other side isn\u2019t necessarily greener. C. He didn\u2019t want to remain in the line of sight of Cersei, whom he had vexed by luring away Jaime to meet Tyrion. If the meeting went south, Cersei might remember to harm Bronn along with the visitors.5. Dany brings two dragons and shows all her cards. Does a mistake in my opinion. Cersei deduces that dragons are vulnerable after all, even if not to Qyburn\u2019s \u2018scorpion\u2019 ballista. Later, she makes Jon reveal his allegiance(simply by invoking Ned Stark\u2019s name) and gets to know Jon is siding with Dany. Something that was unclear to most till this point. Cersei thus gets her hand on important information throughout this meeting.6.Tyrion starts the talking,like he always does. Jon joins in.While the Hound demonstrates the wight, Jon tells them fire and dragonglass can kill the wights, but doesn\u2019t mention Valyrian steel.7.Euron makes a scene of deserting. As planned with Cersei. Maybe Cersei is reading Sun Tzu. \u201cAppear weak when you are strong\u201d. And Euron doesn't want to be under careful vigilance of Team Dany as he goes to Essos for Golden Company.8.Jon makes an endearing little speech again and declares fealty to Dany. Cersei, maybe inspired by Jon, tells her actual plan. She will wait out the war while her enemies struggle to contain the paranormal threat.9.Jaimie is now treading jokes with Tyrion and even seems to worry for him as he enters Cersei\u2019s chambers.10. Tyrion is no fool. He baits Cersei to kill him, knowing fully well Cersei can\u2019t afford to do that with two dragons at her doorstep. He also realizes Cersei is with a child. Did he just kill this one too, by giving her wine? Unknowingly, maybe?..11. Dany and Jon discuss her fertility in enemy territory. So absurd.And talks about \u2018getting fucked\u2019. Get on with it, then! We are also given a hint that Mirri Maz Dur's prophecy may just be a spiteful lie. And the show might ignore it in S8 .12.Cersei finally tells the delegation she will send her army North to fight the undead. Ofcourse, what she doesn\u2019t tell is that she will send her army, but only to take the Northern lands. Very clever, and yet so foolish to be so cocky in a show like this. Perfect laid plans are blown to smithereens in a matter of episodes here. Just ask Tyrion.13. It\u2019s desolate in Winterfell. In the gloom, LF tells Sansa his playbook and tries to incite her against Arya. But as we will soon find out, he forgets to play by it himself. And doesn\u2019t account for Bran and his special powers. Rookie move, Baelish.14.We see Jon giving the plans for troop movement in Dragonstone, and not Tyrion. Finally, eugenics has been implemented. Dany takes Jon's advice over Jorah's and that seems more symbolic than tactical. Jorah looks like he will have an aneurysm,does he realise what's going to happen when the two sail together?Theon notices Jon is the one calling the shots and asks his permission to leave. He needs to save Yara. Tells him all his mistakes happened because he was always torn between being a Greyjoy and a Stark. Jon forgives him from his side and tells him that he\u2019s both Greyjoy and a Stark. Maybe this is a foreshadowing for Jon's own future grappling with dual citizenship.15. In a reversal of the scene at Winterfell, Theon actually prevails upon his men this time. He gets into a fight, which is seemingly the Ironborne way of deciding everything. Theon\u2019s opponent goes for his nuts without realising Ramsay had already taken care of that. We are reminded that the writers get a year to write just seven episodes. Ample time to pull in punches and use crafty tropes.16.Northerners all assemble at Winterfell\u2019s great hall. LF has orchestrated this to be Arya\u2019s reckoning, but realizes late that it\u2019s his own funeral. He has been played. Sansa never misses a foot here. She carefully alienates the Knights of the Vale first. By telling them LF killed Lady Lhysa and plotted to kill Lord Arryn. She also has ensured that the headstrong Lyanna Mormont is not there, so that LF can\u2019t do shit by bringing up her infamous letter. Tyrion\u2019s name is redeemed yet again from another crime he didn\u2019t commit. Arya slits LF\u2019s throat, and we see the dagger truly avenging Ned Stark\u2019s death. It\u2019s coming for you, Cersei!17.Jaime is instructing the bannermen. This is Season 7, episode 7. So ofcourse, there are only 7 bannermen pledging to House Lannister. Cersei later talks to Jaime privately and calls him the \u2018stupidest Lannister\u2019. She tells him about her scheme, about the Golden Company and their elephants and 20,000 men.The Iron bank\u2019s support. But with all that new information, Jaime now turns against Cersei. Because A. His moral code found a voice for itself after that talk of honor by Jon Snow. B. Brienne did her bit by telling him to fuck loyalty and to just chose the \u2018living\u2019. C. He has given a word to join the fight up North, and he doesn\u2019t break vows. D.The dying testimony of the wise Olenna must have been on the back of his mind. E. Cersei gloats about no one walks away from here.And the show doesn't take kindly to that kind of sentiment. Just ask Dany how she feels about her indestructible dragons. Poor Cersei, for all your clever manipulations, you might be the \u2018stupidest Lannister\u2019 yet. Tyrion probably plotted all of this to drive a wedge between you and Jaime. And it worked! Cersei thinks Tyrion killing Tywin left the Lannisters exposed,but hardly realises that Tyrion taking away Jaime exposes Cersei to danger more than anything else. It also opens up the possibility of an amorous relationship between Cersei and Euron in S8 .Maybe Cersei let's go of Jaime because she has a baby now and can form a dynasty on her own.Jaime leaves, and KL has no one worth saving anymore.(Commoners don't count in GoT. They are 'sheep'.)18. In a beautiful portray of scenery, Jaime crosses the greenery of South for the snow capped North, where a war will be waged. Cersei gave the correct assessment when she said he was always the one to run after adventures. The next scene, snow falls in KL for the first time. Its pouring down in the hallway with the maps. Winter has reached King\u2019s Landing.19.Bran will tell anyone who\u2019d care to listen that he\u2019s the three eyed raven now. It\u2019s no different when he meets Sam. Together they unearth Jon\u2019s secret origin. He\u2019s the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, who were officially wed by the High Septon. Rhaegar\u2019s previous marriage was annulled. Roberts\u2019 rebellion was based on a lie afterall. (The Barratheon claim to the throne is dissolved).Bran tells Sam he can see the past and the present(but not the future?yet he is the three eyed Raven ,no less) He is man of his words as well and puts his money where his mouth is. So he starts watching both the past and the present, together. And we get to see with him. While Bran talks about his aunt, Lyanna Stark,Jon is seen approaching his aunt, Daenerys Targaryen. When Bran tells about the love between his aunt and the Targaryen prince, Jon is seen making love to his aunt, who\u2019s also a Targaryen royalty. Clever wordplay and imagery all around. Both have been nude on the show before. And yet the scene was brief,perhaps because the makers wanted to spare us more screentime of gory incest.And I feel for the actor who player Rhaegar Targaryen. He got like 2 seconds of fame,literally. The two get married under s three only with the high Septon in presence,no doubt to explain why no word got out.There\u2019s one other witness to this unintentional transgression. Tyrion Lannister. And maybe Tyrion realizes that Dany may now find a heir of her own. Does it bother him that this circumvents his chances of becoming the Queen\u2019s successor? Or was it simply jealousy,because Jon is now Dany's most trusted advisor?I hope Tyrion isn't lusting after his queen.He could still turn up to be a Targaryen. There's only so much of incest that we can take.20. The sisters are bonding after LF\u2019s death and Bran probably has cleared the air between the two by his \u2018insights\u2019, offscreen. Arya now knows about Sansa's hardships and says she wouldn't have survived those. She owns this scene too. Love or hostility, Arya seems more endearing than her elder sister. This sequence has all the candour of a similar scene from last year. Between Jon and Sansa, catching up at the same spot in Winterfell.( \u201cA raven came to Winterfell..white raven! Winter is here.\u201d \u201cWell, father always promised didn\u2019t he?\u201d) Another carefully crafted callback.21.Bran wargs into ravens again and observes Eastwatch. Beric and Tormund witness the undead invasion. The NK mounts undead Viserion and burns down a large segment of the wall. Viserion doesn't need to be politely asked (dracarys) to do a flamethrower .In one of the scenes, we are shown the edge of the wall for the first time. To instill the idea that,What has a beginning has an end. The last sequence from the previous season showed Dany\u2019s armada setting sail for Westeros, with dragons. This season\u2019s last scene shows NK\u2019s countless footsoldiers and a few giants marching past the wall, spearheaded by a dragon.Now, The Easter eggWhere are these jolly band of undead heading to?Look closely at the top left part of the congregation . The Stark emblem.No,not for Jon.He\u2019s not a Stark, remember?They want the three eyed Raven.", "SPOILERSThey didn't even bother to explain how the Unsullied got out of CR and to KL. Did Euron just backed off and the Unsullied swam their way to KL? Who rescued them, Dany or Dothraki or they themselves? They are still standing to 8000. Aren't many of them already dead \u2013 in Mereen, and then in CR, no?It was all for nothing if the Unsullied were to be brought on a whim. I really thought GreyWorm would be dead and if that happened, which could have only happened at the hands of Euron, Daenerys would go berserk and do some impulsive Mad Queen sort of things.Nice chatting between Bronn and Jaime. Which castle did he get, by the way, now that he is a lord?What the hell? That place doesn't look like KL. They shot it at Highgarden's location. The Dothraki entrance seen seems to have been taken from Daenerys\u2019 train loot attack Dothraki\u2019s entrance seen.How many ships does Daenerys actually have? (Smack that, I am asking this as a question now?)Jon, Jorah, Davos, Tyrion, Missandei are shown on a ship to KL. Where is Gendry? Missandei is wearing the shoulder cape like Dany.That \u201cthing\u201d has crossed the magic Wall. The Hound keeps checking on him.Nice little bantering between Tyrion, Podrick and Bronn. And everyone else.There's a meme, which is more of a fact going on around the Internet: \u201cArya Stark is not in danger; she is the danger\u201d. That was also Brienne\u2019s statement regarding her to Sandor.Dragonpit's depiction was incorrect. It's supposed to be much larger than that. Drogon could barely flap its wings there, not even move or go around in it. The structure is smaller than its book counterpart.I am surprised Cersei didn't comment about Sandor's allegiance to her enemy. She would have not knowing that he's not really allied to anyone.Cersei was the only one in the party who behaved as though the flamethrower beast didn't surprise her. She sat still on her chair.Show Euron being show Euron. And Theon is killing it.That thing's demonstration was as if they were doing a magic show. Cersei was terrified if it. Rejects the truce.Jon's every bit of Ned Stark's son. Even if he's biologically R+L, he's Ned's son, no matter what. This is also proved while he and Theon talk when they reach Dragonstone (point 22).Seems like this for the first time since Tyrion was born that he and Cersei have talked about their thoughts and feelings? Actually, properly talked to each other.Dany accepts that she is nothing without her dragons. That realization might have come from losing Viserion.\u201cAnd your family hasn't seen it's end\u201d. Plus that the witch who murdered her husband might not have been a reliable source of information. What else, this just points towards one fact: Dany is fit to have children and she will get pregnant in the future (point 31).Tyrion does what he's good at. Outtalking people and gets Cersei to agree on the truce.Sansa is taking her lessons all that very well. She is the best person to know that Arya is not the sort of person to vouch for titles and castles. She has no interest whatsoever in becoming the Lady of Winterfell. LF thought everyone is going against each other. Everyone wants to be a lord or lady and that is his mistake.\u201cWe will sail together\u201d - Daenerys. Aye, aye. A lit of people have already shipped you together. Is it just me or everyone else who's reading Jon and Dany's words and their conversations as romantic chats or whatever you call it?Finally, they gave Theon a story. He struggles between Stark and Greyjoy. He's both. He's finally been forgiven. Theon fans have been waiting for this since long. Up until now no one has wanted him around themselves, except Yara and Sansa. Yara more than anyone.He has a mission now. Alfie Allen takes the cookie. He's stronger than ever. Yara rescue mission on way. I am happy that they didn't lay waste to his character. In the last season, there was no development, which was disappointing but this episode had. Maybe they saved the best for the last.Like I said before, Bran is the Legislature, Sansa is the Judiciary and Arya is the Executive. LF has a tough hide. If it were in the books he wouldn't have died like that. He's smart to read people and sense what people want. Albeit, he will die similarly in the books but with a stronger story line.Arya's good at killing. I watched and re-watched her slashing LF's throat in a slash many a times. The way she pulled it off amazing \u2013 both Arya and Maisie Williams.Cersei is invulnerable. I so much love that hateful character.Jaime has left Cersei's side. He is coming to realise what he ought to have realized earlier. I like it. Like Theon, they are giving his story line a proper arc as well.Winter has reached KL and the South. The slow GoT theme takes the cookie now. It will be poetic to see him aid Jon, Rhaegar's son in the Great War. Jaime has dreams of not being able to protect Elia, Aegon and Rhaenys. This would deem poetic when he helps Jon in the Great War. And, oh, Jaime\u2019s cloak is black from white.But another fact, how will the volanqar theory come to reality if he is up North all the time. Since the prophecy has to come true, I imagine the twins will meet again.Bran being the generation's emo goth kid. Does not respond with words, instead shows Samwell the letter he got from Jon.As is the episode's name, it was a throwback to Rhaegar and Lyanna's marriage, showing Jon and Dany's love in parallel, while revealing Jon's name is actually Aegon Targaryen. The only parallel bit left to show was Dany getting pregnant with Jon's kid, like Lyanna did with Rhaegar's. And then the Targ dies. So basically it means Dany will die while Jon will father their logic and continue the Fire+(Fire+Ice) branch?Just yesterday I was whingeing to my friend how they have laid waste to the book plot by having Jon and Dany together.One thing: why does Bran insist Jon\u2019s real name is Aegon Sand if he already knows Lyanna named him Aegon Targaryen? I think the showmakers just wanted to remind Samwell of the records he transcribed in the Citadel.I actually felt as if they had casted the same Harry Lloyd, with the same hair wig for Rhaegar. Just a bit taller, until I googled \u201cRhaegar Targaryen actor\u201d. This was the exact vision Dany has of Rhaegar in tHoU \u2013 a man looking exactly like Viserys, just a bit taller and a different eye color. I like how the showmakers represent him exactly like Dany sees him in the books.Arya and Sansa don't have any differences. They acknowledge each other. We hear Ned Stark's line that we heard in Sansa's voice in S7 trailer. It adds cherry to the cake.I wonder how is the NK screaming \u201csuvion\u201d (High Valyrian for \u201cice\u201d) at the undead Viserion if he's mute.Tormund and Beric ought to be dead. And Gendry too if he's still at the Wall (point 5).The episode was predictable.", "It\u2019s official.Game of Thrones has officially ruined my taste.Twofold are my observations.Maybe thematically that works: two impressions. It\u2019s like the twin themes of Ice and Fire, diametrically opposed, yet hooking up in a way that is so beautiful it can only result in Kit Harrington.Only instead of Ice and Fire, it\u2019s A Song of Stupid and Awesome. Stupidity and awesomenosity: two different poles of a unified whole.Because that was stupid in so many ways. And I loved it.What I liked about it though is that (finally) they managed to hit on something that I have always liked about the story, but which drives me nuts in the show because of it\u2019s absense.When Jon Snow refuses to lie to Cersei, acting like a typical \u201cstupid Stark\u201d and everyone is like \u201cnice going, JON, you dummy.\u201d I was thinking, actually Jon is right. Not because it is the right thing to do, but because it does make sense. Why lie to the people who you are going to be fighting for? The Northern way is the best way: and I think that message came through (however dumbed down the story had to become to make it happen) with the northern story line too. The pack survives: family trumps ambition and politics; those who seek to divide us with cleverness and lies are the ones we should strike down.Maybe because I have been thinking about division lately: how Trump or whoever\u2019s propaganda machine whoever has so deftly divided people: not only in the US. Right now the political world is all about division and highlighting that and emphasizing it. But anyway: it resonated with me.Still, I had to laugh when they all took turns piling on Jon, and his reactions was, \u201cI know, I know, I\u2019m a dumb Stark, I can already see the memes coming on Facebook.Officially Confirmed; wights can\u2019t swim. I\u2019m telling you: too many holes.Clegane-bowl is definitely coming.The Cersei-Tyrion scene did not work for me at all. The writing had no real feeling in it: the lines felt perfunctory and by the number: yet Lena Heady and Peter Dinklage were trying so very, very, very hard!Man they were acting their asses off in an attempt to sell that shit. I expected them to whip out a cane and a bowler cap and start doing a tap dance, in unison, they were trying so hard. I guess when you get paid 2 million dollars per episode, or whatever, you give it your all!!But it didn\u2019t work for me. I feel like Dinklage needs to be held back a bit: he starts chewing the scenery when he can get a chance. Of course that is better than Nikolai Coster-Waldau who always looks like he is threatening to cry, you can hear him thinking: (Look, audience, I can make myself cry, ain\u2019t I talented?)I am officially shipping this.Cersei, of course, as the anti-Stark, was telling fibs the whole way. I had read spoiler about that, so it came as no surprise, but I think that it was obvious that she was never going to not be political: she is really Trump-like, when I think about it. (Sorry for all the Trump references: he is crammed down our throats twenty-four seven, I am seeing Trump everywhere: I swear to god I thought of him while watching Pac-Man cartoon with my son today.)I\u2019m glad that Jaime finally got some balls and left\u2026and may I say that the montage of snow scenes over the battlements, walls and various locations in King\u2019s Landing was gorgeously done? I mean, that is why the episode was so long: there were so many gorgeous set up shots and so on. I liked that. I am looking forward to 80 minute episodes in Season 8, assuming I live long enough to ever see it.Theon and Jon. That scene meant something to me, even though the dialogue was kind of awful. But it worked for me, nevertheless. I do respond to the idea that Theon is sort of the dark Jon, the outsider who went criminal instead of letting his outsider-ness ennoble him. And Jon, bless his heart redeemed him. Just took three little words: I forgive you.So then he goes out all redeemed, on the Stark side. Ah, but the Greyjoy side is NOT redeemed. The Greyjoy side has to literally beat some beardo to death and then baptize himself, reborn in blood and water, to be redeemed. but he does it. And how does he do it? By letting himself get kicked repeatedly in what used to be his nuts!!!! It\u2019s like he gained superhuman powers with every blow landed until he was a mighty and unstoppable nutless killing machine and he beat that beard\u2019s head into the sand!!!!It\u2019s like that Arthurian story about the guy who is weak in the day time but then he gets kicked in the nuts and becomes super strong.But he has redeemed himself: we saw him baptize himself: it is official. Now he is off to rescue Yara in one of those little rowboats: they are going to row around Westeros. That is OK: they have until 2019 to get there.Danerys: You\u2019re dumb, but I like you anyway, Jon Snow.Jon: I think you are special.Of course we all predicted the Sansa/Arya/LIttlefinger storyline. Yes, LIttlefinger is really stupid. I can see why people bitch about this storyline. But honestly, I liked it. It was utterly predictable, had more plotholes than a animated dead dragon\u2019s wings, but it just went down so smooth, like an oreo liqueur mixed with coffee and whipped cream.Yes it is sickly sweet but it just feels so right. Don\u2019t question it. Just go with it and cheer when Arya walks over to Littlefinger and slices dat throat and blood spurts all over the place and then you see Bran and Sansa watching in their chairs. It rocked for me.I am officially stupid. Sue me. And I loved the little shout-out to Ned Stark that the girls give as they are standing on the battlement, all pack-like and toasty warm in their furs.Littlefinger in that scene, in my opinion, gave by far the greatest performance in the entire Season 7 (not that there is much competition.) I mean I totally bought it, all of it. The look on his face was priceless: the tears of fear, the annoying tone, the slight whine. Kudos to Aidan what\u2019s-his-name, who is finally free to act in something else.Sam: Hey, Bran, remember me?Bran: Yo, Sam.Sam: what up?Bran: I\u2019m the 3Icrow, yo.Sam: cool, what that.Bran: I can see things, like everywhere, man.Sam: Cool, do me a favor and go look to confirm that Rhaegar and Lyanna got married, will you?Bran: Hold on. Holy shit! They totally did. that means: (turns to audience) J-O-N I-S H-E-I-R t-o- t\u2014h-e I-R-O-N T-H-R-O-N-E. )Tyrion doesn\u2019t need weirwood or glass candles: he has his own little redtube on the ship. Cue ominous music for, like, no discernible reason whatsoever. Audience goes, oh, they are such a sexy couple: oh, no, Tyrion is unhappy? Ominous music is playing. Whatever will go wrong?!!!So like the dragon with holes in its wings like spouts blue fire that is also kind of cold, like ice-fire and it doesn\u2019t melt ice or make it colder it like totally blows it up and then the walls come crumbling down.And if you listen to it on headphones, as I did, the choir chants \u201cA Song of ice and fire\u201d while the Dragon blows up everything. Cause he is like fire made ice. I swear it."]}, "68": {"id": "s08e01", "name": "Winterfell", "script": "1 TYRION LANNISTER: We have suffered at each other's hands.

[COUGHS.]  - Which girl? - QYBURN: The queen's brothers  made promises to you and broke them.  Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.  She once gave me a castle and a wife,  then rectified me right out of them.  That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.  When Queen Cersei wants something,  she pays in advance and in gold.  Several chests of it, in fact.  Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.  So she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers.  If it's the Dragon Queen she's after  She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.  Yeah, well, good luck with that.  Our queen's brothers are unlikely  to survive their Northern adventures.  But in the event that they do  [.]  She has a keen sense of poetic justice.  That fucking family.  QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me,  I thought I would die poor and alone,  but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand.  What would she do for the man  who rids her of her treasonous brothers?  [.]  [DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES.]  [SIGHS.] I wanted those elephants.  [EURON SIGHS.]  So  how do I compare to the fat king?

Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks  were slaughtering each other on the battlefield.  Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.  TYRION: And our queen is grateful.  Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point.  The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her.  They don't know her.  The Free Folk don't know her.

TYRION: They do make a handsome couple.  VARYS: You overestimate our influence.  Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.  I'm not that old.  Not as old as him.  [CHUCKLES.]  Our queen respects the wisdom of age.  Of course she does.  Respect is how the young keep us at a distance,  so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.  TYRION: What is that?

(May 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In King's Landing Qyburn informs Cersei Lannister that the White Walkers have breached the Wall, which pleases Cersei. Euron Greyjoy arrives with Yara Greyjoy as his prisoner and with the Golden Company. Euron uses his deeds to convince Cersei to start their relationship, and the pair have sex. Euron insists that he will impregnate Cersei, who appears to be visibly upset when he leaves the room.  Qyburn visits Bronn and presents him with the crossbow Tyrion used to assassinate his father Tywin Lannister. Should Jaime and Tyrion survive the war against the dead, Cersei wants Bronn to assassinate them.  In the Narrow Sea Theon Greyjoy secretly boards Euron's flagship in the night and frees his sister Yara. Yara decides to retake the Iron Islands while Euron is distracted by matters in King's Landing, whereas Theon decides to journey to Winterfell to fight the undead with Daenerys and the Starks.  At Last Hearth Tormund Giantsbane and Beric Dondarrion, having survived the fall of Eastwatch, lead their party into House Umber's seat of Last Hearth, already sacked by the dead. They encounter Eddison Tollett, who had evacuated the Night's Watch from Castle Black. They find young Lord Ned Umber, who had been evacuating Last Hearth's inhabitants, dead and impaled to a wall. Tormund declares that they must reach Winterfell before the Night King. Ned reanimates as a wight, and Beric burns him with his flaming sword.  At Winterfell Daenerys Targaryen arrives at Winterfell alongside Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Jorah Mormont, Varys and Missandei, with Grey Worm leading her Unsullied and Dothraki armies. Jon reunites with Bran and Daenerys is greeted by Sansa Stark, the townspeople, and the Northern lords, though the pleasantries are cut short when Bran Stark reveals to Daenerys and Jon that the Night King has reanimated Viserion and breached the Wall. Sansa has ordered the Northern lords to retreat to Winterfell to make the stand against the undead, but at council, Lyanna Mormont and the other lords express displeasure towards Jon for abandoning his position as King in the North by swearing fealty to a Targaryen. This tension is magnified when Tyrion declares that the Lannister army will soon march north too; Sansa fears that the combined forces might overstretch their supplies, but in private implies to Tyrion that she does not believe Cersei will send her army.  Arya reunites with Jon, Gendry (who is working in Winterfell's forges crafting dragonglass weapons), and the Hound. Davos Seaworth suggests to Tyrion and Varys that the Northerners could be won over by betrothing Jon and Daenerys. Jon and Daenerys ride the dragons, deepening their bond. Later, Sansa accuses Jon of bending the knee out of love for Daenerys.  Samwell Tarly meets Daenerys, who thanks him for curing Jorah of his greyscale, but after discovering his identity admits that she executed his father, Randyll, and his brother, Dickon. Bran instructs a heartbroken Samwell to tell Jon about his true Targaryen heritage, the news of which leaves Jon stunned.

TYRION LANNISTER: We must fight together now  or die.  - The things I do for love. - (BRAN STARK GASPS)  [.]   DAENERYS: When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story  about the man who murdered our father.  Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat.  Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched  as his blood poured onto the floor.  He told me other stories as well.  About all the things we would do to that man  once we took back the Seven Kingdoms  and had him in our grasp.  Your sister pledged to send her army north.  She did.  I don't see an army.  I see one man, with one hand.  It appears your sister lied to me.  She lied to me as well.  She never had any intention of sending her army north.  She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops.  The Golden Company from Essos,  bought and paid for.  Even if we defeat the dead,  she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.  \"We\"?  I promised to fight for the living.  I intend to keep that promise.  - Your Grace, I know my brother - Like you knew your sister?  He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received.  Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?  Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him,  right up to the moment he slits my throat.  SANSA: You're right. We can't trust him.  He attacked my father in the streets.  He tried to destroy my house and my family,  the same as he did yours.  JAIME: Do you want me to apologize?  I won't.  We were at war.  Everything I did, I did for my house and my family.  I'd do it all again.  The things we do for love.  DAENERYS: So why have you abandoned your house and family now?  JAIME: Because this goes beyond loyalty.  This is about survival.  You don't know me well, Your Grace.  But I know Ser Jaime.  He is a man of honor.  I was his captor once.  But when we were both taken prisoner  and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me,  Ser Jaime defended me.  And lost his hand because of it.  Without him, my lady, you would not be alive.  He armed me, armored me,  and sent me to find you and bring you home  because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.  You vouch for him?  BRIENNE: I do.  You would fight beside him?  I would.  I trust you with my life.  If you trust him with yours,  we should let him stay.  What does the Warden of the North say about it?  [SIGHS.]  We need every man we can get.  Very well.  [INHALES SHARPLY.]  [.]  Thank you, Your Grace.  [.]  Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise,  or you didn't know at all.  Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.  - I was a fool. - Not for the first time.  Cersei still sits on the throne.  If you can't help me take it back,  I'll find another Hand who can.

And I would still be Brandon Stark.  - You're not? - BRAN: No.  I'm something else now.  [RAVEN CAWS.]  You're not angry at me.  I'm not angry at anyone.  Why didn't you tell them?

Yes, here we are.  Together again.  [MAN CLEARS THROAT.]  [SPITS.]  And the masses rejoice.  How do they feel about their new queen?  She's your new queen too.  They remember what happened  the last time Targaryens brought dragons north.  They'll come around  once they see Daenerys is different.  And she is? Different?  TYRION: She is.  - You're sure about her? - I am.  She didn't seem sure about you.  It's hard to blame her.  I made a mistake common to clever people.  - I underestimated my opponents. - Hmm.  Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her.  A chance for you both to start again.  And I believed her.  MAN: That stuff can go on the end.  Was she lying about the baby too?  No, that part is real.  She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies.  I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.  She's fooled me more than anybody.  CHILD: No, he's right there.  What?  She never fooled you.  You always knew exactly what she was,  and you loved her anyway.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  So  [HORSE NEIGHS.]  we're going to die at Winterfell.

At least Cersei won't get to murder me.  I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction  denying her that pleasure  while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.  [PEOPLE ARGUING.]  Maybe after I'm dead  I'll march down to King's Landing  and rip her apart.  MAN: You will see the Army of the Dead.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  MAN: Good.  [MAN GRUNTING.]  [HOOFBEATS POUNDING.]  [THUDS.]  PODRICK: Good. Yes, aim.  [BOTH GRUNT.]  Don't rush.  Come forward.  - Come on. - Ser Jaime.  Lady Brienne.  [SWORDS CLASHING.]  - He's come a long way. - He's all right.  PODRICK: One more time. Come on.  - Still has a lot to learn. - I'm sure you'll teach him.  PODRICK: Better, better.  I've been told you're commanding the left flank.  I am.  It's, uh It's good ground.  It is.  The rise, it should give us some advantage.  If we can keep a tight formation,  we might be able to beat them back.  [SIGHING.] Yes, I think you're right.  - What are you doing? - What?  - I think you know. - I truly don't.  We have never had a conversation last this long  without you insulting me. Not once.  You want me to insult you?  - No! - Good.  I came to Winterfell because  I'm not the fighter I used to be.  [.]  But I'd be honored to serve under your command,  if you'll have me.  I better get back.  [DOOR OPENS.]  JORAH: Forgive me, khaleesi.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  Have you done something to offend me?  JORAH: Many things.  Long ago and long forgiven.  But you did forgive,  despite my failures.  When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand,  it broke my heart.  When I named him Hand,  I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.  You made the right choice.  I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.  I didn't.  His mouth hardly stopped moving  between Volantis and Meereen.  It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.  [CHUCKLES.]  But the mind behind all those words  He's made mistakes.  Serious mistakes.  As have we all.  He owns his  and learns from them.  You're advising me to forgive the man  who stole your position?  I am.  And one other suggestion,  if you'll allow me.  ROYCE: The moment we can get the last infantryman  out onto the field, we should shut the gates.  SANSA: Keep them open for as long as you can.  There are still people coming in from the countryside.  Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.  I thought you and I  were on the verge of agreement before.  About Ser Jaime.  Brienne has been loyal to me, always.  I trust her more than anyone.  I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.  Tyrion is a good man.  He was never anything but decent towards me.  I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.  I asked him to be my Hand  because he was good, and intelligent,  and ruthless when he had to be.  He never should have trusted Cersei.  You never should have either.  I thought he knew his sister.  Families are complicated.  Ours certainly have been.  SANSA: A sad thing to have in common.  DAENERYS: We have other things in common.  We've both known what it means to lead people  who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule.  And we've both done a damn good job of it,  from what I can tell.  And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another.  Why is that?  Your brother.  He loves you, you know that.  That bothers you.  Men do stupid things for women.  They're easily manipulated.  All my life, I've known one goal:  the Iron Throne.  Taking it back from the people  who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours.  My war was against them.  Until I met Jon.  Now I'm here, half a world away,  fighting Jon's war alongside him.  Tell me, who manipulated whom?  [SCOFFS.]  I should have thanked you the moment you arrived.  That was a mistake.  I'm here because I love your brother  and I trust him  and I know he's true to his word.  He's only the second man in my life  I can say that about.  Who was the first?  Someone taller.  [BOTH CHUCKLE.]  And what happens afterwards?  We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.  What happens then?  I take the Iron Throne.  [.]  What about the North?  It was taken from us,  and we took it back.  And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again.  What about the North?  WOLKAN: Apologies, my lady. Your Grace  What is it?  [.]  THEON: My queen.  Your sister?  She only has a few ships,  and she couldn't sail them here.  So she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead,  to take them back in your name.  But why aren't you with her?  I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa  if you'll have me.  [.]  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  Milord, we're not soldiers.  You are now.  Look, I made it through most of my years  without ever getting near a fight,  but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards.  Right outside these walls.  If I can live through that, you can live through this.  They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge.  Right that way.  Thank you.  GILLY: When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.  They're the safest place to be.  Through that archway right over there.  Thank you.  WOMAN 1: Hey, hey, who's next, lads?  WOMAN 2: Thank you, sir. Come back!  TEELA: Which way should I go?  [.]  Which way do you want to go?  All the children will be going below  when the time comes.  But both me brothers were soldiers.  I want to fight too.  That's good to hear.  I'm going to be in the crypt with my son,  and I'd feel a lot better with you down there  - to protect us. - I'm sure a lot of people would.  All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.  [HORN BLARES.]  MAN: Riders coming in!  [.]  [GRUNTS.]  [CHUCKLES.] My little crow.  I thought we'd lost you.  TORMUND: Almost.  MAN: Put them in the stables.  How did you find each other?  We met up at the Last Hearth.  The dead got there first.  The Umbers?  Fighting for the Night King now.  We had to travel around them to get here.  Whoever's not here now  is with them.  How long do we have?  Before the sun comes up tomorrow.  The big woman still here?  [.]  JON: They're coming.  MAN: Next.  JON: We have dragonglass  and Valyrian steel.  [MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY.]  JON: But there are too many of them.  Far too many.  [HORSE NEIGHS.]  Our enemy doesn't tire.  Doesn't stop.  Doesn't feel.  We can't beat them in a straight fight.  JAIME: So, what can we do?  The Night King made them all. They follow his command.  If he falls  Getting to him may be our best chance.  If that's true, he'll never expose himself.  BRAN: Yes, he will.  He'll come for me.  He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.  Why?  What does he want?  An endless night.  He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.  SAMWELL: That's what death is, isn't it?  Forgetting.  Being forgotten.  If we forget where we've been  and what we've done,  we're not men anymore.  Just animals.  Your memories don't come from books.  Your stories aren't just stories.  If I wanted to erase the world of men,  I'd start with you.  How will he find you?  His mark is on me.  He always knows where I am.  JON: We'll put you in the crypt,  - where it's safest. - BRAN: No.  We need to lure him into the open  before his army destroys us all.  I'll wait for him in the Godswood.  SANSA: You want us to use you as bait?  We're not leaving you alone out there.  He won't be. I'll stay with him.  With the Ironborn.  I took this castle from you.  Let me defend you now.  We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.  TYRION: When the time comes,  Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,  to give you the signal to light the trench.  Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own.  You'll be in the crypt.  Your Grace, I have fought before,  I can do it again.  Alongside the men and women  risking their lives.  There are thousands of them  and only one of you.  You can't fight as well as they can,  but you can think better than any of them.  You're here because of your mind.  If we survive, I'll need it.  The dragons should give us an edge in the field.  If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran.  We need to be near him.  Not too near,  or the Night King won't come.  But close enough to pursue him when he does.  Dragonfire will stop him?  I don't know.  No one's ever tried.  We're all going to die.  But at least we die together.  Let's get some rest.  Your Grace.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  TYRION: Do you need help?  No.  You've had a strange journey.  Stranger than most.  I'd like to hear about it.  It's a long story.  If only we were trapped in a castle  in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  MISSANDEI: Hello.  GREY WORM: When Daenerys takes her throne  there will be no place for us here.  I am loyal to my queen.  I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated,  but when the war is over and she has won  [WHISPERS.] do you want to grow old in this place?  [.]  [NORMALLY.] Is there nothing else you want to do,  nothing else you want to see?  Naath.  I'd like to see the beaches again.  Then I will take you there.  My people are peaceful.  We cannot protect ourselves.  My people are not peaceful.  We will protect you.  [MEN GRUNT.]  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]  MAN: Yes, sir.  Have you told her yet?  No.  Mm-hmm.  Being careful.  Biding your time.  Waiting for the perfect  And now our watch begins.  Gilly? Little Sam?  They'll be safe down in the crypt.  If you want to join them  To protect them.  Everyone seems to forget that I was  the first man to kill a White Walker.  - I've killed Thenns. - Thenn.  I've saved Gilly more than once.  I stole a considerable number of books  from the Citadel library,  survived the Fist of the First Men.  You need me out there.  Well, if that's what it's come to,  - we really are fucked. - Well, calling you \"fucked\"  wouldn't be strictly accurate.  [CHUCKLES.]  Samwell Tarly.  Slayer of White Walkers.  Lover of Ladies.  As if we needed any more signs  the world was ending.  [SIGHS.]  Think back to where we started.  [.]  Us, Grenn, Pyp.  Now it's just us three.  Last man left, burn the rest of us.  TYRION: I wish Father were here.  I would love to see the look on his face  when he realizes his two sons  are about to die defending Winterfell.  [SNORTS.]  That would be something to see.  [WIND WHISTLING.]  TYRION: I remember the first time we were here,  the first time I saw this hall.  JAIME: Mm.  You were a golden lion.  I was a drunken whoremonger.  It was all so simple.  It wasn't so simple.  I was sleeping with my sister  and you had one friend in the world  who was sleeping with his sister.  I was speaking in relative terms.  - Do you miss it? - Of course I miss it.  Well, my golden-lion days are done,  but whoremongering is still an option for you.  [SIGHS.]  It's not.  Things would be easier if it were.  The perils of self-betterment.  [DOOR OPENS.]  Oh!  My lady.  BRIENNE: Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.  We were just looking for somewhere warm to  To contemplate your imminent death.  You've come to the right place.  You want some of this piss? It's not bad.  - It's not good either. - Thank you, milord.  I don't think that's wise.  The battle might start at any moment.  Half cup.  - And you? - BRIENNE: No, thank you.  I should try and get some sleep.  JAIME: You really think any of us  are going to sleep tonight?  Join us.  All right.  Just a bit.  DAVOS: Well, what do we have here?  Ser Davos, join us.  No, not for me, thanks.  Came here for this.  [SIGHS.] I figured I could wait to die  freezing my balls off out there  or wait to die nice and warm in here.  It could be our last night in this world, you know.  Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.  [STAMMERING.] Here fighting with us.  Glad you survived Eastwatch.  Would you like a drink?  Brought my own.  They call you \"King Killer.\"  I'm sure someone does.  They call me \"Giantsbane.\"  Want to know why?  I killed a giant when I was 10.  Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.  When she woke up, you know what she did?  Suckled me at her teat for three months.  Thought I was her baby.  That's how I got so strong.  Giant's milk.  [GULPING NOISILY.]  Mm.  Maybe I will have that drink.  [TORMUND GRUNTS.]  [SIGHS.]  You never used to shut up.  Now you're just sitting there like a mute.  Guess I've changed.  What are you doing up here?  What's it look like?  No, I mean, what are you doing up here?  You joined the Brotherhood.  You went beyond the Wall with Jon.  You're here now. Why?  When was the last time  you fought for anyone but yourself?  I fought for you, didn't I?  Oh, for fuck's sake.  May as well be at a bloody wedding.  My lady.  It's good to see you again.  I'm sorry we parted the way we did.  Was he on your list?  For a little while.  That's all right.  The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same.  This is his moment.  - When light - Thoros isn't here anymore,  so I hope you're not about to give a sermon.  Because if you are,  the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times  just to watch you die when I chuck you  over this fucking wall. [CHUCKLES.]  Where are you going?  I'm not spending my final hours  with you two miserable old shits.  [.]  [GRUNTS.]  [BOWSTRING CREAKS.]  ARYA: That for me?  This'll work.  Last time you saw me,  you wanted me to come to Winterfell.  Took the long road, but  What did the Red Woman want with you?  She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.  Why your blood?  I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.  I didn't know until she told me.  Then she tied me up, stripped me down,  put leeches all over me.  Was that your first time?  No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.  Your first time with a woman.  GENDRY: What?  I I didn't I wasn't with her.  Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?  - [SCOFFS.] - Or after?  [STAMMERS INDISTINCTLY.]  - You don't remember? - [SCOFFS.]  - Yes, I was. - One?  Two?  - Twenty? - Well, I didn't keep count.  Yes, you did.  [SIGHS.]  Three.  We're probably going to die soon.  I want to know what it's like before that happens.  Arya, I  [INHALES SHARPLY.]  [BOTH CHUCKLE.]  [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY.]  [GRUNTS.]  I'm not the Red Woman.  Take your own bloody pants off.  [WIND WHISTLING.]  It's strange, isn't it?  Almost everyone here's fought the Starks  at one time or another.  And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it.  Together.  At least we'll die with honor.  I think we might live.  - [CHUCKLES.] - [SNORTS.]  [DAVOS LAUGHS.]  I I do.  How many battles have we survived between us?  Ser Davos Seaworth.

Women can't be knights.  - Why not? - Tradition.  Fuck tradition.  I don't even want to be a knight.  TORMUND: I'm no king.  But if I were,  I'd knight you 10 times over.  JAIME: You don't need a king.  Any knight can make another knight.  [CUP THUMPS.]  I'll prove it.  [SWORD RINGS.]  Kneel, Lady Brienne.  [SCOFFS.]  JAIME: Do you want to be a knight or not?  Kneel.

Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it.  But I can't really hold it upright.  Your father, he taught me how to be a man.  How to do what's right.  This is right.  It's Valyrian steel.  I'd be honored if you'd take it.  I'll wield it in his memory  to guard the realms of men.  I'll see you when it's through.  I hope we win.  - We'd better get some rest. - No, let's stay a bit longer.  We're out of wine.  How about a song?  One of you must know one.

They were married in secret.  After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,  she had a son.  Robert would have murdered the baby  if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it.  So the last thing she did  as she bled to death on her birthing bed  was give the boy to her brother  Ned Stark  to raise as his bastard.  [.]  My name  my real name  is Aegon Targaryen.

He read about their marriage at the Citadel  without even knowing what it meant.  A secret no one in the world knew  except your brother and your best friend.  Doesn't seem strange to you?  It's true, Dany.  I know it is.  If it were true,  it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen.  You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.  [HORN BLARING.]  MAN: Form up!

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS)   (MUSIC INTENSIFIES)   JON SNOW: The Night King is coming.  The dead are already here.  (YELLING) Stand your ground!", "summary": null, "review": ["10/10I know that the episode is going to have its critics, but I think it was beautiful.Upon my first viewing, I thought this episode was a load of treading water and time-filling\u2026as if they had 55 minutes to fill and they just had to stretch it out as long as possible, cramming as many characters as possible on screen to fulfill contractual obligations, including some characters practically missing from last week\u2019s show.On my second viewing, though, I came away from the episode surprisingly moved in a way that few Game of Thones episodes have moved me that weren\u2019t actually based on GRRM\u2019s writings.The empty spaces, the silences between lines; the darkness and gloom between the candles and open flames are quite haunting, as is the fleshed out \u201cJenny of Oldstones\u201d song, which is used to excellent effect.It is one of the most beautifully shot episodes that I\u2019ve seen in some time, made all the more beautiful for the relative lack of CGI effects and eye-popping moments that the show is famous for.I really liked the way that the episode kind of seeped into my emotions; I felt like I was really there in that dim, firelit hall with the wind howling outside; or smiling with Sansa and Theon as they drank to the End of the World; or up on the battlements with Jon, Sam and Edd with the black wind right in my face. I felt Dany\u2019s worry that her affair was going off the rails without knowing exactly why.While the episode is in fact basically about a bunch of people waiting around to die (as they tell us, time and time again throughout the episode), the plot does inch forward in various ways; with a couple of unanswered questions (Sansa & Dany and Jon & Dany scenes in particular, both scenes full of subtlety and honestly wonderful acting by the principles.)The trial of Jaime of course is a bit hand-waved: the show needs Jaime to fight the White Walkers and it will need Jaime later on in the season to bring the Cersei story arc to conclusion; but it was well played and well-integrated into the overall tapestry of the episode: by proving to the court Jaime\u2019s honour, Brienne earns her spurs\u2026This wholly uncynical development doesn\u2019t really feel like GRRM\u2019s rather punk notions of fantasy, but it is a moment that I, as an audience member, genuinely enjoyed. And Gwendolyn plays the scene of her knighthood with beauty and grace.What stands out in this episode to me, is the reactions and the expressions on various actors faces: Sansa\u2019s guardedness when talking to Daenerys; and the unguarded joy and fear and sorrow she shows when reuniting with Theon, the foster brother who saved her life. Dany\u2019s open and frank friendliness and uncertain haughtiness as she withdraws her hands from Sansa\u2019s; Jon\u2019s chuckle upon Sam\u2019s joke at Dolorous Edd\u2019s expense ; Brienne breaking down into tearful laughter; Bran\u2019s piercing gaze; and Dany\u2019s multi-emotional reactions to hearing the news that Jon is the rightful heir.These were all moments that floored me without dialogue.In the end, in the second viewing, once my cynical side was appeased, I found the episode one of my favorite of the episodes where nothing really happens action-wise, and there have been many in this long series or serial (depending on what side your on.)Bryan Cogman, who wrote the episode, retains his position as the best of the writers of Game of Thrones, able to catch in a few lines the essence of the characters and their innermost thoughts while somehow managing to suggest hidden depths and not-easily defined emotional themes without resorting to the rather cheesy, facile heavy metal cliches that Benioff and Weiss tend to fall back on.Like the ghosts in the song of Jenny of Oldstones and like the characters themseles desperately on the brink of death, I never wanted to leave this episode.Which is not to say I don\u2019t have some \u2026observations:I\u2019m not exactly sure if \u201cdown in the crypts\u201d is the best place for the women and babies to be when you are fighting against an evil ice wizard who can raise the dead. Just saying. I can see that plan backfiring. I have a better idea! Keep them in Davos\u2019 Soup Kitchen making soup, I say.\u00a0I bet the White Walkers don\u2019t react well at all to a nice, steaming hot bowl of chicken soup thrown right in their faces!! Has anybody ever tried fighting them with hot soup? I doubt it! It\u2019s worth a try, dammit! They ought to be filling the catapults with soup. Some general, Brienne.When Bran asks Jaime \u201chow do you know there\u2019s going to be an afterwards?\u201d Nicholas does one of his patented \u201cscalp movement\u201d reactions.\u00a0If there is ever a drinking game with Game of Thrones, that should be one of the drinking triggers. Along with Cersei\u2019s iconic eyebrow, Brienne\u2019s furious frown and Dany\u2019s ten yard stare.I must say the fact that Davos has set up a soup kitchen kind of amused me, but it made for some nice scenes.I felt sorry for Dany a couple of times when Jon kind of brushed her off: not knowing what he\u2019s going through, I\u2019m sure she was wondering why she was acting like a passive aggressive girl. Well played, Emilia.The scene with the Hound and Beric \u201cDead already in the books\u201d Dondarrion was a bit pointless but then\u2026.AAAAGGGGHHHH. MY EYES!!!!!!! Maisie gets naked!!! I\u2019m sorry, but she will always be a ten year old girl to me! Good scene, I particularly like the shot afterwards during the \u201cJenny of Oldstones\u201d montage with her looking pensively into the darkness while Joe Dempsie snores away. But still. Ew.Cogman really got Tormund right this episode. Show Tormund has always been entertaining, but Cogman finally gives him the pitch-perfect tone of ridiculousness that he\u2019s always needed.Cogman also absolutely nailed Dolorous Edd (finally!) when Edd says (I paraphrase) \u201cSam the Slayer of White Walkers and lover of the Ladies. The world really must be ending.)Finally the song was just the moody centerpiece this episode needed neatly sewing all the characters and their emotions together with it\u2019s moody melody.", "There are legitimate issues in this episode, especially with the pacing, but boy does it drop a bunch of super-massive revelations that are just as relevant to the books as the show.Straight from the outset, we see Daenerys in her full-on power trip. Her advisers should basically be asking to hear what she\u2019s saying, because it sounds so much like Viserys\u2019s rantings from season one. Also, we are given a hint about how much influence the obviously insane Viserys had on his sister as she was growing up, given that they\u2019ve had detailed discussions about what they\u2019re going to do to Jaime when they \u2018have him in grasp\u2019.Very important here is the transformation that Daenerys has wrought in the Great Hall of Winterfell. With Jon and Sansa in charge, there were long tables with one row front and one row in the back, so as to accommodate the maximum number of people. That indicates a consultative approach to decision-making which we did see from both Jon and Sansa.Now though, with Daenerys seemingly numero uno, the design of the Great Hall has just a couple tables for the high nobility and everyone else stands before Daenerys as a supplicant. Small detail, but the Devil resides in these.During Jaime\u2019s \u2018trial\u2019, there are multiple instances where Daenerys literally goes full power-trip. There is a massive difference between seeing power as a responsibility and relishing exerting that power over someone in a vulnerable position. Jaime had no reason to come to Winterfell, none.He could have collected the two Lannister armies, gone to Casterly Rock and had a grand old time with no one left to oppose him.Instead, he came to Winterfell, knowing the reception he\u2019d get, solely to honour his promise. Brienne sees that and so that does Sansa. As for Jon, he doesn\u2019t care about Jaime\u2019s past, though Bran correctly guesses that he\u2019d murder Jaime if he found out what Jaime did to Bran.Jaime straight-up furnishes all the intel he has, no games and no leverage.The power trip is back and she\u2019s doubling down.Oh Tyrion\u2026 What have these showrunners done to you? Once the brightest man in Westeros, now reduced to being publicly shamed for making uncharacteristic mistakes.He\u2019s right. They were at war. War isn\u2019t about being honorable, someone should have told Robb Stark. War is about surviving at any cost.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau putting in some excellent character work here. All he does is manipulate micro-expressions on his face, perfectly conveying the heartbreak Jaime feels over being trusted by someone other than Cersei, something he lived his whole life thinking to be impossible. Like Sophie Turner and Sansa, Jaime was a role that Coster-Waldau was born to play.At this point, it\u2019s not even subtle anymore. If the show doesn\u2019t do the \u2018Daenerys as the Mad Queen\u2019 story arc, then it would be mind-numbingly stupid to portray her character as being this annoyed at Sansa\u2019s suggestion at what should happen.I simultaneously love and hate this scene. In this scene, Grey Worm is the slave soldier who has won himself a place among nobility and Jaime is the one born into nobility who has recently learned some humility. But, the way this scene is framed, I hate Grey Worm for shoving Widow\u2019s Wail into Jaime\u2019s chest. If Jaime had his sword hand, no amount of training since childhood would have saved Grey Worm. Wonderful framing once again from David Nutter.If it was confusing why Tyrion would turn around and say that Varys or Jorah might replace him soon, this scene is why. Daenerys makes sure to glance in their general direction when she knows that Tyrion is watching, to implant the suggestion in his mind. Tyrion, being brilliant, naturally picks up on it straightaway.If the Arya-Gendry arc seemed cut for time last episode, this time around, there\u2019s arguably too much time given to it. How good is Gendry as a smith? He\u2019s reforged what is essentially a form of volcanic glass into a weapon that can cleave wood.I\u2019ll get to their sex scene here and dispose of it. Maybe this is just me, but it was really, really awkward watching the part where Arya disrobes. They don\u2019t go full-frontal which is a damned mercy, mostly because we\u2019ve watched this character on this show as a child and yes, she\u2019s a grown woman by Westerosi standards now and there\u2019s always the hint of an Arya-Gendry romance in the books, but still, this sequence is something that, for me, might have worked better as an implication rather than a visually realized scene.This scene.And Jaime\u2019s reaction. Given by what we see later, there\u2019s a pretty good chance now that Bran knows that he\u2019s going to die in the Winterfell battle. That might be why he set the wheels in motion for R+L=J to be revealed as soon as Jon returned. There is all the reason to believe that there is a longer conversation here, but we aren\u2019t told what it is.We can infer something from Jaime\u2019s subsequent actions. After this talk, he meets Tyrion, his only relative in this gathering, and then spots Brienne and offers to fight under her. Could it be that he\u2019s been told that he too is going to die and he can save Brienne and maybe more if he fought and died at the left flank? Personally, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to die at Winterfell, but this and Bran\u2019s other scene with Tyrion don\u2019t give me any confidence.Pure bullshit from Tyrion, proving that his blind spot for family is just as big as Tywin\u2019s. Cersei fooled Jaime more than anyone else.Important detail: All the outward-facing ramparts of the outer walls have been lined with dragonglass spikes. Common sense strategy, and will prove useful in taking down the first few waves of wights. Once the spikes are buried in wight gore, then it\u2019ll be a free-for-all.In the trailer, I postulated that this expression might due to her mourning someone\u2019s death. Turns out, it was just because big ol\u2019 meanie Sansa didn\u2019t agree with her to burn Jaime.The power trip is back. Because we missed it so much for the two minutes we weren\u2019t seeing it.Here is the mask of civility. We will see it come off, come back on and finally be thrown out the window in this sequence of scenes.Sansa puts a pin in her \u2018blame Tyrion\u2019 balloon. Daenerys is ultimately the monarch and Tyrion only makes suggestions, he doesn\u2019t make the decisions.Mask off, but only momentarily.Mask back on.It is here that she overplays her hand, with the flattery.I absolutely adore Sophie Turner\u2019s acting here. How she manages to pack so much contempt into a smile, I\u2019ll never know. Sansa here is actually pitying Daenerys, because the latter is using tactics that the former discovered to spot years ago from Cersei. Sansa is the real \u2018younger, more beautiful queen\u2019 of the valonquar prophecy. This sequence should be all the proof that is needed.Sansa leaning forward here is a ploy, she lures Daenerys into a trap. Daenerys thinks that she\u2019s swayed Jon\u2019s uppity sister to her side, and Sansa knows that, and suckers her in. How she\u2019s grown\u2026And there\u2019s the trap. Sansa puts Daenerys on the spot, regarding the status of the North in Daenerys\u2019s hypothetical rule.The mask has left the building. At least, she doesn\u2019t resort to threats, or she would have if Theon hadn\u2019t just returned.Again, masterful framing from Nutter. We know what Theon has done and what it has cost the Starks. But, here, what we\u2019re seeing is Theon\u2019s core and lifelong desire be fulfilled. All he ever wanted was to be accepted and embraced as a Stark, just like Jon. Not for nothing that Sansa is the current head of the Stark family and he immediately volunteers for the most risky assignment, protecting Bran on the ground without Valyrian steel and dragons. I think the show might be killing him off in the next episode. To me, his arc is complete. He saved Yara and has been accepted into both the Stark and Greyjoy families. I think he\u2019s a goner. Gilly and Davos\u2019s scenes were both a framing device to see the war from the commoners\u2019s perspective and a moment\u2019s respite from seeing one major character after another.Beric, Edd and Tormund arrive at Winterfell, sidestepping the undead army. According to them, the army will arrive by daybreak the next day. The problem I had with pacing was with everything after this, because a lot seems to happen in the time remaining.The big planning meet-up is one of the biggest cascade of revelations ever.Some of the biggest ones are:The Long Night is cyclical, since there have been other Ravens, and none have apparently managed to permanently beat the Night King.No one has ever tried dragons against the Others.The true motive of the Others might just have been revealed. Not only do they want to transform the world in their image, but they want to erase even the memory of anything other than themselves.Bran is the world\u2019s living identity. He\u2019s truly a demigod.Again, we don\u2019t know what Bran said, but after this chat, Tyrion is next seen talking and drinking with Jaime, who has also recently had a chat with Bran. I think Bran knows that he is going to die in the upcoming battle and is making sure everyone knows what they need to know.The Night\u2019s Watch reunion. And of course, Ghost, who shows up in an episode with zero dragon action. I have a very bad feeling about Ghost now that Jon is bonded with Rhaegal. Don\u2019t you fucking kill him off, David and Dan!Prime material from \u2018Dolorous\u2019 Edd here. Lover of Ladies, indeed\u2026Remembering the fallen.I\u2019m not going to go too deep into the fireside interaction, because that is pure filler material, with the exception of one thing.Brienne lies as a reflex, because she has been mocked for wanting to be a knight. It is all that she has ever wanted. Also, huge revelation alert, because Jaime calls her a \u2018Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u2019. That title was last used for Lord Commander Duncan The Tall, whose shield turns up in the armory of Tarth in the books, implying that she might be a descendant of his, explaining her unusual height and strength. To me, this was a confirmation that Brienne is a descendant of Ser Duncan.Lyanna Mormont schools her cousin in bravery in the face of insurmountable odds. Jorah fled his potential execution and became a disgraced sellsword and a spy, whereas his cousin isn\u2019t even willing to hide, let alone flee.This is Jenny\u2019s song, named after Princess Jenny of Oldstones. This song comes up in the books when the Ghost of High Heart, possibly one of the Children of the Forest, asks for this song to be played over and over again. The Ghost is the same woods witch who issued the original prophecy of the Prince that was Promised, and told Aegon V on the show that he needed to allow the marrriage of Aerys and Rhaella. This is another hint that the show is going to the fulfillment of that prophecy.Barristan Selmy told her these things. And there we have it folks, R+L=J is officially out and about.This is the beginning of her downward spiral. She knows here that she\u2019s not alone in this world, that she has one living relative, and in true Targaryen fashion, they\u2019re doing it. And, all she feels is panic and horror, because the only thing she truly loves, the Iron Throne, is suddenly so very far away.The power trip is back. And now Jon, who was apparently the love of her life in what she told Sansa, is facing her ire. Notice the transition here. She starts, standing alongside Jon, bathed in candlelight. But here, as she retreats from the truth, half her face is literally shrouded in darkness now and she\u2019s leaning towards the darkness. The foreshadowing isn\u2019t even subtle anymore.The continued interplay of light and dark on her face. And now she\u2019s properly angry too, that a male heir has surfaced. She loved Jon because she saw him as controllable and someone who was no threat to her.This group of Others is more notable by the fact that their leader isn\u2019t among them. The Night King can see the future too and no doubt he has a counter-strategy for the trap that Bran has baited with his own life.Can\u2019t wait for the next episode, naturally directed by Miguel Sapochnik.", "Spoilers for Episode 2 (Recap and Review)At least we\u2019ll die with honor. Ser Brienne of TarthI think we might live. Hand of the Queen, Tyrion LannisterThis episode continued the string of reunions. Jaime, Theon, Dolores Edd, Beric Dondarrion, Tormund Giantsbane all hunker down and wait for the Night King. The episode decided not to linger overmuch on key plot points:A Speedy TrialDaenerys finally has the Kingslayer under her thumb. Only Sansa seems as upset as she. They bond over their mutual outrage at his aggression toward their fathers. Brienne vouches for Jaime, which settles the matter for Sansa, who trusts Brienne with her life. Tyrion tries to do the same, but Daenerys is fed up with Tyrion\u2019s poor advice on Cersei, so she won\u2019t listen. When she speaks to the Warden of the North (former King in the North Jon Snow), he replies: \u201cWe need every man we can get.\u201dI expected more dialogue and drama, but the showrunners are streamlining storylines so that we get a good battle. Did I hear a collective howl when Bran uttered: \u201cThe things we do for love.\u201d Folks, you were correct. Bran is not angry. Bran doesn\u2019t consider himself to be Bran. But Jaime apologizes and wonders how things will be afterwards. Bran isn\u2019t sure there will be an afterwards. The Bran/Jaime talk felt anti-climatic\u2014a bit like Jon\u2019s resurrection in Season 6. For book readers, this is as close to the Lady Stoneheart arc as we are going to get.Tyrion Keeps His Day JobI would have fired Tyrion as my Hand, but I don\u2019t have a Jorah reminding me to forgive. Yes, Jorah would have been Dany\u2019s hand if he hadn\u2019t betrayed her, if he hadn\u2019t gotten greyscale and so on. But he would have been a far worse Hand than Tyrion. She decided to keep him for his mind. She also doesn\u2019t have anyone better. Jorah doesn\u2019t command respect in Westeros. Tyrion is Tywin\u2019s son. But Dany\u2019s forgiveness felt contrived. This episode felt like too many characters didn\u2019t act like themselves. At least Tyrion got to sit around the fire and talk with Tormund, Davos, Podrick, Jaime and Brienne while Tormund entertained the lot with his Giantsbane name, and Podrick sang a mournful \u201cJenny of Oldstones\u201d song.Can We Be Friends?Daenerys reaches out to Sansa, talking about their mutual role in commanding as women. They speak almost like friends. Daenerys makes it clear that she has come for the Iron Throne. Sansa wants no part of it. She wants an independent North. Daenerys snatches her hand away. I sighed. Did Jon not tell her anything about Northerners? Did she really think Sansa would want to submit to her rule? Daenerys says to Sansa: \u201cI cannot help but feel we are at odds with one another.\u201d And that will remain as long as Daenerys assumes her belief in her right to rule remains absolute\u2014above all other considerations. Others are not going to share her ideas.Theon\u2019s return confirms that Daenerys will not be able to control how others feel about Sansa. Theon is allied with Dany yes, but he came back for the Starks. Sansa rewards him with a grateful embrace that reminds us of her visit to Castle Black when she met up with Jon. He directs his request to fight to Sansa, not Daenerys. Sansa has earned the love of her people, including Theon. Daenerys is appreciated for the good she has brought, but she is not loved.Ser BrienneThat was a nice touch\u2014having Jaime knight her. Here are the vows from the show:In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just. In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent. Arise, Brienne of Tarth, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Brienne's moving momentI had tears in my eyes. Even if Jaime were to die in his first five minutes of battle, he has come full circle\u2014a return to his knighthood. I wonder if Brienne will become a Lord Commander of the Kingsguard/Queensguard like her ancestor, Ser Duncan the Tall. Yes, this was fan service, and this particular fan loved it.What Else?I saw a white furry dot with red eyes. Was that Ghost? Is that the best you can do, D and D?Jon Snow, Dolores Edd and Samwell Tarly are the remnants of the Night\u2019s Watch. I enjoyed that bit of bonding.Arya, the Hound and Beric Dondarrion reunite, with the Hound threatening to chuck Beric over the Winterfell walls if he preaches a sermon about the Lord of Light. We understand, Sandor\u2014no one was in the mood to hear about the Lord\u2019s will.Speaking of Arya\u2014 I\u2019m glad Arya and Gendry got together for some pre-Night King romance. It was weird to see Maisie Williams out of her clothes. Arya wanted to have a sexual experience before she faced death. It made sense, but felt so cliche. Our little assassin has grown up.Grey Worm and Missandei want to go back to Naath, Missandei\u2019s home. Will they? Don\u2019t bet your paycheck or even your Starbucks coffee money.Theon wants to protect Bran in the godswood as Bran waits for the Night King, hoping to lure him in an ambush. I think Theon will give his life to save Bran.Oh, I Almost ForgotJon sprung the news of his true birth on Daenerys when she went to visit him in the crypts. That was well done as Daenerys struggled to find words to express her regret at Lyanna\u2019s fate, not knowing that her dead older brother loved and married Lyanna. I was glad that Lyanna\u2019s sacrifice was emphasized as she made sure her baby was safe with her brother Ned, while she bled to death, entrusting him to sully his honor out of love for her. And Daenerys realized that Jon is the male Targaryen heir. Before they can talk about what this means, the White Walkers arrive.I don\u2019t envy Daenerys. She loves Jon, but a part of her is going to want him not to press that claim. He is walking out to fight death itself. Will a part of her wish for Jon\u2019s death, then hate herself for such a thing? Which part of her will win as Jon commands his troops to throw everything they have at the Night King.Some of this episode was tiresome. Some of it was cliche. But God, it made me want to see the Battle of Winterfell so badly. I cannot wait until next week.", "Very disappointed. Needless to say, my comments contain spoilers for those who haven\u2019t watched it.Now, a week later, I have just watched Episode 3. I\u2019ll put my comments about 8.3 at the bottom.In both episodes 8.1 and 8.2, there was very little plot progression. The story seemed to be, let\u2019s bring most of the main characters together, and have them like each other.There was very little advance of the story. I had expected that each of the season 8 episodes would be a complete movie, as the producers had promised. But nothing happened, except each character showing up and getting the others to like him/her.At the end of episode 1, a hooded guy appeared, and I assumed it was Jamie. After dragging it out, he took off his hood for the big reveal, and (surprise?) it was Jamie. That was the dramatic moment that ended 8.1.We knew from last season that Jon was the \u201crightful\u201d heir to the iron throne. (Does anyone in a democracy like the US or India think \u201crightful\u201d heir is legitimate?) It took the whole episode to tell him this. And then it took the whole episode 2 before he got around to telling Dany.Did you notice how often they said that the crypt would be the safe place. I think they must have said that 4 times, maybe more. They should have said it only once, to set us up, but saying it four times makes me think that all of the characters are very stupid. Doesn\u2019t anybody realize that all those dead bodies will rise from their tombs as soon as the White Walkers arrive?We have to wait to 8.3 for the White Wakers to get to Winterfell? (At least I hope they will finally arrive; as I write this, 8.3 is 5 days in the future.)What I had expected was a great battle in 8.1 of the wights (the official name of the dead) and the north. Maybe it would end with the dead dragon enflaming Jon and Dany. Great end of episode 8.1. Then in 8.2, we would learn that they both survived, unburnt. Dany looks at Jon (who, like her, is now naked) and realizes that he is a Targaryen. Even so, it isn\u2019t obvious how that happened. They slowly pick together the pieces and jointing figure out what must have happened. Then Sam arrives to explain it all, but they already know.The dead rise from the crypt and we see Ned once again. Arya kills him with her Valyrian dagger, and in horror at having done this, swears she will never kill again. And we think she won\u2019t, but later she makes an exception (in 8.4) when she sees Cersei. She kills Cercei, then she takes on Cercei\u2019s face, to take control of Cersei\u2019s troops to help fight the dead. Eventually (sadly) she, in this guise, will be killed by Jamie who thinks he is killing his sister. That would be 8.4. (Maybe she is later brought back to life, but I suspect not.)That would have been an set of episodes 8.1 and 8.2 with a moving plot! I fear that now that George R.R. Martin is no longer writing the story line, that the high level we have grown to expect is sadly diminished.And now I doubt that we will have the grand finale that I had hoped for, one in which Sam gets a message to the White Walkers, and then bravely marches into their camp, surrounded by raving deads (the wites) who are striving to kill him but are restrained by the White Walker magic. The White Walkers ask Sam if he has indeed figured out how to cure them, and he says he isn\u2019t sure but that he read something that makes him think that maybe he can but he can\u2019t guarantee it\u2026. One White Walker takes a chance and Sam stabs him just so carefully with dragon glass, simulating the way that the Walkers were made in the first place by the Children of the Forest. Then he shatters it when it is in place in the White Walker\u2019s heart, and the White Walker turns back into a person. A large number of the dead instantly crumble and fall\u2014those created by and enslaved to this particular White Walker. Another White Walker goes up to Sam and asks to be cured. Soon the White Walkers are all men again, and all the dead are dead again, and Sam, looking up at the sky, says, \u201cThe Grand Maesters of the Citadel were wrong! It is not going to be a long winder! Spring has begun!\u201d And Episode 8.6 ends as some cherry trees sprout blossoms.Note added on April 28, after watching 8.3.It wasn\u2019t just disappointing; it was terrible. I almost wish I had not watched it. None of the characters did anything intelligent. Mostly they just fought bravely and boringly. The battle with the dead lasted about 1 hour and 15 minutes. (The episode lasted 1.5 hours.). It wasn\u2019t anything more than a zombie battle. The living were losing, until finally at the end one of the major characters manages to stab the top White Walker with a fatal knife (I think it was Valyrian steel, but maybe it was dragon glass). The White Walker dies, and all of the dead return to being dead.Why take an hour and a half to accomplish this? Nothing else in the story advanced. OK, a few secondary characters were killed, including the Red Witch. (Who cares?) Somehow most of the main characters survived, even though thousands of others died. They appeared to have been lucky. Deus ex machina.Even the special effects were boring. They entire episode took place at night, and most everything was hidden in darkness. That\u2019s very convenient for saving money on special effects, but it takes away all of the potential wow.Fortunately for me, I am a Warriors basketball fan (my granddaughter danced at two games, once pre-game and once at halftime). Most experts expected them to fall to the surging Houston Rockets, but the Warriors won. So the day isn\u2019t a complete loss.Sigh. I waited two years for this Game of Thrones season. I rewatched 7 seasons in preparation, and my judgement was that they were truly excellent. My disappointment so far matches my disappointment at the sorry ending of the series LOST.", "Late to the party again. But I do like to party. Let\u2019s begin -Wow, they\u2019re not wasting any time with this. To Jaime\u2019s trial right away.And it goes as expected\u2026. except, I have two problems with it:Why the hell did Bran butt in with \u201cthe things you do for love\u201d only to not follow it up with anything? Just to scare Jaime? That doesn\u2019t seem like Bran.I have to say this \u2014 I expected more from this. It just felt undercut.Jon is acting cagey with Dany. Honestly, I expected them to talk sooner. Not only is Jon acting childish this season, he\u2019s also acting like a girl. I won\u2019t talk to you and I won\u2019t tell you why. What\u2019s worse? It feels like they did this just to give it the last slot in the episode. Leave us hanging again. Well.. OK.Yes, Arya seems to be demanding a lot from Gendry. There is definitely something in the brew.Arya is asking Gendry about the White Walkers. Shouldn\u2019t she be asking Jon? Have they really not talked at all? Does Arya really want to ask the one guy who had half an encounter with the White Walkers before running back, and not her own brother who has faced them twice? Hard to swallow.Jaime meets Bran in the Godswood. And Bran being cryptic again. Does he really not know what comes afterwards, or is he just teasing us? I am not sure.Tyrion and Jaime. I like this pair.Brienne and Jaime. Of course.Tyrion\u2019s stupidity exposed. And yet, for some reason, Jorah is backing him as the smartest man? I can see why Sansa would say that. She\u2019s seen Tyrion in his glory days. But Jorah? Tyrion has been nothing but a fool ever since he joined Daenerys. I\u2019m sorry, but complimenting Tyrion\u2019s mind like that seems like an oversell at this point. Plot convenience.Dany and Sansa. Yeah, this looks interesting. A lot to unpack here -Royce sees Dany, but seeks Sansa\u2019s permission before leaving. Gives Dany only courtesy. Sansa: 1. Dany: 0.\u201cHe never should have trusted her.\u201d Dany throws Tyrion under the bus. \u201cYou never should have either.\u201d Sansa gives Dany a smack down. Sansa: 2. Dany: 0.Dany says \u201cI thought you knew his sister.\u201d Is she implying Sansa is wrong about Cersei? Or am I misreading something here?And here they go about having complicated families again. I know Dany and Sansa haven\u2019t talked about this before. But this talk about troubling families is getting stale now. Could be just me though.\u201c\u2026who aren\u2019t inclined to accept a woman\u2019s rule.\u201d Funny enough, Sansa has never faced that issue. So Dany\u2019s attempt at an amicable opening falls flat. And Dany goes on to praise Sansa, although not without praising herself too. Trying to find more common ground, but again, falls flat because I am not sure Sansa is fond of Dany\u2019s way of ruling.Dany is animated. Sansa has a poker face. Sansa, oh Sansa! Yeah!Dany goes in with another misinformed statement - \u201c\u2026 taking it back from people who destroyed my family and almost destroyed yours\u2026\u201dTo be fair, a significant part of the Stark family was destroyed by the Targaryens. Does Dany know nothing about what the Mad King did to Starks? She doesn\u2019t even make an effort to apologise to Sansa for it. And Sansa seems to be judging her for it.\u201cNow I\u2019m here, fighting Jon\u2019s war\u2026\u201d Okay, that\u2019s it. Dany calling it Jon\u2019s war might just be the stupidest thing she\u2019s ever said so far. Can we give her negative points for this?Sansa lures Dany in, and drops the hammer on her. Stay out of the north! Dany finds herself helpless again. And it\u2019s great to watch their expressions. I have to say, Sophie has come a long way, just like Sansa. What acting!Dany sees an ally again \u2014 Theon. And turns out that Sansa has a much more personal connection to him. *hug* Boy, does Dany look out of place here.Davos serves a girl with half her face scarred. Shireen callback. Coz that\u2019s the only way to show depth in Davos? Why did they need to do this?Tormund and Edd are back! We\u2019re getting closer! Fuuuckkk.The Night King is after the three eyed ravens more than anything else. Why? Is it because they can see the past? What else could it be? This is new. This is interesting.Dany went from calling Tyrion stupid to wanting to save his mind. All within a day. Huh?Did Tyrion and Bran even talk?Missandei has had enough. She wants to go home. Will Dany giver her a ship (S7)?Jon and Sam on the parapets look very similar to when they spoke before the Battle of Castle Black. Nice!GHOST! Finally!Wine party in Winterfell. Okay.Arya wants some. Oh well. As off as it looks at first, I think it\u2019s about time we acknowledge that she\u2019s a woman now.Sam gives Heartsbane to Jorah. So Jorah does finally get a Valyrian steel sword. Interesting.Jon picks the best time to break the news to Dany. Perfect, just perfect.Dany questions Jon about the legitimacy of the claim. Fair point.Jon assures her. Understandable.Dany immediately questions the succession. And Jon looks disturbed. He\u2019s thinking back on Sam\u2019s words, isn\u2019t he?And. They\u2019re here.All in all, I think we\u2019re done with reunions. We\u2019re done with waiting for people to find things out. Most things are in the open now. And all that matters now is the living and the dead.Anyone psyched for some dragon vs dragon fight? I know I am!", "S8E2: As usual, part review and part recap:We have a title now: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. Love it.(We already knew the big battle was in the third episode. Were people really expecting it to fully start now?!)We go right to Jaime standing in front of Dany, Sansa and Jon. This unfolded more or less the way I imagined it, but I really wish that there\u2019d been a bit more meat to it and that the wildfire plot had come out. I hope it does eventually. It\u2019s too good to hold onto.I feel like they played \u201cgotcha\u201d here with Dany and Sansa, with Sansa seeming to agree with Dany at first. Will they get along after this?! Tyrion and Brienne both stand up for Jaime, as I would have expected, and it looks like they probably did hold onto Brienne in the last episode for this moment.I think it was fiendish to not only have Sansa go along with Dany at first but to have her to change her mind after Brienne vouches for Jaime. If Sansa had changed her mind just because Dany wanted Jaime dead, it\u2019d look petty. This makes it look like she does have faith in Brienne.Dany asks what the \u201cwarden of the north\u201d thinks of this. The way she asks, not only does it come across as if she\u2019s telling Jon to rein Sansa in, but also like she\u2019s trying to tell Jon that his authority trumps his sister\u2019s. \u201cAre you gonna let her get by with this?!\u201dJon says they need Jaime, so backs Sansa. Dany goes with this but you can tell she hates it.Dany stands up first but Sansa leaves first. Dany\u2019s pissed at Tyrion for being either a \u201ctraitor or a fool.\u201d She\u2019s not really wrong? Dany gives Tyrion a warning that he\u2019s gonna be sacked unless he changes things around.Back to the dragonglass forges. The weapons are coming along nicely. Arya shows up and is very openly ogling him, which is delightful. We find out the crypt is where the non-fighters will be. Gendry tells Arya he\u2019s fought the Others and she starts asking what they\u2019re like. Arya seems a bit too eager to fight for Gendry\u2019s liking. Arya shows him she knows what she\u2019s doing. Rawr.Bran\u2019s at the weirwood and Jaime ends up being his mystery guest. Jaime apologizes to Bran! It\u2019s Jaime\u2019s turn to find out Bran\u2019s a weirdo. Bran tells Jaime he didn\u2019t out him for the window-pushing because he knows Jaime can help them.Tyrion wanders through the yard, seeing everyone making preparation. Jaime\u2019s welcome at Winterfell is uh less than friendly.Jaime asks Tyrion if he\u2019s sure about Dany and points out that Dany isn\u2019t sure of Tyrion. I think it\u2019s interesting that Jaime frames uneasiness about Dany in terms of how she treats Tyrion, and not how she treats Jaime.Jaime at least doesn\u2019t think Cersei was lying about the baby. Tyrion gives Jaime what is honestly a pretty big putdown: He knew what Cersei was and loved her anyway. Tyrion already looks better in this episode than he did in the first one. It\u2019s like he does better when he\u2019s down than he does when he\u2019s confident.\u201cWe\u2019re going to die \u2026 at Winterfell.\u201d We get the \u201cgirl\u2019s mouth around my cock\u201d story again. Jaime\u2019s heard it too!Jaime sees Brienne from the Winterfell battlements as men train outside. There\u2019s Pod. Jaime is deferential and polite to Brienne and compliments her on Podrick\u2019s progress. We find out Brienne is leading part of the forces.Here\u2019s Jaime and Brienne\u2019s \u2026 reckoning? Jaime says he\u2019s not a good fighter anymore, but wants Brienne to be his commander. This is probably the closest we\u2019re gonna get to \u201cI love you\u201d for a while. It\u2019s poignant and meaningful to both of them.Dany looking upset. Jorah pops in. He admits that he didn\u2019t like Tyrion but defends him to Dany. Jorah alludes to some other suggestion and here\u2019s Dany finding Royce and Sansa in the library.Sansa stands when she sees Dany. No one\u2019s going to accuse her of insubordination. Royce looks to Sansa when Dany says she wants them to speak alone, instead of beating it immediately. He does bow to Dany on the way out.Dany has this sickly tight smile on her face and her hands are clasped. She tells Sansa she thought they were in agreement over Jaime and makes a dig at her advisers. Sansa says Tyrion is good.Here\u2019s that damn line. The captioning in the preview was wrong and Dany really does say, \u201cHE never should have trusted Cersei.\u201d Rather than let Dany throw Tyrion under the bus, Sansa throws it back at her \u2014 \u201cYou never should have either.\u201dDany\u2019s trying to make this a \u201cgirl power\u201d thing. \u201cWe\u2019ve both a damn good job of it from what I can tell.\u201d Can you really?Dany asks Sansa what her beef is. Sansa tells Dany she knows Jon loves her, men do stupid things for women and are easily manipulated. Dany\u2019s mad at it being implied that she\u2019s manipulating Jon.When the feminist line doesn\u2019t work, Dany changes tack and goes to the angle of, \u201cI\u2019m doing this against the people who screwed both of us over!\u201dOH MY GOD. Dany tells Sansa she put aside the Iron Throne to come fight Jon\u2019s war \u201calongside him\u201d AGAINST FUCKING ICE MONSTERS and asks Sansa \u201cwho manipulated whom.\u201d Sansa has this open-mouthed look like she can\u2019t believe it, then says she should have thanked Dany when she arrived.Dany says she\u2019s here because she loves Jon. Which is all well and good except \u2026 that\u2019s not really the point is it?! Jon\u2019s putting on like Dany\u2019s doing this because she accepts her sense of duty and \u2026 that\u2019s \u2026 not \u2026 why \u2026 she\u2019s \u2026 doing it? Help?Sansa asks what happens afterward. Dany takes the Iron Throne. And what about the North? Sansa asks. Dany jerks her hand back like Sansa\u2019s electrified, then Wolkan walks in and interrupts them. This all looks like Sansa was dangling something positive \u2014 her sort-of apology for not thanking Dany when she arrived \u2014 in preparation for this question. Like with Jaime, it looked like they might be on the verge of an accord, but: NOPE.Wolkan greets Sansa first but it\u2019s Dany who asks \u201cWhat is it?\u201dHey, Theon\u2019s here! Someone else for whom Sansa can vouch. Dany asks why Theon isn\u2019t with Yara. Theon says he wants to fight for Winterfell, and asks it of Sansa directly. Sansa rushes to hug him.Here\u2019s Winterfell\u2019s soup line. Davos is trying to get morale up and \u2026 not doing too well, but he\u2019s trying. Gilly\u2019s doing her part too, leading non-fighters over to the crypts.A little girl tells Davos she wants to fight, and Gilly manages to talk her into going into the crypt with her. Poor little kid.Here\u2019s the Castle Black and Eastwatch contingents down from Last Hearth. They give Jon the bad news about the Umbers and Tormund tells Jon that it\u2019s pretty much zero hour now.Tormund asks if Brienne is there. My lord.Jon is giving a voiceover as we see Winterfell making preparation. Then we see Jon and pretty much every major player around the table. Interestingly, Jon is flanked by Sansa and Arya while Dany is catty-corner and between Jorah and Varys. Jaime\u2019s there, with Brienne. Sam asks the big question, namely WHY is all this happening? Sam makes a rather eloquent rumination on death, while the camera flashes to Dany (who killed Sam\u2019s family) and Arya (who was literally part of an assassin-death cult). Bran says he want to lure the Night King to the godswood and Theon offers to stay with him.Dany orders Tyrion to stay in the crypt because his brain is worth more than he is as a soldier. Jon seems to think they\u2019ll be using the dragons to take on the Night King.Tormund manages to be morbid and hit on Brienne at the same time.As Jaime was Bran\u2019s guest in the godswood, Tyrion stays behind to speak with him in the library. Tyrion says he wants to hear about Bran\u2019s journey. Is this \u2026 going where it could go?Grey Worm and Missandei meet up in the Winterfell yard. Missandei tries to tell some girls hello and they bail on her. Kind of sad. Grey Worm says he and Missandei have no place in Dany\u2019s world after she wins. When he says \u201cthis place,\u201d does he mean Westeros or Winterfell? I\u2019m pretty sure this is telling us that Grey Worm is going to die. It\u2019s always the \u201cwhen this is over\u201d bit that does it. I give these two grief for being a bit dull, but unless I miss my guess, this is the first time either of them seem to contemplate life beyond Dany, to the point where they plan what to do on their own after she has the throne. Is this significant at all?GHOST! WE HAVE GHOST!(Please God don\u2019t kill Ghost. NO. I hear that CGI showing a direwolf dying is really expensive. Think of your costs!)Sam asks Jon if he\u2019s told Dany yet. Jon has not. Edd shows up. It\u2019s a nice throwback to the Wall, with Jon, Edd, Sam and the wolf. Jon says Sam should go to the crypts. With the shots so tightly focused, they could be at the Wall.Jaime and Tyrion are sitting in front of the fire. Guess Bran didn\u2019t tell Tyrion anything, ahem, interesting? Here\u2019s where that promo still of Jaime smiling is from. Brienne tells Pod not to drink. Half a cup only (sure).I like this already. And Davos! And Tormund. What does Jaime think about Tormund hitting on Brienne. \u201cBrought my own.\u201d Oh my GOD. Tormund has zeroed in on Jaime as his competition for Brienne. Tormund then proceeds to down his whole horn of wine. This is fantastic. More. MORE.Sandor\u2019s drinking alone. Does he not know it\u2019s more fun in by the fire? Arya sits down to join him. Arya asks him what he\u2019s doing up here. \u201cI fought for you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Here\u2019s Beric. He\u2019s fine with having been on Arya\u2019s list. Sandor threatens to chuck Beric over the castle wall before tossing him the winesack. Arya leaves, declaring them \u201cmiserable old shits.\u201dGendry watches Arya do target practice. He has her new toy! She likes it. Gendry tells Arya what Melisandre did to him and reveals that he\u2019s Robert\u2019s bastard. Arya asks Gendry about his sex life. Oh. OH GOD. Is Arya old enough for this? I was not expecting this. It\u2019s \u2026 kind of hot? They better hope Jon doesn\u2019t walk in. It feels sort of wrong because Arya is supposed to be this \u2026 uh, child? But she\u2019s not anymore. You know what? YOU GET YOURS, ARYA. GET IT.I would love to know if the showrunners came up with Arya and Gendry having sex on their own or if Maisie Williams was like, \u201cHey can we do this?\u201d EDIT: Apparently Maisie thought it was prank? Oh dear.Tormund Giantsbane, progressive gender egalitarian!Jaime knights Brienne. They\u2019re all gonna die soon. Why the fuck not?! This is a great scene. It\u2019s poignant and weighty and honestly unexpected. \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d Rolllll credits.Brienne\u2019s teared up and everyone claps for her. This is fantastic. Ser Brienne of Tarth. Fuck yeah.Jorah is trying to talk some sense into his cousin. Lyanna\u2019s in armor and spoiling for a fight. Sam gives Jorah Heartsbane, in Jeor\u2019s honor. I like that Sam frames the gift as being about what Jeor taught him and not as a guilt trip about what happened to his family.Dear God the hall crowd is out of wine. What song are we getting? Jenny of Oldstones! As he sings we see Sam and Gilly, Sansa and Theon, Gendry and Arya, Grey Worm and Missandei, and Jorah.Dany comes down to the Winterfell crypts and finds Jon. Whose statue is Jon standing in front of? It looks like Lyanna\u2019s? Yes, Lyanna\u2019s. \u201cWho\u2019s that.\u201d Who indeed.Dany can\u2019t square who she\u2019s been told Rhaegar was with someone who raped Lyanna. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201dJon tells Dany who he really is. He seems to have added some new details? The whole \u201cbled to death on her birthing bed\u201d thing \u2026 has Sam been talking to Jon about this more off-screen? Has Jon been talking to Bran?\u201cCongrats, Dany, you fucked your nephew.\u201dDany asks who told Jon this. Jon says it was Bran and Sam confirmed it. Dany is skeptical that Jon\u2019s brother and his best friend are the ones who told him this.Dany drops the hammer. Jon\u2019s the last male heir to the family. He has a claim to the throne. Aaaaaaand it\u2019s dropped as the horn blows. It\u2019s showtime. NOTE: The very first thing Dany says when this comes out is that Jon\u2019s the last male heir of the house and has a claim to the Iron Throne. Her first instinct isn\u2019t to embrace him as family (even in the way Targaryens, uh, tend to treat their family) or express joy that her brother wasn\u2019t a rapist or seem like she\u2019s happy not to be alone anymore. Her immediate instinct is to label him as a dynastic threat. Hmm.Jon nods at Dany, she nods back and they head off. Guessing to go get the dragons.Here\u2019s the Night King and Co. now. EDIT: Took a rewatch but I notice the Night King isn\u2019t actually with this group of Others. Guessing he\u2019s coming in on the dragon? Eesh.Final thoughts: I really liked this episode. A lovely mix of throwbacks, new stuff and a few things (Arya and Gendry actually having sex, Brienne being knighted) that were pleasantly unexpected. Jaime\u2019s \u201ctrial\u201d was a bit of a letdown even if it broadly went the way I thought it would. Everything else though \u2014 the interactions, the voiceovers, how Winterfell is just heaving with activity, it was all done really well. I think it was inspired to leave both Sansa and Dany and Jon and Dany on a bit of a clifhanger until the fight unfolds. It ensures that there will still be a powder keg waiting to go off when it\u2019s done. Dany didn\u2019t come off as poorly as she did in the first episode \u2014 her anger and skepticism were pretty reasonable \u2014 but she still looks off balance. She went to Sansa (I guess Jorah told her to try harder to make inroads?) and it backfired, with Sansa not biting any of what Dany was offering. And Jon did what he probably thought was the right thing by telling her who he was; he may come to regret it though.", "The episode begins promisingly enough, jumping straight to the \u2018trial\u2019 of Jaime Lannister \u2014 no foreplay. Sadly, apart from Sansa and Dany exchanging side-eyes and Arya cashing in her V-Card (also no foreplay), this is as interesting as the episode gets. And even Jaime\u2019s little trial lacks tension, since we all know in our hearts he isn\u2019t going to die in the hall at Winterfell. Who is he, Littlefinger?While the premiere did a serviceable job setting the table, \u2018A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u2019 wastes time shamelessly trying to exploit our nostalgia for earlier seasons without advancing the story in any meaningful way \u2014 until its final clickbaity moments.I get it: a bunch of these characters are about to die, and this is the show\u2019s last chance to remind us how much we care about them. But it seems the only way the writers know how to accomplish this is to have the citizens of Westeros get drunk, tell stories we\u2019ve already heard, and congratulate each other on their character arcs.\u201cWow, can you believe how far we\u2019ve come?\u201dYes, actually, I can. I\u2019ve been here the whole time. Is this about to turn into an \u201980s sitcom clip show? Did you guys blow that much money on fucking CGI?In a scene on the battlements, Tyrion repeats his old line about how he hopes to die: \u201cIn my own bed, at the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and \u2014\u201d \u201cA girl\u2019s mouth around your cock.\u201d Jaime finishes the quip for him, and it\u2019s hard not to interpret this as the show subconsciously expressing boredom with itself.A few thoughts:Speaking of Tyrion, one of the reasons I\u2019ve soured so much on this show is the utter neglect of his character. Last season, GoT turned Tyrion into a total idiot for the sake of the plot; in this episode, we\u2019re treated to Ser Jorah reminding Dany just how smart the imp truly is, as though one boring conversation is supposed to make everyone forget the past. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re setting up some kind of redemption for Tyrion, but it had really better be good. He\u2019s been a shadow of his former self ever since he got sucked into Dany\u2019s orbit.Meanwhile Sansa has only grown smarter and bolder. It\u2019s just so frustrating that, by necessity, she must take a backseat to Jon and Dany, even though she\u2019s a far more interesting and well-developed character. Dany doesn\u2019t deserve the throne; Jon neither deserves nor desires it. But Sansa? She actually is what Tyrion once thought he was.Arya\u2019s sex scene with Gendry is an example of how to demonstrate that characters have changed without simply having them make declarative statements about it. These two don\u2019t squander their (potential) last night on earth talking about how much fun they used to have with Hot Pie back in the day. Instead, Arya\u2019s hilariously blunt proposition reminds us of the awkward pre-teen crush she had on Gendry and we are induced to reflect on how different she is now. Also, quite honestly, good for her.It is maddening that last season felt so rushed, but now we seem to have an hour to blow on nothing in particular. And for all this wasted time, we couldn\u2019t even get a few minutes of Varys trying to buck Tyrion up? Those are the kind of moments I\u2019m genuinely nostalgic for!Ser Jorah trying to convince Lyanna Mormont to wait out the battle in the crypts is a nice touch. I\u2019ve grown tired of scenes whose only premise is \u201cwow, these two characters are finally meeting each other!\u201d \u2026but this one gets a pass if only because it was such a delightful little surprise. Plus Lyanna Mormont is that rarest thing: an adorable badass.Overall grade: C-", "A return to form.I wrote here about how disappointed I was in the lack of gratification all the reunions had. Winterfell nixed almost all drama the show had been building eight seasons up to. But seeing A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms it becomes more clear why. The first episode really was just a grocery list to be checked off, and the in-depth reunions came in the second episode. I don\u2019t essentially agree with that decision - for one, a Hound/Arya convo in E02 felt devalued by their hurried encounter in E01 - but I am glad the writers understood upfront that these reunions needed time to breathe and have legitimate consequences. Also where the whole Beyond the Wall business relied on characters presuming something the audience very well knew was never going to happen, this episode harkened back to the old Game of Thrones. These weren\u2019t characters acting foolishly even though the audience knows better, these were characters having learned and changed despite sometimes the audience knowing better.I didn\u2019t quite grasp this nuance until now. Jon looks foolish for discrediting Sansa in front of Arya not because we saw the union between the sisters and he didn\u2019t. But because Sansa has warned Jon a thousand times that she knew better and he still hasn\u2019t grown into trusting her. Mirror this with a Jorah who discredits Lyanna and we can forgive him. Just like Jon (and Tyrion regarding Cersei) he remarks something, we the audience, know very well is never going to happen. But unlike them, this is Jorah\u2019s first time. So we forgive him his foolishness and enjoy Lyanna scolding him the way she does everyone. That\u2019s a subtle difference between much of Season 7 and the S8 premiere and all their rightfully critiqued plot points of characters doing predictably foolish sh*t and never learning and this episode.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms delivered on the premise of change and growth and we got some huge emotions because of it. If you had told me three years ago that a Th\u00e9on/Sansa reunion would do more to me than Jon/Arya I would have punched you in the face. But it did, largely because of Turner and Allen get to play more with emotions than Harington and Williams in their more reserved characters, but also because Jon and Arya fell into their old rhythms of big brother and little sister, whereas Tyrion and Sansa have grown so much since we first met them. The tension that came from Daenerys feeling left out by the intimacy on display was a nice cherry on top. This is why we watch eight seasons. So we can see conflict build while understanding everyone\u2019s motives because we\u2019ve seen their journey. And it resulted in great moments all through out the episode:Bran staying silent on Jaime\u2019s heinous actSansa knowing about Jaime\u2019s attack on NedSansa playing DaenerysGhost!Davos, Gilly and the little girlMissandei referring back to NaathBran finally spilling some beans on the Night KingTh\u00e9on defending BranBrothers of the Night\u2019s Watch reflecting on their journeyTyrion\u2019s drinking partyArya realising the Hound fought for herSam giving his family sword to JorahArya taking charge of her sexualityPodrick singing and throwing Brienne a look when she says she doesn\u2019t want to be a knightDaenerys reaction to Jon\u2019s secretAll of these were emotional character beats that weren\u2019t built on how stubborn or short-sighted they are, but on how much these characters had grown into themselves. With that, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms rewarded long time fans with moments that meant the world to us because of the characters. And the best, most beautiful one was definitely: a freshly knighted Brienne smiling.I literally want to look at that smile forever. This pure, unadulterated happiness from someone who actually, genuinely deserves it. Jaime casually mentions the oath of bravery, just and defend the innocents, but they\u2019re huge themes in the entire saga. And for Brienne as a character to not only get that recognition in the story but for us as well as to realise how rare it is she personifies these noble causes, was truly a series highlight. If only this show wasn\u2019t known for killing characters off\u2026", "A late collection of thematic analyses, short takes, and Reddit jokes.Two warnings:Lots of commentary gets into future spoiler territory. Like, I could be wrong about lots/all of it, and I\u2019m not relying on set leaks or anything \u2014 but the closer we look at the clues, the fewer surprises ahead.I\u2019m going to focus on political philosophy, meta-narratives, and the hidden meaning of Jenny\u2019s Song. Some will find this fascinating, but lots will also find it all a bit a dull. Buyer beware.Anyway, let\u2019s start from 10,000 feet up.#1: Competing EndgamesIf I had to pick a list of source materials that seem to have inspired Martin\u2019s writings, one particular essay would top the list: The Moral Equivalent of War by philosopher-psychologist William James.Its basic thesis is that war is useful for mankind, in that it providesa crucible/outlet for the \u201cmartial virtues\u201dan engine of focused innovationa cause around which culture can unify\u2026while also being hideously ugly and forever opposed to all the values that humans point to as uniquely and positively human \u2014 which leaves us with a rather stubborn problem: how to replicate all the good that comes with war without all the spilt treasure \u2014 i.e., how to come up with a moral equivalent.James had his own set of ideas (basically mandatory service in a Chore Corps), but most subsequent pacifists have been more interested in James\u2019 framing than his solution, each having their own spin on the latter.Martin is one of those pacifists. The famous Broken Man speech from A Feast for Crows reads like something of a thesis for the entire saga. War is a sick game, and it\u2019s the man and woman in the village just trying to raise a family and tend to a cow or two that are paying the price for a victory which is always more a matter of ego than anything likely to be useful to 99% of the war\u2019s ultimate funders.Now, sure, the extinction event of a Long Night is a bit different. Maybe the farmer does have cause to beat his plowshare into a sword for that. But even there, Martin is clever: the walkers mean death to all, yes \u2014 but less in the sense of amoral disaster and more in the sense of reckoning for the sins of the 1%.The First Men, possessed by their expansionary ambitions, ran roughshod over Westeros\u2019 natives, leading the latter to unleash a force which quickly outgrew their control. Just so, a family obsessed with dragons as a means of perpetuating power (who were also the sole survivors of the culture which created dragons as a means of establishing power) escalated the game of thrones, which is now culminating in the person of Cersei Lannister \u2014 i.e., someone obsessed with ruling the realms of men, somewhat regardless of whether any men or women survive to inhabit it.Ice and fire are thus the embodiment of our unbridled ambitions and thoughtlessness concerning collateral costs \u2014 of our stunning brutishness and lack of creativity in coming up with better ways to associate and govern.But here\u2019s the tricky thing: do the showrunners see this grand narrative the same way?Martin\u2019s endgame is bound to be structural and institutional and a little wonky: the game must give way to something like constitutional monarchy, and those who survive must develop some moral equivalent to war. But the showrunners \u2014 do they share in Martin\u2019s philosophical depth?I guess what I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m prepared to be disappointed by a comparatively thin and unsatisfying ending. While I still hope to be surprised in a good way, these last few seasons, while immensely fulfilling in terms of dialogue and spectacle, just haven\u2019t felt as substantial.#2: A Story of Two SongsSo, Pod had his Pippen moment on Sunday. And it was handled beautifully \u2014 a lovely voice singing over a montage of those about to be sacrificed to the endgame gods, made more powerful by Ramin\u2019s genius scoring.But why the specific song they chose?The first two lines appear in the books, part of an ode known eponymously as Jenny\u2019s Song (one of two songs referred to in the books without a standard title). It was presumably written by Rhaegar during one of his artist residencies in the ruins of Summerhall \u2014 and its theme is important.If Rhaegar\u2019s \u201csong of ice and fire\u201d (the other song referenced above) is our macro guide to the saga, Jenny\u2019s Song is about human choices in a highly personal sense. It tells us what people do for love in a world bent on punishing acts of will that run contrary to the game.A bit of background:The Jenny in question was the commoner wife of Duncan Targaryen. In marrying her, Duncan gave up his dynastic rights (he had been betrothed to a Baratheon woman he didn\u2019t love as a favor to Lyonel Baratheon, who had supported the coronation of Duncan\u2019s father).This led to the first (short) Baratheon rebellion, which ended with a consolation prize of Duncan\u2019s sister Rhaelle being offered to the brother of the woman Duncan spurned. (This union led to the birth of Robert Baratheon, who would lead a more successful rebellion later.)Duncan\u2019s decision incensed his father, Aegon V, who ultimately settled on his other son Jaehaerys II as successor. But, surprise, Jaehaerys took his brother\u2019s action as impetus for his own breakup \u2014 choosing his sister Shaera. (They had been betrothed to a Tully and Tyrell respectively, as part of Aegon\u2019s scheme to favor political alliances over a pure Targaryen bloodline.)To make it a trifecta, Aegon\u2019s other son, Daeron, also bucked his own betroval (to Lady Olenna) in favor of a life of banging a fellow knight. (Though it\u2019s possible that Olenna pushed pretty hard for this breakup, as she apparently found the Targaryen family a little weird.)Aegon hated all this, but felt compelled to let it stand. He\u2019d been allowed to marry for love himself, being low on the list of succession at the time, which perhaps softened him. And so Jaehaerys II became the crowned prince.Jenny later invited a woods witch to Summerhall, who gave the prophecy about \u201cthe prince who was promised\u201d, which led Jaehaerys to marry his two children Aerys II and Rhaella (against Aegon\u2019s wishes) to ensure said prince came from his bloodline. (Rhaella had wanted to marry a knight from the stormlands, but was overruled by her father.)Rhaella\u2019s first child with Aerys (presumably) was Rhaegar, who was born the same night as the Tragedy at Summerhall.This tragedy is thematically important in a macro sense. While much is still unknown (on purpose), the gist is that Aegon, in his quest to bring back dragons, did something with pyromancers and wildfire that burned the hall down, leading to his own death, along with Duncan\u2019s (thus widowing Jenny and ushering in the reign of Jaehaerys).(As an aside, there\u2019s a rumor that Aerys and Joanna Lannister got together on the night of Jaehaerys\u2019 coronation, and that this affair continued after Joanna married Tywin, possibly leading to Tyrion\u2019s conception. This probably matters more to the books, but Tyrion being a Targaryen is still on the table.)Taking this together, Duncan\u2019s decision to marry Jenny for love was one of the major precipitating events of the current saga, as it led to a bunch of alliance-fracturing, the rise of House Baratheon, the rule of the Mad King, and pretty much everything else that\u2019s happened in the show.So, the song itself. It centers on an image of Jenny dancing with the ghosts of Summerhall in the manner of that scene from Haunting of Hill House \u2014 i.e., in a state of communion with a simple and imaginary world of love and warmth, in contrast with the very ugly and very real world defined by the great game.The theory is that Rhaegar crossed paths with that woods witch (now known as the Ghost of High Hall), who told him Jenny\u2019s story. He then, in one of his trips to the ruins of Summerhall, wrote her song as a reflection of his own situation, envisioning a world in which he and his true love could enjoy that which Duncan and Jenny were denied, where summers and winters would pass and walls would crumble and all could pay that no heed as they danced on with their lovers. As such, it reflects his desire to abdicate and quit the game, while also acknowledging that quitting comes with consequences.This theme is everywhere in the saga. Rhaegar ultimately chose for love, thus spurning the Martells and causing the deaths of Brandon and Rickard Stark. Rickard\u2019s daughter Lyanna also chose for love, crushing Robert, who married Cersei, who preferred her brother and ultimately killed Robert. Even Ned, who loved Ashara, married Catelyn because of Brandon\u2019s death, thus giving birth to the son who would break a betrothal to a Frey, leading to the Red Wedding. Had everyone married for love in a healthy political system, much could have been avoided. But the ambition which gave birth to the ice (walkers) and fire (dragons) would allow no such thing, leading to the birth of ice and fire united (Jon Snow / Aegon VI), who is now tasked with breaking the wheel.But Jonno has Dany in his way on one side, and Cersei on the other \u2014 and the Night King to boot. All have their own motivations, none of which are really rooted in creating a world where Rhaegar or Jenny would be free to love, or where dragons and walkers wouldn\u2019t be thought necessary.#3: Quick TakesThough I touched on this last week, I feel compelled to again point out that everyone in Winterfell has a collective IQ of 7. Bran is the most underutilized resource since the invention of birth control. Why is Tyrion the only one asking him questions, AND WHY DID TYRION GIVE UP AFTER EIGHT MINUTES TO DRINK INSTEAD?Everyone in Winterfell also has the emotional IQ of like -32 (excepting Gilly, and maybe Arya). These people would struggle to get jobs in customer service at Popeye's Chicken. I suppose it makes for good drama, but Jonno\u2019s and Sansa\u2019s approach to Dany were F- in terms of thoughtfulness or efficacy or any other plausibly positive quality. Jonno didn\u2019t bother to qualify when he\u2019d come upon this new information, and Sansa was needlessly antagonistic, etc. This isn\u2019t good writing. You could bring up all the same tensions without any of these shortcuts.Also, while I get that the purpose of the episode was to give a few arcs a happy tinge before the brutality of next week, people really displayed some curious priorities. Preparing to die without words left unsaid is good, but is also a distinct second to, you know, planning to avoid dying.The Hound got in his cheeky line, but maybe this is exactly the time to be asking deeper questions about Beric\u2019s experiences and his theories on what the Lord of Light wants \u2014 because bringing people back from the dead (as non-wights) is a pretty relevant concern right now.About The Hound \u2014 his other line about \u201cmight as well be at a bloody wedding\u201d. Is that a nod that we\u2019re going to see Robb and Catelyn Stark come out of the crypts next week? I think it might be.Speaking of the Red Wizards, when is Melisandre coming back, and is it going to be in context of a Gandalf moment? Also, will she ultimately sacrifice herself for the team to make up for Shireen? Hope we get good resolution there, whatever the form. Her thread with Varys was too intriguing to be left untied.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is unreasonably handsome, unreasonably good at acting, and landed an all-time part. Good for him. The casting directors really nailed it on so many choices.Um, I thought this season was supposed to have less teleporting? How did Theon get to Winterfell in two seconds when his sister was going west around the island?Great choice in directors this season. Alan Taylor (of Mother\u2019s Mercy fame) was brought in for episodes 1, 2, and 4 \u2014 which seem to be all the intimate reunions and emotional sendoffs (and likely burials). His little touches (like Jaime\u2019s hand when knighting Brienne, and the focus on Dany\u2019s face when Jonno broke the news) have been great.Similarly, bringing Miguel back for episodes 3 and 5 is super compelling. He\u2019s already done some of the best battle scenes ever committed to film, and he\u2019s got two more kicks at the can with even higher stakes and budgets.That said, allowing the showrunners to direct the denouement itself? I get why they\u2019d want to \u2014 but are they really the best choice? (I don\u2019t know the answer to that question, but I\u2019m interested in how that conversation went, and who got in their say, and how it was resolved.)#4: Reddit Round-up(As fair warning, Reddit humor is largely dark and twisted. Not for everyone, nor should it probably be for everyone.)(Jokes aside, she is 100% going to fight a resurrected Stark.)(I\u2019m sorry, but also not sorry.)(This user was like the 873th person to point this out, but I think the writers deserve credit for the long game here.)(This reminds me of Jim and Pam. Karen was great, and we watched Jim do wrong by her because he wanted Pam more, and we watched Pam accept Jim even though he was a prolific boundary-crosser and general slacker. While Jaime has had a great arc, we can see from his recent scenes with Tyrion and Edmure that he\u2019s still all kinds of messed up. Brienne can do better, and Tormund is an all-around catch. But, yes, sure, fine, I\u2019ll be cheering for Jaime-Brienne anyway.)(Also the only lad with the stones to tell Jonno the bad news, and to defy his father. Sam has really been the Most Improved Player of the show.)(While the dialogue in this last episode was pretty good in the context of emotional resolution and fan-service, they really did foreshadow this one a bit too heavily.)", "Before I start this long review, let's celebrate the 5 seconds of Ghost in the corner of the frame - GHOST!!! GHOST!!! GHOST!!!The last episode was super-paced and this one was super slow. While the last one was the episode of reunions, this one was of extended reunions.Some expected events in the episode:Brienne spoke in favor of JamieSansa accepted Jamie and that was the look (Dany stared at Sansa) shown in the promoDany was really pissed at Tyrion. In the first scene, when he started to speak, it looked like she was going to beat him upArya asked for a staff-spear, self-pat on the back (Abhinav Sisodia's answer to What does Arya want Gendry to make with the Valerian steel and why?)Lyanna and Jorah fight. Lady Lyanna is not gonna sit out the battleSam gives Heartsbane to Jorah as his father taught Sam how to do the right thingDany was shocked as she heard the truth of Jon's parentageShe also deduced it in seconds what it would mean - Jon would have a better claim on the throne. And this is where the show creates drama, Jon could have easily told her that he doesn't care about the throne, but that line is never spoken and episode ends with the arrival of NKSome un-expected events in the episode:Bran didn't spoke out for Jamie; the wildfire plot remains hidden and truth of Jaime killing Aerys would never be knownBrienne was knighted by Jamie, that was emotionalPod is a good singer and his rendition of \"Jenny of oldstones\" was a nice touch along with the montageArya and Gendry had sex. Never would have anticipated thatDany and Sansa scene was my favorite. They both shared some laughs and were to the point. Dany started it nicely with smiles and compliments and Sansa assured her that Jon loves her. Dany laid out what she felt and what she wants from Sansa and Sansa ended with what she wants from Dany. At least, it's all out in the open. No more speculations. Detailed answer here - Abhinav Sisodia's answer to What did you think of the Daenerys/Sansa reconciliation scene?Question remains now is that would Dany agree to what Sansa wants or we would have a civil war after the battle with DeadAnd \"oh snap\" moment, the line was \"He (Tyrion) should have never trusted Cersei; You never should have either\", so Sansa clapped back in Tyrion's defense, not on her own. That hurtComing to the character-wise review:Dany - This episode was hard on her.Jon avoided her during the entire episode and then dropped the R+L=J bomb on her in the endHer hand has fucked up for the umpteenth timeTried to make friends with Sansa and was told her that they could be a happy family only if Dany gives up her claim on the NorthEveryone who arrives at Winterfell seems to gravitate towards Sansa (Jaime and Theon)Sansa -She accepted Jaime on Brienne's word. That was mature of herHer scene with Dany was nicely doneTheon and her scenes were quite tender and makes you wonder if the show is building up to something hereArya -She continued with her flirting with Gendry and took it to conclusion by the endHer \"I know death\" scene was even more badass than I thought, and she knows how to flirt around Gendry (my weapon? Yes mam, right on it). The way their dynamics work is cute, she knows how to push his buttonsHad a mini-reunion with Hound and Beric as wellJon - Not much to do in the episode except brood and reminisce about good old times with his NW brothers - Sam and EddHis reveal to Dany was expected but his surprise at Dany's deduction (that he has a better claim) was a bit strange. Sam has spelled it out for him in the last episode, so was he surprised that Dany figured it out so quickly, or he just loves to be surprised?Random points\"How do you know there is an afterwards? \" - curtains for poor Jamie?Tyrion looked really unsure of himself and it was sad to see him so down. \"Tyrion is working with Cersei\" theory can die nowDragonglass spikes on walls was a good touchLot of sweet Jamie-Brienne momentShe vouched for himJamie sought her out on the grounds to offer his services under her commandJamie knighted BrienneThe girl with burned cheek - reminded Davos of ShireenImpressive war council - almost every key player and some minor ones as well (hello Lady Karstark) were presentNK is coming for Bran and he would be alone in the godswood as a bait. Maybe that's where Jon rushes with his men as shown in the season 8 trailerWhat would be the bittersweet ending for Grey Worm and Missandei? Would they survive and live our their days in Naath or one of them would die in the battle?Jamie-Brienne-Tyrion-Pod having a drink while Davos warms his balls - never thought I would write this senetenceThings got really awkward after Tormund gets into the details of his name and source of his strengthArya's realization that she can shoot arrows or better, have sex, than sit with two miserable old shits", "S08E02: This episode could have been shot in 20 min. Rest all was unnecessary.Key points in the episodes were:Jaime\u2019s Trial - The whole scene was well shot. The way Brienne stands between Jaime & the jury depicts that she was ready to protect Jaime with her life the same way Jaime stood between her & the bear. The only thing that was out of track is Sansa\u2019s strong trust towards Brienne.War Council - A lot of information could have been spilled by Jon to better fight the White Walkers. He only said that Night King\u2019s demise will result in their victory. He could have told the hierarchy of walkers. Night King -||- White Walkers(Craster\u2019s Baby) -||- Wights. Focusing on killing white walers should also be one of the major points in the meeting as it would result in the fall of the wights created by those walkers. It was interesting that there had a private talk between Bran & Tyrion as this could be pivotal in the coming episode. I\u2019m sure that Bran is going to die next episode & the info that he shared with Tyrion will change the course of the battle.Jenny of the Oldstone song - Well, this was unexpected in a good way. They have filled the rest of the lyrics of the original 2 lines of the song written by GRRM. Jenny the Oldstone was supposed to be written by Rheghar himself about the tragedy of Summerhall. Who died in the tragedy apart from Aegon the Vth & his firstborn Duncan Targaryen? - Duncan the Tall, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard - who is supposed to be the predecessor of Brienne. And guess what, who was born on that day in Summerhall, Jon\u2019s dad Rheghar Targaryen. The song was well placed between the scenes of Brienne being Knighted & Jon revealing his parentage.Jon revealing his parentage to Dany", "This episode felt like an old BioWare RPG right before the last boss fight: lots of leveled-up characters with complicated histories having slightly-stilted conversations with zingy one-liners. I loved it.A few notes:Dany\u2019s theatrics with Jaime show how much she sees this as the Dany Show, and it\u2019s all about her connection to/claim on the Iron Throne. It was a nice moment for Brienne to stand up for someone that deserved it and a stupid way for Dany to waste time and political capital. Wish Brienne had whipped out Oathkeeper, but I guess it\u2019d be awkward explaining where that Valyrian steel came from.Like a lot of the characters in this episode it\u2019s interesting that Ice is, technically, back in Winterfell if not in one piece: Jaime has Widow\u2019s Wail and Brienne has Oathkeeper.Glad to see the show remembers that Ghost exists right before Ghost will eat up the last of the wolfy CGI budget and die a heroic death.I don\u2019t really get the building up of Tyrion by Jorah and Dany. It rings especially hollow after Tyrion assures Jaime that \u201cthis one is different\u201d. Like really Tyrion how many times are you going to be wrong. It makes me think that the show has something big left for Tyrion to do but I just can\u2019t see how or more importantly why.Dany\u2019s talk with Sansa went about as expected and I just loved Sansa\u2019s no-bs approach to \u201cwhat about the North\u201d.Where TF is Howland Reed? If there was ever a time I expected to see him, it\u2019d be now. Maybe he\u2019ll show up when it\u2019s time to vouch for Jon\u2019s claim but honestly I expected him to be here sooner given that the Starks called their banners.I appreciated the emphasis on the brother of Gregor talking to the guy who was killed by Gregor next to the assassin who wants to kill Gregor\u2026 almost makes me think we\u2019re going to see Gregor get in a fight with someone again.Bran is wooden and boring and perhaps too close to deus ex omniscience for anyone to have an interesting conversation with him. I wish I could get excited thinking about the conversation he had with Tyrion.Tormund Giantsbane stole the show of course because he\u2019s the best character.I enjoyed Arya\u2019s scenes with Gendry but I still don\u2019t quite get why Gendry of all people arrives back at Winterfell but isn\u2019t making Valyrian steel, given the auspiciousness of his apprenticeship.Loved seeing Tyrion pour his old squire an overflowing cup of wine.I\u2019d bet Jaime\u2019s a POV character if this part of the story ever hits print.I tried counting the White Walkers\u0014 \u0014 in that shot and got to 10, and I can\u2019t remember how many (from 13) there are supposed to be now. Seems very intentional though and I wish I understood what the 13 significance was.The last shot was a nice callback to Tyrion pissing over The Wall in S1. I wonder how literal it was.Things I am skeptical about:Bran\u2019s plan to lure in the Night King. What could go wrong there, eh?!The crypt being the safest place\u2026 after it was explicitly said on the show it was the safest place like 10 times.The dragons being useful.Who makes it through the Battle for Winterfell?Protected By Unfinished Business: The Hound, Jaime, Sansa, Varys, Jon, Dany, Drogon & Tyrion (per the show building him up at least)Not Safe But Has A Lot Of Interesting Stuff They Could Do: Arya, Rhaegal, Bran, Tormund (only because I can\u2019t bear to put him in the next category) & SamPoised to die heroically: Theon, Jorah, Ghost, Lyanna, Grey Worm, Girl With A Burnt Face, Beric, Rhaegal, Brienne, Dolorous Edd, Gendry, Davos, PodrickWild prediction: Dany panics and takes off on Drogon to marry Euron.", "*Spoiler alert*Ok, where do I even start ?First of all, this is the episode we deserve, after one mediocre season and a little decent opening episode of the final episode.It was filled with emotions,stuff we wanted to see but not in a rushed way it have been for a while.Danerys becoming more and more Aerys is what we can see here. The way she treated Jaime was a little understandable, but the scenes with Sansa when she asked about the North and when Jon revealed his identity is perfectly showing how bad she wants the iron throne and that alone.Arya and Gendry getting some action. It was written in a way it can be rushed still we all are satisfied(including those two lol). Whenever I saw this two I always thought of the words late Robert baratheon, \u201cI have a son, you have a daughter, we'll join our houses\u201d , and this gave that words a little hope.Arya getting her weapon. Even though we don't know what kinda if weapon or how she gonna use it I was thrilled to bits when she asked for it on the first episode now I can't even contain the excitement now she has it. Also this makes me wonder whether she'll survive the night king or not. Her curbe has been on the growing since episode one I'm afraid for her life.The brothers United. Ever since Jon left for winterfell after resurrected , I was always looking forwad to the scene of him and Edd reuniting. I got that in this episode but it was even topped with the scene where Jon,Sam and Edd talking about the watch days. It was nostalgic coz it was the same thing they were fighting back then but just as brothers but now with different powers and titles.Lady Sansa, oh my word. Anyone who just sees her as little bird who made mistakes backs then are all who are seeing the show for the Dragons. The character development she had and still having is amazing. She's showing us who she's. She's a Stark. Her loyalty is towards the north and she's not gonna compromise anything. The way she says \u201cWe should let him stay\u201d, The way she ignores Danerys in asking her to let Theon stay or Hugging and telling us she's not Cersei, she just learned things from her and she gets better and better everyday.I can write and write but I'll end up explaining every single second of this episode , so I'mma just compile little things I saw in a single point before I put down the main ones.Tormund hugging Jon surprisingly, hitting on the Big woman , Brienne getting Knighted that too in the hands of Jaime, moments between Missandei and Grey Worm, Sam and Gilly, Jorah's advices to Danerys, Little moment between Arya, The Hound and Lord Beric was hilarious yet we needed it. We caught a glimpse of Ghost, finally. Ser Daavos seeing princess Shireen on that little girl was too powerful and it shows how much Ser Daavos loved the princess.Now I'll list the few major things I saw in this episode.Ser Jorah getting Heartsbane. You might wonder why I didn't list this in the small things. But Jorah has always been a contender on the list of Azor Ahai Candidates and he getting a Valyrian steel which may become light bringer is making him as a strong candidate according to me.Night King's motive. From the very beginning we always wondered what the Night King wants. In this episode when Bran says he wants an \u201cAn endless night\u201d, it makes us clear he wants all of the humans gone but we don't know whether he just wants that alone. Also I was wondering when the mark on Bran's hand was gonna be mentioned while it was done here.I might be over thinking this one but this episode where Sansa wanted the North to themselves make me wonder about Cersei's prophecy. \u201cYou'll be queen, for a time. Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.\" All of other Cersei's prophecies came true except this one. You may think Margery did it but she definitely didn't seeing the way Margery is dead and cersei is on the iron throne. Danerys is a queen and she may do it,yes but the rivalry between these two and Sansa's growth makes me think.Saved the best for the last. Jaime's redemption arc. The writers may spoiled many things over the years but they never failed on this one. Jaime is redeeming himself more and more as days go by and he's getting mature. Can't stop myself from telling this, Nikolaj is making Jaime more and more lovable. The way he apologized to Bran, the way he Knighted Brienne, the way he acknowledged that he was not as good as fighter before, that he wanted to fight under the command of Brienne, I'll put my money on Jaime more than Danerys on surviving the Night kingAnd finally we can change the Winter is coming to the present tense Winter has come since the walkers are here on winterfell.Cheers", "It was brilliant from start to finish.This episode solidified my opinion that the show, since surpassing the book material it is based upon, may have some flaws with pacing and plotting, but one thing it does not suffer from is character. This show and these writers know their characters, and this episode does them great justice from top to bottom.This episode had virtually no plot development. The Night King and his army hangs like the Sword of Damocles over Winterfell, and the blow has not yet landed. Jaime had a brief inquisition which ended with him being allowed to fight alongside the living. As expected. Tormund, Edd, and Beric arrived from the Wall and informed Jon and company that time is short. As expected.This episode truly shined in the interactions between characters, which were all given appropriate time to breathe and were well framed by the impending doom hanging over everyone. No one held back, because there is no reason to. This resulted in several incredible character moments that, without that impending doom, might never have come to fruition.There's almost too many to go through, but I'll try:Jaime's Inquisition: This went about as expected, with Dany understandably angered by Jaime's very presence and disappointed by his news of Cersei's betrayal. Tyrion and Brienne spoke up for Jaime, with Brienne's vouch for him solidifying Sansa's position and Jon's realistic need for every fighting man he can get sealing the deal. It had to end that way. For Dany to have Jaime imprisoned and/or executed at this point would be catastrophic for her as a ruler of any kind.The Night's Watch Reunion: It was great to see Jon, Sam, and Edd together one more time. Particularly the banter between Sam and Edd. Sam has come so very far from when we first met him at Castle Black in Season 1. He has a family and deeds worthy of song, and Edd is begrudgingly forced to accept that Samwell Tarly is a verified badass.Also, GHOST SIGHTING!Sansa v. Dany, Part 1 of ???: This was a good scene. It wasn't as sterling as some of the others, but it hit all the right beats. First and foremost, it showed Dany trying to use something other than fear and intimidation to bring people to her side. She showed Sansa genuine warmth, and made a great point about how her love for Jon had brought her to Winterfell, not her quest for the Iron Throne. Sansa, in her own way, gave as much ground as she was willing to cede, but held firm on the independence of the North. And for good reason. She's suffered a great deal to be in the position she is, and she has become a great leader in her own right. If she is going to pledge the North to Daenerys, she will need to see action from Dany, not just words. Action which will no doubt happen next week.The War Council: The only thing that surprised me here was that there was no discussion of an evacuation, should things go badly (which they are basically sure to do). Otherwise, yeah, taking out the Night King is really your only play. Theon is definitely being set up for a heroic death in defense of Bran, which is the best way for him to go, really. He's redeemed himself with just about everyone except Bran, at this point.Arya + Hound + Beric: I don't think I will ever not love these two together. \"When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?\" \"I fought for you, didn't I?\"Arya + Gendry: Genuinely surprised that they moved this fast with this relationship, but then again, there is that impending doom underlying everyone's motives in this episode. Although it was mildly shocking to see Arya in a sexual situation, since we met her at the tender age of 8, this was an important moment for her. This is the first time in ages that she has let go of the single-minded focus on survival and/or vengeance and given in to her basic humanity. It bodes well for her surviving the whole thing. Gendry, not so much...Lyanna + Jorah Mormont: I was happy to see them address these two characters. It went about as I expected a scene between them would. I doubt little Lyanna \"Sassy Bear\" Mormont is coming out of next week alive, however. The scene between Sam and Jorah that immediately followed it was excellent as well. Jorah's actions lost him his ancestral family sword, but now he's redeemed himself enough to earn the Valyrian steel sword of House Tarly.Davos + Gilly: This scene really hit me in the feels. The little girl in the scene was shades of Shireen Baratheon, and any callback to her, especially in the context of her warm relationship with Davos, will get me. I really hope Davos lives.Jon + Dany: All things considered, Dany reacted about how I expected. Unfortunately, much of the fallout of this reveal will have to wait, as the Night King came knocking in the midst of it. That certainly points to both characters surviving the carnage of next week. I think the interaction between these two now that the cards are all on the table will be central to the back half of the season.Tyrion + Jaime + Brienne + Tormund + Davos + Pod: These scenes were the beating heart of this episode. As disparate a group of characters as we've ever seen assembled, defending a castle that is not their own, in defense of a family who most of them have made war upon. The episode gets its name from Jaime's knighting of Brienne, which is arguably, along with his apology to Bran, the solidification of his redemption arc. I still believe he has one more thing to do (*cough* KILL CERSEI *cough cough*), but he comes off as a true Knight of the Seven Kingdoms in this episode.Was it slow? Yes. Was there very little plot development? Yes.Did it show that these characters are why we love this show? Absolutely.Well done, Brian Cogman.", "At this late juncture in Thrones, one could be forgiven for making like Metallica and reminding our heroes in Winterfell that \u201cnothing else matters\u201d. But in the face of an excellent slow-burner like this week\u2019s episode, it is amply apparent as to why that view is wrong. Knowing and accepting that death is at the doorstep unsettles and levels us simultaneously. It is why we crave experiences we haven\u2019t had, yearn for lost time with loved ones, correct past mistakes that were never acknowledged and strive to be remembered as better people than we ever were. Ultimately, it is precisely in our last moments that every little thing begins to matter.It is within this contemplative setting that the latest episode of Thrones plays out.The Last HearthThrones has often been at its strongest when focusing not on the primary players but the characters who surround them. And now that dragons and white-walkers have rendered anyone who\u2019s not a Targaryen or Stark secondary, it is little surprise that this episode\u2019s best scenes come without either of these families\u2019 members.There are few faces in show-business currently on whom subtle changes in expression \u2014 be it surprise, relief or contentment \u2014 register as affectingly as they do on Nikolaj Coster-Waldau\u2019s. The man is a delight in all his scenes, and it will be a sad day if Bran\u2019s premonition about Jaime\u2019s uncertain long-term future comes true anytime soon.Tyrion, Tormund and Podrick remind us of what they do best. This is, in order: getting people drunk, merry and comfortable with each other; recounting bawdy, over-the-top tales while maintaining a progressive, feminist worldview; and displaying yet another hidden talent, which this time does not involve a \u201cmagic cock\u201d.But the shining light of this sequence is undoubtedly and deservedly Ser Brienne of Tarth. After soldiering on unflinchingly through several seasons of rejection, conflict and mockery, Brienne finds true acceptance in the exact manner that she craves and respects. Watching her experience true joy and finally smile widely has to rank up there with the show\u2019s most satisfying moments.A Stark ContrastBoth Sansa and Sophie Turner come into their own in this episode. Having picked up tactical nous from Littlefinger and evolved from the meek, gullible girl that she once was, Sansa deftly susses the underlying manipulation under Dany\u2019s friendly overtures and renders it impotent. Separately, Turner showcases genuine, unspoken tenderness in her scenes with Theon (the ever dependable and under-recognized Alfie Allen). Everything that they have endured and defeated makes their bond that much stronger, which is why it is a masterstroke by the director to play their reunion almost entirely off Dany\u2019s face. Shared trauma, it seems, inspires loyalty better than either fire or blood.In comparison, Arya and Maisie Williams have a really poor episode. Despite her current prowess with knives and arrows and her torturous \u201ctraining\u201d with the Faceless Men, Arya never feels like she has come of age. Mentally, she is still a child. Which is why it\u2019s first cringe-worthy and later plain discomforting watching her eye, seduce and get it on with Gendry, who is both older and much older-looking. This misstep casts the unwanted shadow of grooming on all of the duo\u2019s innocent scenes together earlier.Two other things were jarring about this episode: the yet-again rushed, expository dialogue to reveal Jon\u2019s parentage, and the show\u2019s odd decision to seemingly use a scene between Missandei and two young children to suddenly address race for the first time after 68 episodes.The Long ConThere is something very deliberate about the manner in which the wheels are coming off from underneath Dany\u2019s campaign trailer. Long hailed as the rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms, Dany seems increasingly ill-equipped for the job, as coronation day inches closer. And there have been signs all along that suggest Dany might not be what she thinks she is: from Daario and Olenna asking her to focus on being a conqueror to Sam casting aspersions on her character. As things stand, Jon has nobler intentions and a self-effacing quality, while Sansa seems more adept at matters of administration.It will therefore be interesting to see what the creators have in store for our Khaleesi: will they take the easy way out, having her seeing the light and become the ruler she was meant to be? Will they have her make the ultimate sacrifice and go out in a blaze of glory with the Night King? Will they be ballsy and have Dany become the final villain once the dust has settled? Or will they displace Dexter from the \u201cworst ending ever\u201d perch by having Dany retreat to Essos?Only four more episodes within which to find out.", "One of the finest episodes in the history of Game of Thrones.We have loved game of thrones for its laser sharp focus, sex, violence and interplay of an array of basic emotions. I am really glad the producers took some time away from all this, bringing almost all the major characters at the same location where it all began and just helped us understand them better.In my opinion what makes this episode so awesome is that it is the episode before an epic action packed battle where many are going to die. As the songs will be written by future generations for these heroes, the episode actually shows us so vividly why everyone is fighting and what exactly they are fighting for.One one hand we see \u201cmiserable old shits\u201d Beric Dondarion and the Hound Sandor Clegane. They have fought all their lives and now as old men they are probably fighting a battle they fully don\u2019t understand why they are fighting. Beric thinks it is the will of God but Sandor is simply hanging in there.Arya on other hand is young and has so much to live for. She wants to spend that time having sex, with Gendry. A night of passion before their deaths perhaps.The most beautiful moment for me however was of Sansa and Theon reunion. Both have together suffered at the hands of their captor Ramsay. They have shared a bond of misery. What is remarkable here is that while Dany\u2019s subject Yara would rather go back to Iron Islands, Theon out of his pure love for Starks would rather fight for Winterfell and die. It is perhaps a lesson for Dany that the Kings, Queens and Lords and Ladies have to earn that kind of loyalty and not demand it.Sansa has suffered so much that she can not trust anyone. She can not talk to anyone. Yet, she shares a moment with Theon. It was both ironical given that Theon sacked winterfell and betrayed her family in past.There were many other reunions in this episode. The campfire that Lady Brienne, Ser Jaime, Tyrion, Tormund, Davos, Podrick sit around is another brilliant scene. Lady Brienne\u2019s story arc completes at this stage. She is this strong women from the line of Ser Duncan the tall. She has struggled with her gender identity throughout her life. People called her lady but she wanted to be a soldier. She was gifted with the skills too and yet she never ever got the respect from any soldier. The only one to have given her respect is the gay king Renley Baratheon. When she gets knighted by Jaime, she gets the respect she deserves.Podrick is the one who finally sings a beautiful song showing us probably the skills that all whores of King\u2019s landing appreciated in past.As the Episode 3\u2019s battle gets all hyped, we are going to see at least some of these characters dying. I expect Brienne, Davos, Gilly, Sam, Jorah to die.Another noteworthy scene was between Jorah and Dany. Jorah has loved Dany so intensely that perhaps no one else has on this show. His love was not returned and yet he remains fiercely loyal to her and giving her some really good advice. It was perhaps his advice that made Dany go to Sansa to make amends.I am little conflicted about the scene between Jon and Dany. I was little surprised at Dany\u2019s reaction to Jon\u2019s big reveal. He is her nephew whom she has loved and had sex with. But she is more concerned about her throne rather than the fact that she is not the last Targaryan anymore. For whatever reason apple has fallen so very far from the line that also gave us Aemon Targaryan.One scene that could have been far better was between Bran and Jaime. It was too short."]}, "70": {"id": "s08e03", "name": "The Long Night", "script": "1 [.]   [WIND WHISTLING.]  [SAMWELL SHIVERING.]  NORTHMAN 1: Oi!  NORTHMAN 2: Mind out.  Move!

Bran Stark, guarded by Theon Greyjoy and the Ironborn, waits in the godswood to lure the Night King; indeed, the Night King, atop undead Viserion, notices that Bran has warged into flying ravens. The living retreat into Winterfell while Melisandre invokes her god and ignites the trench around it.  Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen engage the Night King with their dragons. Wights walk into the trench, their bodies serving as a bridge for other wights to cross and storm the castle. Lyanna Mormont stabs a wight giant in the eye with a dragonglass dagger, destroying him while he crushes her to death.  Beric Dondarrion sacrifices his final life to save Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane from wights. They find Melisandre, who says Beric was resurrected for a purpose now served, and repeats a prophecy she previously told Arya (\"The Climb\"); that she would \"shut many eyes forever\", emphasizing \"blue eyes\".  The Night King is dismounted and caught in Drogon's fire, but he is immune to it. He raises the dead Winterfell defenders and the Starks buried in the crypts. Jon is knocked off Rhaegal, as is Daenerys from Drogon. Daenerys fights wights alongside Jorah Mormont, who eventually succumbs to his wounds after the battle. Jon heads for the godswood but is blocked by Viserion.  The Night King arrives at the godswood for Bran and kills a charging Theon. Arya suddenly leaps at the Night King; he grabs her by the throat and dagger-wielding hand, but she drops her Valyrian steel dagger to her free hand and stabs him, destroying him and obliterating his army.  Melisandre, her purpose served, walks into the snow at dawn, removes her magical choker, and dies of old age as Davos watches."], "review": ["As usual, part recap, part review. And obvious spoilers are obvious. This is unchronological, stream of consciousness, gut reaction, by the way. Additional thoughts labeled as EDIT.We have a title now: The Long Night. Apropos.Holy shit.Arya Stark will never need to buy another beer in Westeros ever again.Holy shit.Hey now we know why Bran made a point of giving Arya that Valyrian steel dagger.That may have been the most intense 80-ish minutes of TV (or film, even) I\u2019ve ever seen.First off: I openly admit I had Melisandre pegged entirely wrong. I wondered where she was (and in hindsight it seems obvious she\u2019d show up right in the nick of time) and thought perhaps her focus on the Others had been a misdirection. Silly me.Was anyone else \u2026 surprised \u2026 that the Dothraki ended up being so absolutely useless? Like absolutely useless such that \u2026 why were they even there? How many of the wights everyone ended up fighting were just all those Dothraki? I think most of us probably saw the Dothraki as cannon fodder, but to that extent? Was that all of the Dothraki, apart from women and children? Are the Dothraki literally wiped out as a civilization now? (Does anyone care?) LOL they made this huge inspirational deal of Melisandre lighting up their arakhs and \u2026 it was a giant popcorn fart.EDIT: Thinking about the Dothraki more, it makes sense that they\u2019d flame out terribly. Why? Their potency is rooted in psychological terror. You see a bunch of screaming horsemen riding you down swinging sickles and yeah, you\u2019re gonna shit yourself and run and be mown down. But the wights don\u2019t know fear or self-preservation. They can\u2019t be psychologically cowed. So a Dothraki charge means nothing to them and in turn the Dothraki are deprived of what makes them effective. I think that\u2019s a large reason for why the Unsullied did comparably so much better; they\u2019re trained to withstand psychological trauma but also to be more effective in more tangible ways, i.e. they don\u2019t rely on unleashing terror to take down enemies but they\u2019re also less likely to cut and run in the face of an enemy like the wights.I just want to point out that we didn\u2019t actually see Ghost die. Ghost is probably dead. But we didn\u2019t see it. I can\u2019t tell if Ghost is actually alive still or if this is their way of killing him off with minimal CGI work. Neither would surprise me. EDIT: Someone pointed out that he\u2019s visible in the trailer next week and HE IS unless there\u2019s another wolf-shaped thing at Winterfell:LOL I would love to know the story of how Ghost goes from running with the Dothraki \u2014 literally like \u201cOh God he\u2019s gonna die isn\u2019t he\u201d \u2014 to apparently peacing the fuck out of there and I guess napping in the woods for the rest of the battle?I guess a new family has to get Bear Island now. I said earlier Lyanna Mormont was too awesome to live and, well. Glad she took out that wight giant beforehand.I would have liked to have seen more engagement with the Others themselves. After a certain point the wights were just kind of mind-numbing, you know? Seeing Jorah or Brienne or Arya fighting actual Others would have been cool.I cannot believe they did the dumbfuck zombie Starks thing. Yeah, wights are strong, but skeletons breaking out through goddamn stone? There were plenty of ways for the crypts to end up dangerous that didn\u2019t require that to happen. Like there are wights all the hell over the place, surely some of them can get into the crypt from above. As soon as that happened I said out loud, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201dTactically, I don\u2019t think the dragons were used all that well. (Blame Jon, I guess?) Like Dany brushing Jon off to go burn up wights is, without exaggeration, probably the best thing she\u2019s ever done. Why in the hell were the Dothraki sent into \u2026 that \u2026 when the dragons could have flown out early and wiped out the first few waves?Pretty much everyone I thought would live ended up living, but several people I thought were on the block \u2014 Grey Worm, Brienne, Davos, even Tormund, Podrick, Gendry or Gilly \u2014 also made it. Who\u2019d we lose? Lyanna Mormont, Edd, Jorah and Theon (probably the biggest character losses), and Beric. Did I miss anyone? It feels like someone else or a few someone elses should have died, right? The overall body count was massive, but the Big Players\u2019 body count was, considering the circumstances, pretty low, yes? EDIT: And Melisandre, duh.Now I will always wonder if the writers knew Arya would kill the Night King way back in season 3 when we got the \u201cblue eyes\u201d line, or if it just worked out that way. The callbacks there (that and \u201cnot today\u201d) were incredible. I\u2019m so glad Arya made it and so glad she ended up doing that.I\u2019m glad we got the dragons fighting. It looks like both Drogon and Rhaegal survived, which I was a bit surprised by. I figured Viserion would go, although I thought the living dragons would kill him. I also thought though that one of the two living dragons would be killed, likelier Drogon. (For everyone rooting for a mini Dance of the Dragons, stranger things have happened.)I\u2019d\u2019ve liked to have seen Sansa and Tyrion do a bit more down in the crypts, especially since Arya made such a point of giving Sansa a weapon. I did like their exchange though and their little moment while they were hiding. It was sweet, non-romantic (good) and a genuinely affectionate interaction.Varys did, again, virtually nothing. What are they holding onto him for? I thought his end might be tied in with Melisandre\u2019s, but apparently not.Melisandre going out into the snow to die felt \u201ccorrect,\u201d in that her work was done and she\u2019d finished what she\u2019d meant to do, but it also felt a bit unearned. I\u2019m turned off that the story seems to have validated her religious zealotry, and disappointed that she never really got any proper comeuppance for the terrible things she\u2019s done, namely killing Shireen. She got to show up in the eleventh hour, do what she\u2019d always wanted to do, and then die feeling accomplished. She didn\u2019t deserve it so good.I also have to admit \u2014 in conjunction with my takeaway that the dragons weren\u2019t used too well overall \u2014 I expected Jon and Dany to both do \u201cmore\u201d than they did. I know that seems odd given that they burned up a ton of wights, but \u2026 they didn\u2019t stop Viserion from landing in Winterfell, they didn\u2019t light up the trench, they didn\u2019t stop the wights from getting through the flaming trench. They provided cover for the retreat, but most of the big on-the-ground moments \u2014 the trench being lit, defending Bran in the godswood, holding the castle, and so on \u2014 fell to other people. They were overall supporting. I guess that should make me happy, as I\u2019d said before that dragons weren\u2019t the only way to fight the Others and they might have limited potency (see: the Night King withstanding Drogon\u2019s fire; who would have predicted that a few years ago?), but now I\u2019m wondering what the two of them will actually be doing in the future.Theon and Jorah\u2019s deaths were touching and earned. Bran telling Theon he was a \u201cgood man\u201d really got me, and I may think that Dany is probably Trouble but Jorah doesn\u2019t, so I\u2019m glad he got to go out defending her. That\u2019s how he\u2019d want to go, no doubt. He deserved to leave the way he\u2019d have wanted, and thank God they didn\u2019t turn him into mulch with the Dothraki.Even now I can feel my mind running ahead to the fallout. Like Grey Worm \u2014 they had to have been playing with the \u201ctwo days to retirement\u201d trope there, deliberately \u2014 and Missandei. They won, they both made it. Do they carry out the plan they made or does that fall by the wayside? Do Dany and Sansa start getting on better after this? Does Dany need to conscript surviving northmen to replace her army that\u2019s now been annihilated? Does she have to lean harder on having Drogon? Does Jaime stick around with Brienne?We should also step back and take stock of the Night King theories. Unless there\u2019s some double-cross coming, like Bran has to take over the Night King\u2019s mantle or be created as a \u201cnew\u201d Night King, the \u201cBran is the Night King\u201d theory looks pretty dead. We never did get to see who this figure really was or, really, what he actually wanted besides the sweeping explanation Bran gave last week. Does this mean the third \u201choly shit\u201d moment isn\u2019t related to the Others? Will we get more detail about the Others in the books? Whither the \u201cprince that was promised\u201d prophecy? Was it Jon just because Jon was in charge of this, did it fall by the wayside, or will it refer to something else entirely?Finally, the writers had two options here. They could have written this battle as being a loss, with the survivors having to evacuate and fight another way (and in another episode). Or they could have done a true self-contained battle. They went with the latter. That not only makes me wonder how the last half of the season will be filled (and it looks like the next episode takes place pretty quickly after the Winterfell battle, i.e. no time jump), but what will happen in episode 5, which Sapochnik is also directing. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s another battle episode; funny how it looks like nothing from after this battle made it into any of the promotional material. Why?EDIT: So uh what is Bran going to do now? Other than giving Arya the dagger last season (and in theory she could have done the same thing with obsidian, which everyone was given), did he even do anything? He has this absolutely immense power, apparently, and he \u2026 what? Uses a few ravens to see what\u2019s going on when that should already be obvious? Is he going to go back to his tree? Are we, sweet Jesus, actually going to get that ridiculous \u201cBran\u2019s the new Night King\u201d theory? Or is his actual utility spreading the truth about Jon?Final thoughts: Just really tremendous, technically and in terms of scale and characterization. Everyone got to have a moment and it felt like someone took Blackwater, Hardhome, Bastard Bowl and Castle Black and tossed them into a blender. It will take me a while to fully process it and I know I\u2019ll have to watch it again soon as I no doubt missed some stuff.", "I suppose this episode did leak after all \u2026\u2026 to a fictional character about a year and a half ago.The mystery of the blue raspberry sauce from undead Viserion is also cleared up \u2026\u2026 undead Viserion\u2019s fire is made of purest Fridge Logic.*Fridge Logic - TV TropesNo wonder Cersei had no concern whatsoever about the Night King and his Army of the Dead. It sounded scary. It sounded impressive. It should have been impressive \u2026. and then they were totally lamentable.The Night King and his Army of the Dead were so very shit that five minutes in the Dothraki were stadium-rock-arms-aloft ready to sing along with \u2018Candle in the Wind\u2019.The time before the Night King showed up was mostly devoted to trolling him.The Unsullied were probably all making the universally recognised \u2018Dickhead\u2019 gesture in unison, but the night being dark, and the Army of the Dead terrible ( - not in good way), saved the Night King a few blushes, should he ever get round to watching the action replay of whatever it was that happened at Winterfell.Battle feels like the wrong word.That the first five minutes were devoted to Sam miming that he ought to have put woolly gloves on, in a situation where Sam would totally have been wearing woolly gloves, was not a good sign.Sam spent much of the \u2018battle\u2019 doing the worm like a man who knows he\u2019s wearing plot armour.I suppose that he and the Dothraki must have been looking over Cersei\u2019s shoulder when she was reading about the magnitude of the Night King\u2019s lameness. It\u2019s a wonder that he ever managed to get to Season Eight.I think the Night King might be Victarion.If we take a step back to after Sam\u2019s my-hands-are-cold, but before Dothraki stadium-rock-arms-aloft ready to sing along with \u2018Candle in the Wind\u2019 and ask ourselves the question:Who lit the candle substitutes of the Dothraki to enable their stadium-rock-arms-aloft ready to sing along with \u2018Candle in the Wind\u2019 trolling of the Night King?That would be Melisandre who gave her presence away by having her pseudonym in the opening credits.She materialises on the field of play, walks up to the Dothraki, who forget they hate magic, and allow her to grope their arakhs whilst she\u2019s rhubarb-rhubarbing, and the rest is all \u2018rrrahh!\u2019 and Charge of the Lit-Up Brigade.Ser Davos, who will mistake himself for an air traffic controller in a world without aeroplanes in 3\u20132\u20131, looks disapprovingly in Melisandre\u2019s direction and then says:\u2018Open the gates!\u2019Of course he does.Tough luck Soup Girl - Davos forgot he was so invested in you.I guess he was looking over the Dothraki\u2019s shoulders a year and a half ago.\u2018No need to execute me, Ser Davos\u2019.I bet Charles I, Marie Antoinette, Joan of Arc are kicking themselves for not thinking of saying that prior to the curtailment of their respective lifetimes.Dany and Jon take to the air on Drogon and Rhaegal.They are flame-mowing the \u2018Army of the Dead\u2019 in stripes like they are the groundsmen at Lords\u2019 Cricket Ground \u2026\u2026 and here comes the Night King on Wight Viserion.The blasts of Blue Raspberry Sauce do not freeze or incinerate the humans fighting for the living, nor do they make them dead.The weather in the local area gets a bit inclement, but in a think-twice-about-having-a-picnic sort of way, rather than \u2018run for your life\u2019.Nor are the White Walkers particularly impressive.The White Walker Hippie Patrol comes forward, but they literally have no skills.They are more useless than the walking corpses.I am so glad that White Walker II - RIP, U is with with angles now - the greatest White Walker that ever was, or will be, died Beyond the Wall when to be a White Walker meant something. He would have hated to have seen how lame his brethen had become.Edd dies, whilst Sam is still doing the worm.Honestly, nobody ought to be dying from Team Winterfell here.Edd should not be dead and that one\u2019s on Sam.Every single one of the home team\u2019s deaths is totally unnecessary.Still, I suppose, that the \u2018Army of the Dead\u2019 have the numbers.There\u2019s a \u2018fall back\u2019 from Brienne and a \u2018close the gates\u2019 from, I don\u2019t know, maybe Tormund. Neither of them had better die. Not here. Not in this episode.The \u2018Army of the Dead\u2019 are strangely kept back by a knee-high perimeter of dragonglass and, yes, dragonglass doesn\u2019t agree with them, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s not easily hurdle-able. Dudes will climbing the sheer outer walls of Winterfell PDQ - and even before that, Melisandre will rhubarb-rhubarb that dragonglass on fire, which when the fire runs out, it will literally take one dead dude to break through the \u2018impenetrable\u2019 barrier.It would not take an undead human pyramid for them to get past ten minutes ago. One dead dude giving another dead dude a leg up would have been enough.They have a Giant for goodness sake.This is not rocket science, no matter how much Davos waves his landing sticks as if it were.There is drama in the Crypts.Tyrion: If we were out there, I might see something that someone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.Good luck with that. Most of the episode has no lighting.Tyrion: Remember the Battle of the Blackwater. I brought us through the Mud Gate. I might make a difference.Sansa: There\u2019s nothing you could do.Probably because there is no Mud Gate. And you wouldn\u2019t be able to see.Tyrion; You might be surprised at the lengths I\u2019d go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I can think of no organisation that\u2019s suited to my talents \u2026 [drinks]Are there any pubs left?Sansa: It\u2019s why we\u2019re down here.Tyrion: Maybe we should have stayed married?Sansa: You were the best of them.Tyrion: What a terrifying thought,Sansa: It wouldn\u2019t work between us.Tyrion: Why not?Sansa: The Dragon Queen. The divided loyalties would become a problem.Maybe Tyrion should become Sansa\u2019s Hand? The last two episodes signposted this pretty blatantly, but, then again, the last two episodes seemingly have no bearing upon this one, so it\u2019s well worth flogging that horse, yet again.There is drama in the Godswood.Theon: (with his bow) Bran, I just want you to know - I wish the things I did, everything you did, brought you to where you are now. Where you belong. Home.Bran: I\u2019m going away now.wtfTheon: Go where?Dreamy-look Bran catapults Angry Birds - three ravens - in the Night King\u2019s direction.If it were real history, he\u2019s only gone and sent the world\u2019s first Tweet.Cut to \u2018Battle\u2019.\u2018Army of the Dead\u2019 \u2018break through\u2019 the knee-high dragonglass and scale the walls.Davos says \u2018Man the walls!\u2019.Well, OK, then Davos, let\u2019s do that.Everybody is saving everybody else, but it\u2019s hard to see because no lighting in this episode. I think Brienne saves Jaime who saves her back. Gendry doing some good battering of dead dudes. Arya is like the Rat Sensei out of \u2018Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u2019 or the sword guy from Indiana Jones.Beric has his bloody fire sword.Arya decapitates some fools.I really didn\u2019t expect Melisandre to show up until Beric had carked it. Wouldn\u2019t have blamed her to be honest - she\u2019d probably be religiously obliged to talk to him, and who the hell would voluntarily talk to Beric? He is so boring that nobody has ever asked him about his fire sword.The Hound has mistaken himself for Lurkfinger. He, and the backside of a vertical pillar, have been inseparable since the episode started. Beric presumes to chide him.Beric: Clegane, we need you. You can\u2019t give up on us.The Hound: We\u2019re fighting death. You can\u2019t beat death.Beric: Tell her that.Whatever.The Hound is more scared of being stuck with Beric than of fire - and he is really scared of fire. Unfortunately, despite leaving his lurking spot, he is soon back-to-back bro-ing with Beric - though that doesn\u2019t stop Beric yapping, not at all - but the good news is that Beric dies, and the Hound saves Arya, so everyone\u2019s a winner in the end.Arya has some more shenanigans in dark corridors.There is running, crashing, panting and so on, but though we\u2019ve had the words from the trailer last episode whilst holding a dagger and can add the legging it down a corridor, we still haven\u2019t seen her drawing back a bow with a fire arrows loaded, so she can expect to find herself back down there again, at least once, before the Season is out.But first, it\u2019s a chat with Melisandre, which kicks off with mutual agreement that each of them knows the other. No time for celebration though.Arya: You said we\u2019d meet again.Melisandre: And here we are - at the end of the world.So much for her prophetic skills. She must have been the only person who didn\u2019t get a shufty at the plot for this episode eighteen months ago. Which is weird because Volantis is only an ad break away in terms of travelling time.Arya: \u2026 as we know it \u2026 and I feel fine.Not really.Arya: You said I\u2019d shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.Melisandre: Brown eyes, green eyes and blue eyes.We\u2019ll pretend they didn\u2019t shame themselves with the Syrio Forel callback.Blue eyes, eh?Here they come. Steady lads. Make every shot count.Theon has the entire population of the Iron Islands with him in the Godswood. I count all six as present.Yara is ruling seaweed, I guess.Here they come. The Night King flying Viserion.Oo-err missus - the Night King\u2019s got his Ice Spear out. Cheeky.Since no-one\u2019s mentioned their cock this episode, he didn\u2019t have a choice.Some Dragon-on-Dragon action - this is desperate stuff - and Jon is grounded. Davos can wave his landing lights all he likes.Dany gives the Night King the full \u2018Dracarys\u2019 treatment, like the Night King gives any kind of a shit about it. He strides through the dragonfire with his golf-bag strapped to his back.The Night King looks smug.Surely he\u2019d have picked a stronger look for his first ever facial expression?He\u2019s smiling.What the fuck is that? In case he hasn\u2019t noticed, his army is a bag of crap, his White Walkers may as well be doing the worm and the only person of significance they\u2019ve taken out is a 10 year old girl - and it took an actual Giant to do it.He has brought nothing, but shame upon whatever House he is.Well, alright, they just got Jorah.I thought Jorah was dead twice before he actually was and couldn\u2019t work out why nobody was upset. Personally, I\u2019m outraged: he, Lyanna and Edd - but not Beric - were worth more than dying in this \u2026 whatever it was.There\u2019s also a weird moment where Jon is sheltering from Viserion\u2019s blue raspberry sauce that does nothing, only to run out to grab a sword when he is already holding one.Jon then runs up to the Night King\u2019s back, the Night King turns round, does a half-assed arm raise and there\u2019s some flicking open of blue eyes, but not much of anything, and the Night King just walks off, like, the writers have got to Baelish me in the Godswood, so off I go.The GodswoodThe six Ironborn are defeated in more than 10 seconds, which has to worry the White Walker Hippy Patrol who walked in under the arch, as if filming their final video as an aging, desperate boyband before they split and pretend it\u2019s due to \u2018artistic differences,\u2019Not content with wasting the lives of Edd, Jorah and Lyanna, but not Beric, we lose Theon too, but he went out as he would wanted at the completion of his redemption arc, which is some sort of comfort.The string arrangement playing in the background becomes somewhat jauntier. Really, anything could happen. I mean, the Night King\u2019s going to lose, that\u2019s been clear since Sam and his disingenuous lack of gloves, but, still, anything could happen. All the episodes before have meant nothing at all.It\u2019s Arya.She runs up to the Night King and stabs a fool.Be in no doubt, Season Eight Episode Three Night King, is a fool.(not to detract from Arya\u2019s achievement there: she\u2019s a badass)The Night King disintegrates like a wet fart \u2026\u2026 and it\u2019s contagious.The White Walker Hippy Patrol, the \u2018Army of the Dead\u2019, and poor Viserion wet-fart their way out of existence too.Melisandre takes off her ruby necklace, drops in the snow like \u2018fuck this\u2019 - and she disintegrates too. I don\u2019t blame her.I\u2019m probably missing something here, but I thought the episode was just awful. There was a Battle at Winterfell, but it wasn\u2019t for Winterfell.Here are the Starks, who have for millenia kept watch for \u2018Winter is Coming\u2019 - for generations, their home was where Winter when it came was meant to fall. It should have been meaningful, yet it didn\u2019t feel like anything at all.Perhaps it will be meaningful going forward.Apart from Theon - \u2018Theon, you\u2019re a good man\u2019 - with Bran, it felt \u2026 I don\u2019t know, but it should have been something.Surely?However \u2026Season Eight Episode Three Night King did not deserve a Benny Hill chase.Season Eight Episode Three Night King would have been shocked by the first pert blonde in a bikini, offered her a cardigan, then tripped over his own arse and died, before the newsagent had even rolled up his paper to pretend it was a truncheon.Season Eight Episode Three Night King deserves to go out to \u2018You Just Haven\u2019t Earned It Yet, Baby\u2019 by The Smiths, but we deserve it, as sung by the great Kirsty MacColl.*Fridge Logic\u2018Half an hour after the show is over, a random viewer is staring into his refrigerator, vaguely bemused by the fact that his six-pack of beer has somehow become a two-pack of beer. Rather than work out how this might have happened, it occurs to him to wonder how in the hell Sydney Bristow went from Hungary to Melbourne, Australia, then to LA, all within 24 hours.It didn't bother him during the show. It wasn't until he discovered he was running short of beer that it became an issue.Fridge Logic has been the writer's-room term for these little Internal Consistency issues for a good while, as in \"Don't sweat the Fridge Logic, we've got bigger fish to fry. We've only got 20 minutes left to work in three costume changes, a foreign language, and a weird wig.\" It refers to some illogical or implausible plot point that the audience doesn't realize during the show, but only long afterwards. This naming is highly subjective, since not every person follows the same train of thought. Some people will never even realise there was a problem, while others will call it a Plot Hole, since they already noticed the problem during the show\u2019Fridge Logic - TV Tropes", "It\u2019s really difficult for me to write a review the way it should be written. But I will try,First of all, I have two \u201cpersonal\u201d issues. You can skip these, if you want. a) Sky Austria streamed the US broadcast via Sky X\u2026 well, the streaming was interrupted at the moment of Jon\u2019s charge on foot. Then it reprised but sound only. Then the episode was put up on demand\u2026 still no image. I had to resort to old Sky Ticket to watch the ending. Sky Austria is going to get my rage. b) Both in episode 2 and in this episode my friends agreed with me that the showrunners seemed to have copied parts of my fanfiction \u201cThe song of the bear who was a fool\u201d written with the nickname Black-and-Pink Unicorn Guardian, written two years ago. Coincidence or they really copied it? Especially the Arya parts\u2026 who knows!*At some points, I think they nailed the atmosphere\u2026 fear, claustrophobia, useless strategies against supernatural powers\u2026 the music. Then they really ruined it all by making it all impossible to see. Too dark, too messy. Many disappointing things.The Dothraki being annihilated was on one hand a powerful scene, because it set the atmosphere. On the other hand, it screamed \u201cthe showrunners never even read a single book on warfare\u201d. But\u2026 hey, most of us hated them. It reminded me of the useless charges of the Italians on the Isonzo against Austrian machine guns in World War One, anyway. Maybe that was what they were going for, who knows.The Dothraki being annihilated also makes Daenerys less powerful. I have the impression that even the Unsullied aren\u2019t that many.Lyanna went down as a hero, and went down in a way that reminded in part her sister Dacey (you can read about her death in the books - she, too, tries to do something before getting killed).I am still convinced that Melisandre\u2019s necklace, hitting the ground, resurrected Jorah. (Denial or genius? :-) ) Jorah died mouthing \u201cI \u2026 love\u201d (either that, or sleeping only 40 minutes last night hasn\u2019t been a good idea). EDIT: I am not talking of when he hits the ground. When he hits the ground, he mouths \u201cI am hurt\u201d. Then he mouths something in Daenerys\u2019s arms, and it really looks like \u201cI love you\u201d. Why wouldn\u2019t it be those words?I also would like to remind this fandom that the most romantic scenes on the show were all between Jorah and Daenerys. Daenerys crying like that? Never seen. Drogon coming to mourn his father? Remember that, both in book-verse and show-verse, we only had the dragons because Jorah picked up Daenerys and brought her into that tent. Also, Jorah was the first man to see the dragons and to be seen by them. Powerful scene, and - incredibly - Emilia Clarke nailing it.Jon was\u2026 useless? I mean, even Daenerys did more. Daenerys stabbing zombies alongside Jorah was epic! Jon was\u2026 what was Jon, exactly?To be honest, I think letting Grey Worm, Jaime, and Brienne all survive is unrealistic. And I think there were other survivors as well. We will see.All in all, not bad, but it felt too\u2026 stretched out, sorry to say that. Two minutes of stares directed at Theon, and then again between the NK and Bran? Jon escaping yet another mass of zombies?And I still have to get over the fact that it really looks like D&D copied my fanfiction\u2026I might write more and proofread after I have slept a little. Greetings from Austria, where it\u2019s 6:15 am!*Line about Arya looking forward to seeing this face of death + some things from my battle schemes, albeit in a dumbed down version + Arya killing the NK with the dagger were published in this fic of mine. The Song of the Bear who was a Fool / https://www.fanfiction.net/s/126... . Coincidence?", "The night is dark and full of SPOILERSDon\u2019t spend half an hour messing with the brightness settings on your TV \u2014 being able to see jack shit was intentional. I suppose it did contribute to the ambiance but I struggled to follow some parts.The dothraki mounting a suicidal charge was pretty dumb. It just gave the enemy many more units.A bit weird how Melisandre got a (reasonably) \u201chappy ending\u201d and no comeuppance for burning little girls alive.I predicted Edd and Beric kicking the bucket and was feeling pretty good about myself but Grey Worm beat the odds. Jorah got to die saving Dany so he probably jizzed in his pants with fulfillment.Why was Bran being guarded by Theon and his 10 mates away from everyone else? I feel sorry for Theon\u2019s mates getting that job.RIP Theon. Definitely one of my top 3 male characters without a cock on the show.Bran was a real letdown. Didn\u2019t contribute anything really. (I guess he knew what would happen, but I thought he\u2019d have some kind of visual showdown with the Night King at least.)I feel like Jon and Dany half-assed it with the dragons a bit. Close quarters battle is more exciting for the audience though so that\u2019s probably why more wights weren\u2019t dragon fodder.Arya hiding from the wights was pretty tense. Good stuff.Is it bad that I always want Sam to get killed?The death of the Night King (and white walkers) seemed a bit anticlimactic but I guess that was the point. Probably misdirection ahead of the real finale, whatever that is.Is there going to be a happy ending only for Varys to screw things up for everyone at the end? I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s still alive and hasn\u2019t done anything for so long.I just want Jaime to kill Cersei, and Cleganebowl. Please?", "I\u2019m pretty thrilled honestly. It was a big fight, and Sapochnik captured a dark mood in a way that felt uniquely dark and dangerous without becoming oppressive and dull.Things I loved:The Catspaw dagger came full circle: a Stark saved Bran from it and a Stark saved Bran with it.Pretty sure I can count the season as a success now after Arya\u2019s moment.Lyanna Mormont is a fucking legend, holy shit.Jorah Mormont went out on exactly the right note.The Mormont line ending makes me feel profoundly sad and proud, like I just witnessed a legend in the making over the course of the series with Jeor/Jorah/Lyanna.So much love for Theon.The Unsullied were the fucking bomb. I felt like they totally lived up to the hype about being the best infantry in the world.Really happy about Grey Worm, surprisingly. His storyline has felt like a labor lately, but this battle breathed new life into it.Things I\u2019m scratching my head about:TNK reanimating corpses in the crypt seemed gratuitous and dumb to me. We know stuff about how corpses are treated by Silent Sisters that contradicts the idea that this could happen. Disappointed by this; surely there was a better way to raise the stakes for Sansa & Co.What was Bran doing during the whole battle? Was he warging somewhere? Why show him warging crows if he wasn\u2019t able to do anything?Dolorous Edd went out on an unworthy line. I really expected a better quip for his last words.I\u2019m really surprised the dragons both made it and Jon & Dany didn\u2019t get into it.We\u2019ll never know what the deal was with there being 13 Others?No explanation about the Night King\u2019s history or relationship with the Starks/Three Eyed Raven. I don\u2019t buy the idea that the Children of The Forest created The Others because it seems inconsistent with the books, so maybe this is for the best."]}, "71": {"id": "s08e04", "name": "The Last Of The Starks", "script": "1 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS)   Who would you say is the father?

Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.  That's very diligent. Very responsible.  - Piss off. - You know the first thing  I learned in the North?  I hate the fucking North.  It grows on you.  I don't want things growing on me.  How about Tormund Giantsbane?  Has he grown on you?  He was very sad when you left.  You sound quite jealous.  I do, don't I?  It's bloody hot in here.  [CHUCKLES.]  [.]  Oh, move aside.  What are you doing?  I'm taking your shirt off.  I've never slept with a knight before.  I've never slept with anyone before.  Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.  I told you--  [WIND WHISTLING.]  Are you drunk?  No.  [CHUCKLES.]  Only a little.  [SIGHS.]  I didn't know Ser Jorah well  but I know this.  If he could have chosen a way to die,  it would have been protecting you.  He loved me.  And I couldn't love him back.  Not the way he wanted.  Not the way I love you.  Is that all right?  [SIGHS.]  I wish you'd never told me.  If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.  I try to forget.  Tonight I did for a while,  and then I saw them gathered around you.  I saw the way they looked at you.  I know that look.  So many people have looked at me that way, but never here.  Never on this side of the sea.  I told you I don't want it.  It doesn't matter what you want.  You didn't want to be King in the North.  What happens when they demand you press your claim,  and take what is mine?  I'll refuse.  You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.  You can say nothing.  To anyone, ever.  Never tell them who you really are.  Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,  and tell no one else.  Or it will take on a life of its own  and you won't be able to control it  or what it does to people.  No matter how many times you bend the knee,  no matter what you swear.  I want it to be the way it was between us.  I have to tell Sansa and Arya.  Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.  She won't.  She's not the girl you grew up with.  Not after what she's seen,  not after what they've done to her.  I owe them the truth.  Even if the truth destroys us?  - It won't. - It will.  I've never begged for anything  but I'm begging you.  [SOFTLY.] Don't do this. Please.  You are my queen.  Nothing will change that.  And they are my family.  We can live together.  We can.  I've just told you how.  [.]  [SIGHS.]  Half are gone.  The Northmen as well.  And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing,  courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.  The balance has grown distressingly even.  When the people find out what we have done for them,  that we saved them--  Cersei will make sure they don't believe it.  We will hit her hard.  We will rip her out root and stem.  The objective here is to remove Cersei  without destroying King's Landing.  VARYS: Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day.  Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands  in her queen's name.  The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.  No matter how many lords turn against her,  as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,  she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  We need the capital.  I watched the people of King's Landing  rebel against their king when they were hungry,  and that was before winter began.  Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.  JON: We'll surround the city.  If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food,  the dragons will destroy them.  If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack,  we'll defeat them in the field.  Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy,  her reign is over.  All right.  SANSA: The men we have left are exhausted.  Many of them are wounded.  They'll fight better if they have time  to rest and recuperate.  How long do you suggest?  SANSA: I can't say for certain,  not without talking to the officers.  I came north to fight alongside you  at great cost to my armies and myself.  Now that the time has come to reciprocate,  you want to postpone.  It's not just our people. It's yours.  You want to throw them into a war  they're not ready to fight?  The longer I leave my enemies alone,  the stronger they become.  [.]  The Northern forces will honor their promises  and their allegiance  to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  What you command, we will obey.  TYRION: So  if all are in agreement  Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad  with the Northern troops  and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.  A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor,  and sail from there to Dragonstone  with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.  Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,  as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.  We have won the Great War.  Now we will win the Last War.  In all Seven Kingdoms,  men will live without fear and cruelty  under their rightful queen.  We need a word.  You understand we'd all be dead if not for her.  We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.  Arya's the one that killed the Night King.  Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--  And we will never forget them.  That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--  I swore myself and the North to her cause.  I respect that.  You respect it?  We needed her.  We needed her army, her dragons.  You did the right thing.  And we're doing the right thing telling you  we don't trust your queen.  - You don't know her yet. - I'll never know her.  She's not one of us.  If you only trust the people you grew up with,  you won't make many allies.  That's all right.  I don't need many allies.  - JON: Arya - We're family.  The four of us.  The last of the Starks.  I've never been a Stark.  SANSA: You are.  You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.  You're my brother.  Not my half-brother or my bastard brother.  My brother.  It's your choice.  I need to tell you something.  But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.  What is it?  You have to swear it, before I tell you.  How can I promise to keep a secret  if I don't even know what it is?  Because we're family.  Swear it.  I swear it.  I swear it.  Tell them.  TYRION: So she's going to stay here with you?  She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so  Say something snide.  I'm happy.  I'm happy that you're happy.  I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.  [LAUGHS.]  Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes?  To climbing mountains. [CUPS CLINK.]  To climbing mountains.  - What's she like down there? - What?  That's not your concern.  I haven't been with a woman for years.  - Give me a morsel. - You're a dog.  I am the Imp, and I demand to know.  BRONN: I knew you were fucking her.  A pair of tall, blond toffs.  Must be like looking in the mirror.  TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.  Where's your drink?  What are you-- What are you doing up North?  What are you doing with that?  Oh, this?  This is for you.  For both of you.  TYRION: You're supposed to be south.  You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.  - Do you know that? - That's a bit rude.  Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit,  - and what do I have to show? - You're a knight, thanks to me.  Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much  as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.  Power resides where men believe--  BRONN: Shut your mouth.  - TYRION: I'm just trying-- - I've never hit a dwarf before,  but say another word and I will belt you.  See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--  You couldn't do it on your best day,  you one-handed fuck.  And your best days are long gone.  [GROANS.] You broke my nose!  - I did not break your nose. - How do you know?  Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size,  and I know what it sounds like. Now listen.  Your sister offered me Riverrun.  Nice big castle, good lands,  plenty of peasants who do what they're told.  - And you trust Cersei-- - I knew your sister was dead  the second I saw those dragons.  Now, your army may be torn to shit,  but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win.  And it just so happens I'm a betting man.  If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.  Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change  if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead.  Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one.  - All of a sudden - TYRION: May I speak?  Why not? Only death will shut you up.  We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?  If anyone offered me money  to kill you, you'd pay me double.  What's double Riverrun?  Highgarden.  You could be Lord of the Reach.  - Highgarden? Are you mad? - It's better than being dead.  He's not going to kill us.  He wouldn't be talking to us if--  The way I see it,  I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.  Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.  BRONN: No? Who were your ancestors,  the ones who made your family rich?  Fancy lads in silk?  They were fucking cutthroats.  That's how all the great houses started, isn't it?  With a hard bastard who was good at killing people.  Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord.  Kill a few thousand, they make you king.  And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family  with their cocksucking ways.  Highgarden.  Give me your word.  You have my word.  None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing.  We ride south in the morning.  We could use an officer  with knowledge of the city's defenses.  [CHUCKLES.] Oh, no.  No, my fighting days are done.  But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me?  I'll come find you when the war is done.  Till then, don't die.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  For fuck's sake.  On your own?  HOUND: Not anymore.  I don't like crowds.  ARYA: Me neither.  HOUND: Why not? They all love you now.  You're the big hero.  Don't like heroes.  It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.  Felt better than dying.  You're heading to King's Landing?  I have some unfinished business.  Me too.  I don't plan on coming back.  Neither do I.  Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?  Probably.  [CHUCKLES.]  [.]  [GROWLING SOFTLY.]  My lady.  \"My lord\" is the standard response.  Why her?  TYRION: You know she loves your brother.  That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.  You seem determined to dislike her.  A good relationship  between the Iron Throne and the North  has been the core of every peaceful,  prosperous reign we've ever known.  Jon will be Warden of the North,  so a good relationship seems likely.  I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.  Well, I suppose that's up to him.  Sansa, look at me.  With Jon in the capital,  you'll be the true power in the North.  I'd feel much better about the future  if I left here today believing  that you and Daenerys were allies.  What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him.  Your queen still has her dragons--  She's your queen too.  You don't have to be her friend.  But why provoke her?  How is that in the best interest of your family,  - or the North, or--? - You're afraid of her.  Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.  I don't want Jon to go down there.  The men in my family don't do well in the capital.  No, but as your brother once told me,  he's not a Stark.  [SIGHS.]  Are you all right?  [.]  Her people love her, you've seen that.  You've seen how they fight for her.  She wants to make the world a better place.  I believe in her.  Tyrion.  What if there's someone else?  Someone better?  You're not gonna ride the dragon south?  Just a horse.  Rhaegal needs to heal.  He doesn't need me weighing him down.  [SCOFFS.] You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.  [CHUCKLES.]  I'm taking the Free Folk home.  We've had enough of the south.  The women down here don't like me.  This is the North, you know.  And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.  It isn't home.  We need room to wander.  I'll take them back through Castle Black  as soon as the winter storms pass.  Back where we belong.  It's where he belongs too.  A direwolf has no place in the south.  Will you take him with you?  He'll be happier up there.  So would you.  I wish I was going with you.  This is farewell, then.  You never know.  You've got the North in you.  The real North.  Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer  and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown.  There's only so many books a person can read, so we--  I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.  If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.  I hope it's a girl.  [.]  [SNIFFLES.]  [BOTH SNIFFLE.]  You're the best friend I ever had.  You too, Sam.  [GHOST WHINES.]  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]  TYRION: Think of the past 20 years.  The war, the murder, the misery.  All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone  who didn't love him back.  How many others know?  Including us? Eight.  Well, then it's not a secret anymore.  It's information.  If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon.  Then what happens?  She loses the North.  She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.  No, it's worse than that.  He has the better claim to the throne.  He doesn't want the throne.  I'm not sure it matters what he wants.  The fact is, people are drawn to him.  Wildlings, Northmen.  He's a war hero.  He loves our queen.  And she loves him.  If we marry them, they could rule together.  She's his aunt.  That never stopped a Targaryen before.  No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.  Is marrying your aunt common in the North?  You know our queen better than I do.  Do you think she wants to share the throne?  She does not like to have her authority questioned.  Something she has in common  with every monarch who ever lived.  I worry about her state of mind.  We are advisors to the queen.  Worrying about her state of mind is our job.  We still have to take King's Landing.  Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.  That would solve our problems.

QYBURN: Your people have heard the Usurper is coming.  They are grateful for your protection  within the walls of the Red Keep.  You're certain about the dragon?  I saw it sink beneath the waves.  That must have been glorious.  The glory is yours, my queen.  When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land,  the Kraken shall rule the sea  and our child shall one day rule them all.  [.]  [CHUCKLES.]  [SOFTLY.] She's coming for you.  Of course she is.  Keep the gates open.  If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder  thousands of innocent people first.  So much for \"the Breaker of Chains.\"  [MISSANDEI PANTING.]  GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen.  We will kill your enemies. All of them.  VARYS: Your Grace.  I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly  if I ever thought you were making a mistake.  This is a mistake.  You saw my child fall from the sky.  They took Missandei.  VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed,  but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied  and the Dothraki,  tens of thousands of innocents will die.  That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep.  These are the people you came here to protect.  I beg you, Your Grace.  Do not destroy the city you came to save.  Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.  Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys?  I'm here to free the world from tyrants.  That is my destiny  and I will serve it, no matter the cost.  It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies  make it to King's Landing.  In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender.  Offer her her life in exchange for the throne.  If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter,  we should make the effort.  Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter.  But perhaps it's good the people see  that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed,  and Cersei Lannister refused.  They should know whom to blame  when the sky falls down upon them.  [.]  I've served tyrants most of my life.  They all talk about destiny.  She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones  and walked out with three dragons.  How could she not believe in destiny?  Perhaps that's the problem.  Her life has convinced her  that she was sent here to save us all.  And how do you know she wasn't?  Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.  Perhaps it's actually a solution.  You know them both.  Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?  He doesn't want the throne.  That's why he bent the knee.  Have you considered the best ruler  might be someone who doesn't want to rule?  We're discussing treason.  Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.  Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.  He's temperate and measured. He's a man,  which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros,  whose support we are going to need.  Joffrey was a man.  I don't think a cock is a true qualification,  as I'm sure you'd agree.  And he's the heir to the throne.  Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.  What about my earlier proposal?  They could rule together as king and queen.  She's too strong for him.  She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.  He could temper her worst impulses.  As you have?  You're drinking quite a lot.  A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.  Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able  to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.  How many kings and queens have you served?  Five? Six? I've lost count.  - You've always known my reasons. - At a certain point,  you choose a person you believe in,  and you fight for that person.  Even if you know it's a mistake?  I believe in our queen.  She'll make the right choice.  With the help of her loyal advisors.  You know where my loyalty stands.  You know I will never betray the realm.  What is the realm?  A vast continent, home to millions of people,  most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.  Millions of people, many of whom will die  if the wrong person sits on that throne.  We don't know their names,  but they're just as real as you and I.  They deserve to live.  They deserve food for their children.  I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.  So, what happens to her?  Please.  Don't.  I've spoken as honestly as I can.  Each of us has a choice to make.  I pray we choose wisely.  [.]  [MAN GRUNTS.]  MAN 1: I'm just about to start it.  WOMAN 1: Good luck.  MAN 2: Protect shell right up to the wall.  MAN 1: All right, I'll put another one on it.  MAN 3: He's headed down to the cellar.  I'll need a cart over here.  MAN 4: That's it, thanks.  Thank you.  WOMAN 2: It's really heavy, mind you.  MAN 5: We need some more water.  MAN 3: Take it down there!  as are the rest of her advisors.  What happened?  Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet.  One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed,  Missandei captured.  I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.  Seems like I won't get the chance.  [.]  [DOOR CLOSES.]  They're going to destroy that city.  You know they will.  JAIME: Have you ever run away from a fight?  You're not like your sister. You're not.  You're better than she is.  You're a good man and you can't save her.  You don't need to die with her.  Stay here.  Stay with me.  [VOICE BREAKING.] Please.  Stay.  [.]  You think I'm a good man?  I pushed a boy out a tower window,  crippled him for life  for Cersei.  I strangled my cousin with my own hands  just to get back to Cersei.  I would have murdered  every man, woman and child in Riverrun  for Cersei.  [INHALES SHARPLY.]  She's hateful.  And so am I.  [SOBBING.]  [HORSE NEIGHS.]  [BREATHING SHAKILY.]  [SOLDIER SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY.]  [GATE RATTLING.]  My lord.  Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender  and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.  Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender.  If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.  Qyburn  you're a rational man.  Or so I flatter myself, my lord.  We have a chance here,  perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.  Yes.  Help me.  I don't want to see this city burn.  I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.  No, it is not a pleasant sound.  I-- I don't want to hear it.  Help me save this city.  My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.  TYRION: Your queen.  Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  You are her subject.  Her reign is over.  You understand this. Help her understand it.  We understand nothing of the sort.  Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.  Your armies are battle-weary and depleted,  while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan--  [.]  CAPTAIN: Ready!  Nock!  Draw!  [INHALES DEEPLY.]  [.]  I know you don't care about your people.  Why should you?  They hate you and you hate them.  But you're not a monster.  I know this.  I know this because I've seen it.  You've always loved your children.  More than yourself,  more than Jaime  more than anything.  I beg you.  If not for yourself, then for your child.  Your reign is over,  but that doesn't mean your life has to end.  It doesn't mean your baby has to die.  [EXHALES SHAKILY.]  If you have any last words, now is the time.

Even if you know it's a mistake?  He has the better claim to the throne.  CERSEI LANNISTER: Every time a Targaryen is born,  the gods flip a coin.  BARRISTAN SELMY: The Mad King gave his enemies the justice  he thought they deserved.  TYRION: Children are not their fathers.  - OLENNA TYRELL: Be a dragon. - JORAH MORMONT: You have a gentle heart.  AEMON TARGARYEN: A Targaryen alone in the world  is a terrible thing.  VISERYS TARGARYEN: You don't want to awake the dragon, do you?  (MUSIC INTENSIFIES)    [KNOCK ON DOOR.]  Come in.  [DOOR OPENS.]  And?  Nothing?  She won't eat.  [.]  We'll try again at supper.  I think they're watching me.  - Who? - Her soldiers.  Of course they are. That's their job.  What have I told you, Martha?  The greater the risk, the greater the reward.  Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]  VARYS: The Northern armies?  JON: Just crossed the Trident.  They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days.  How is she?  She hasn't seen anyone since we returned.  Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.  She shouldn't be alone.  You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.  Aren't you worried for her?  I'm worried for all of us.  They say every time a Targaryen is born,  the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.  We're not much for riddles where I'm from.  We both know what she's about to do.  [SIGHS.]  That's her decision to make. She is our queen.  Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.  What do you want?  All I've ever wanted.  The right ruler on the Iron Throne.  I still don't know how her coin has landed.  But I'm quite certain about yours.  I don't want it.  I never have.  [SIGHS.]  I have known more kings and queens than any man living.  I've heard what they say to crowds,  and seen what they do in the shadows.  I have furthered their designs, however horrible.  But what I tell you now is true:  You will rule wisely and well, while she--  She  is my queen.  [.]  [EXHALES SOFTLY.]  Your Grace?  There's something you need to know.  Someone has betrayed me.  Yes.  Jon Snow.  Varys.  He knows the truth about Jon.  He does.  Because you told him.  You learned from Sansa.  And she learned from Jon,  though I begged him not to tell her.  As I said  he betrayed me.  TYRION: I'm glad Sansa told me.  I am your Hand.  I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.  And Varys?  Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.  You spoke to him first.  Without coming to me.  Without asking my permission.  It was a mistake.  Why do you think Sansa told you?  What do you think she hoped to gain?  - She trusts me. - Yes, she trusts you.  She trusted you to spread secrets  that could destroy your own queen.  And you did not let her down.  [.]  If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me.  Our intentions were good.  We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us.  Varys as much as anyone.  But it doesn't matter now.  No.  It doesn't matter now.  [DOOR OPENS.]  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.]  [EXHALES HEAVILY.]  [.]  It was me.  I hope I deserve this.  Truly, I do.  I hope I'm wrong.  [INHALES AND EXHALES SHARPLY.]  Goodbye, old friend.  Lord Varys.  [INHALES SHARPLY.]  I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,  First of My Name,  Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons  sentence you to die.  [GROWLING.]  Dracarys.  [ROARS.]  [GROWLS.]  [.]  This was all she brought with her  when we crossed the Narrow Sea.  Her only possession.      happen if you told your sister?  I don't want it, and that's what I told him.  She betrayed your trust.  She killed Varys as much as I did.  This was a victory for her.  Now she knows what happens  when people hear the truth about you.  Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.  I don't have love here.  I only have fear.  I love you.  And you will always be my queen.  Is that all I am to you?  Your queen?  [JON EXHALES HEAVILY.]  [SOFTLY.] All right, then.  Let it be fear.  TYRION: The people who live there, they're not your enemies.  They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.  DAENERYS: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters  and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.  TYRION: They're afraid.  Anyone who resists Cersei  will see his family butchered.  You can't expect them to be heroes.  - They're hostages. - They are.  In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?  What does it matter whose fault it is?  Thousands of children will die if the city burns.  Your sister knows how to use  her enemies' weaknesses against them.  That's what she thinks our mercy is:  weakness.  - I beg you, my queen-- - But she's wrong.  Mercy is our strength.  Our mercy towards future generations  who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.  Ready the Unsullied.  Tonight you sail for King's Landing  - to join the Northern armies. - Cersei's followers  will abandon her if they know the war is lost.  Give them that chance.  - [INHALES SHARPLY.] - If the city surrenders,  they will ring the bells and raise the gates.  Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.  DAENERYS: Wait for me outside the city.  You'll know when it's time.  DAENERYS: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.  [.]  It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all.  The next time you fail me  will be the last time you fail me.  [DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES.]  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  GUARD 1: Let them pass.  [BABY CRYING.]  GUARD 2: Through the gate.  GUARD 3: Get going.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  DAVOS: The rearguard should be here by daybreak.  TYRION: She wants to attack now.  Daybreak at the earliest.  SOLDIER 1: Careful with that. SOLDIER 2: My lord.  TYRION: Davos.  I need to ask you a favor.  You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?  I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?  SOLDIER 1: He's always better when he's got some food in him.  SOLDIER 2: Problem is when he's got drink in him.  See what he did the other week?  SOLDIER 1: Aye. Fighting as well.  Commander nearly caught him.  Ay up. Where you going?  I'm Arya Stark.  I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.  Think about it.  She kills Cersei, the war's over.  There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.  [CHUCKLES.]  I need to go talk to my captain.  Go ahead, talk to him.  SOLDIER 1: Where's he going?      [CLEARS THROAT.]    We speak the common tongue.  Ah. Good.  I want to be alone with the prisoner.  Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.  UNSULLIED: We have orders to guard the prisoner.  Ordered by whom? The queen herself?  - No. - TYRION: Well, in that case,  as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order.  Probably by quite a lot.  How did they find you?  Did you consider taking it off?  Cersei once called me \"the stupidest Lannister.\"  And you're going back to her, to die with her.  You've underestimated her before.  She's going to die.  Unless you can convince her  to change her course of action.  Difficult to do from here.  [EXHALES HEAVILY.]  When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?  Try.  If not for yourself, if not for her,  then for every one of the million people in that city,  innocent or otherwise.  To be honest, I never really cared much for them.  Innocent or otherwise.  You do care for one innocent.  I know you do.  And so does Cersei.  She has a reason now.  The child is the reason she'll never give an inch.  All the worst things she's ever done,  she's done for her children.  It's not impossible that she'll win.  She won't.  Her enemy's forces have been depleted,  as she said they would be.  Two of the three dragons are dead.  - She's evened the odds. - The city will fall tomorrow.  She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company--  I defended the city last time it was attacked.  I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.  Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.  Why?  Escape.  The two of you, together.  Remember where we met,  where they keep the dragon skulls,  beneath the Red Keep?  Take her down there.  Keep following the stairways down,  down as far as they'll go.  You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep.  A dinghy will be waiting for you.  Sail out of the bay.  If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos.  Start a new life.  Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life?  Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war--  There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer.  Do it.  If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.  Swear to me.  You have my word.  If it works,  give the order to ring all the bells  in King's Landing and open the gates.  That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.  I'll try.  I never thought I'd get to repay the favor.  Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.  Your queen will execute you for this.  If Daenerys can make it to the throne  without wading through a river of blood,  maybe she'll show mercy  to the person who made that possible.

He tells her to \"try again at supper\". Varys implores Jon to take the Iron Throne, but Jon refuses to betray Daenerys. Tyrion Lannister informs Daenerys of Varys' plot; she executes Varys. When Daenerys says she does not have the people's love in Westeros, Jon assures Daenerys he loves her. However, when he stops her kiss, Daenerys resigns herself to fear. Tyrion implores Daenerys to spare the common folk in King's Landing if the city bells ring, and she nods toward Grey Worm. She informs Tyrion that Jaime Lannister has been captured on his way to King's Landing and warns Tyrion not to fail her again.  At King's Landing Tyrion arrives at the Unsullied camp and frees Jaime so Jaime can take Cersei Lannister away from King's Landing to Pentos. Jaime makes for the Red Keep.  The next day, Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane enter the Red Keep. The battle begins with Daenerys and Drogon burning Euron Greyjoy's Iron Fleet, the Golden Company, and the city's defenses. Grey Worm kills Harry Strickland. When Daenerys' army storms King's Landing, the remaining Lannister forces drop their weapons and the city surrenders. Daenerys refuses to accept the surrender and, atop Drogon, lays waste to the city, while her army, led by Grey Worm, massacre the unarmed Lannister soldiers. Jon unsuccessfully tries to stop his men from attacking, kills one who attempts rape, and eventually, he and Davos Seaworth have the rest fall back as the city burns.  Jaime fights Euron, who badly wounds him, but Jamie is able to mortally wound Euron, leaving him to die. Sandor convinces Arya to give up her desire for revenge against Cersei and he and Arya part ways as friends. As Cersei and Qyburn attempt to escape, Sandor arrives and kills the Queensguard in order to fight his brother, Gregor Clegane. Gregor kills Qyburn and Cersei flees. Gregor resists all attacks but when Sandor tackles him through a wall, the brothers fall to their deaths in the fire below. Jaime reunites with Cersei, but find their escape passage is blocked by rubble from the attack. They resign themselves to their fate and embrace as the Keep's cellar ceiling collapses on them, killing them and their unborn child.  Arya experiences the chaos in King's Landing and tries to help the smallfolk she encounters but is knocked unconscious when a bell tower falls near her. When she wakes up, she discovers the burned corpses of the smallfolk on the street. She encounters a white horse coated in blood and rides it away."], "review": ["Well, it was thoroughly uninteresting.You know with all the hype created around this episode, for it to be better than The Great War, you\u2019d expect atleast some sort of redemption from the producers.Let\u2019s break it down:Varys betrays Dany and she burns him alive - and Jon and Tyrion witness it first hand and still go into battle. And when she goes all Mad Queen they\u2019re still surprised?I still can\u2019t believe the steep character shift they brought about for Dany either. She decides to kill everyone and rule using fear just because Jon didn\u2019t make love to her, come on!The Euron and Jamie fight scene - it was absolutely unnecessary and an absolute waste of screen time. Actually, a lot of shots in this episode were a huge waste of screen time. Arya is running about witnessing the war, gets up on a horse and rides into the dust - I guess green eyes is Dany which doesn\u2019t even make sense cause Dany\u2019s supposed to have Violet eyes.The hound and the mountains fight was the only watch-worthy scene that came out of this episode.And God, please don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s how Jamie and Cersei die, that would just be pathetic.Amidst all of this, Tyrion has walked into the city and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.So all in all, the review scale for GOT this season has been dipping by the episode and I have no hopes that the final episode will be any better.", "Not much in the way of depth commentary this time around. Just a few more thoughts on one major arc (spoilers), then quick takes and Reddit highlights.#1: \u201cAnd the end of that way is death.\u201dThere are many ways in which Game of Thrones (and perhaps ASOIAF itself) isn\u2019t a classic greek tragedy. But there\u2019s one rather conspicuous way in which it is, which I think the showrunners deserve some credit for committing to.If we were paying attention, Dany\u2019s heel-turn, though overly sudden, wasn\u2019t quite a turn. Her fate was mechanical \u2014 the necessary outcome of her fatal flaw meeting an environment sure to exploit it. She was deformed long ago by a game almost perfectly suited to exacerbating her central drive (which had been reinforced by her trauma into something like Valyrian Steel). The only question we\u2019ve been left with was whether someone could help her see it before she crossed her final Rubicon.Well, it\u2019s been increasingly obvious this season that help was not on the way, and that, as I went into last week, her dim view of wheel-breaking was the noose that would eventually hang her. Others have added similar commentary in recent days, two instances of which I think are worth reading:This Reddit thread tracks her major decisions from S01 onward, demonstrating how the seeds for this were planted long ago.This Twitter thread is gold (though I\u2019d quibble with its use of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d). While I highly recommend all of it (not super long), I\u2019ll include a few of the money quotes here:  That said, my being in favor of Dany\u2019s arc isn\u2019t quite the same as being in favor of how D&D handled it. While I agree with Twitter Carl that Dany may end up as GRR Martin\u2019s greatest achievement, I\u2019d argue that S08 fell not a little short in meeting that potential vis-\u00e0-vis her on-screen presentation.Briefly, I think everything up until the bells was consistent with her character, Varys included. But the bells themselves? Waaaaay too far, waaaay too fast. In her own words from last week: \u201clet the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed.\u201d For her to pivot from this to burning the Red Keep and a few Lannister soldiers with a handful of civilian casualties along the way? I suppose we could get there. But burning residential blocks and civilians en masse? Just feels like an example par excellence of the lazy sort of writing that\u2019s undercut this entire season.What gets me most is that even with the compressed timeline, lots of these same beats could have been hit in better ways with just minor adjustments. Take Rhaegal\u2019s downfall. Why not make it about Dany\u2019s impulsivity vs. \u201cwell, she forgot about the enemy she\u2019d just discussed with her advisors twelve seconds ago\u201d. As an alternative: she dives towards the ships to burn them in the moment, Euron waits until she\u2019s committed to have his men pull sailcloth off the ballistas, they fire, Rhaegal goes down, Dany barely escapes. Same outcome, and all you lose is a fractional amount of surprise in exchange for greater character logic and overall realism.In the case of her Mad Queen reveal, I thought one of this week\u2019s Reddit leaks (I couldn\u2019t help myself) that turned out to be untrue was actually far cleverer writing. The theory was that Cersei would simultaneously ring the bells while blowing up small caches of wildfire near the walls, thus making those on the ground believe that Dany/Drogon were responsible. Would have been a chess move totally consistent with Cersei\u2019s evil, and would have given Dany some kind of logical pretext for going off the handle (i.e., \u201cif innocents are going to die and I\u2019m going to be blamed anyway, I\u2019m going to burn this city to the ground so Cersei doesn\u2019t win\u201d).Anyway, I hope D&D\u2019s mishandling doesn\u2019t undermine her arc (though I fear it might), as it really is a great bit of writing. If we didn\u2019t see it coming, it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t want to. While her worst instincts were occasionally tempered by those around her, she hasn\u2019t really learned anything. Her first instincts are still fire, blood, and destiny \u2014 which speak to the ancient moral about \u201cthere is a way that seems right unto a man, and that end of that way is death\u201d. Her only salvation would have been someone recognizing and tending to her traumas \u2014 but she never allowed that, and the game itself wasn\u2019t designed to promote intervention and contemplation anyway. Her downfall thus sets up the installation of a new form of government able to eliminate the creation of more Danys, which the current game produces with the regularity and physics of a pendulum swing.(To give the show some credit, saving Dany as the final baddie feels apropos. The real enemy is forever the common impulse within all of us that\u2019s one or two really bad days away from being used as pretext/justification, along with the broken social systems that make recovering from those bad days so difficult. The \u201cdark ages\u201d weren\u2019t one era of the past; they\u2019re the recurring result of us neglecting all the great lessons of history. Unexamined ideas and abandoned insights are the loss of that which separates us from the apes. Ruling is more long division than poetry, and we either confront our hatred of maths or we don\u2019t, and so on.)Anyway, enough sermonizing.#2: In Other NewsGreat title: \u201cThe Last War\u201d. Clear callback to how people called WWI \u201cthe war to end all wars\u201d, which was similarly misguided. (EDIT: Apparently the correct title is \u201cThe Bells\u201d, which honestly feels pretty silly.)Using Arya as ground-level POV was brilliant. And maybe her experience will be enough to make her reconsider Gendry\u2019s offer?Um, did Davos actually help smuggle Jaime somewhere? And, if so, what\u2019s his motivation for treason? It\u2019s not like Davos has some special love for the Lannisters. If Tyrion somehow convinced him, that scene would be important. And does this mean that Davos is on trial alongside Tyrion next week too?When your goal is sneaking into Enemy HQ, maybe you should use your \u201cI can wear other people\u2019s faces\u201d trick? Especially if you\u2019re going to walk alongside one of the most recognizable people in Westeros.Technically, Arya has been saying she would kill \u201cthe queen\u201d, not necessarily Cersei. Obvious setup for her going after Dany. That said, I think Jon having to do it fits the narrative better, which means her thing is (hopefully) just a red herring. (Like a million people on Reddit brought up the whole \u201cbehold a pale horse, and upon him sat death\u201d thing. We get it. But see previous objection.)Dany wasn\u2019t totally wrong about Jon being an idiot. He\u2019s basically Ned: charmingly (and frustratingly) committed to some old school form of nobility, and otherwise generally myopic.I suppose criticizing the show on the level of military strategy is beating a dead dragon at this point, but, like, the point of having walls is usually to have your fighters on the other side. (Also, were those ballistas on the walls only for Drogon? Seems they could have mowed down a lot of Unsullied and Dothraki while the Golden Company were just kinda waiting for Godot or whatever.)On a related note: the Golden Company weren\u2019t, uh, all that good at fighting. Like, did they score a single kill? Not that they had a real chance of winning \u2014 but they went down pretttty easily.I thought the Battle of Winterfell II left like eight Dothraki and maybe a dozen Unsullied alive, all of whom were dealing with pretty severe injuries and general war fatigue. Yet they all teleported to King\u2019s Landing and increased in number like 500x along the way?That Aaron Rodgers cameo (blink and you missed it) was so on the nose it hurt \u2014 never getting a chance to impact the game because his defense was so overmatched. I\u2019ve seen that movie before. [EDIT: Apparently he was actually a random peasant, not a Golden Company soldier. Ah well. The joke stays.]One more thing about Dany\u2019s arc \u2014 it\u2019s the dark side of that \u201cthose who have a why can bear any how\u201d bit. Sometimes your why is perverse, but it helps you survive anyway.Hard to understand why they wasted the film necessary to record Qyburn\u2019s line about it maybe not being totally safe to remain in an open window right by where a dragon was 9/11-ing all the nearby buildings.In like manner, Cersei had this curious lack of urgency in all her movements. Like, sure, shock and hubris and whatnot. But she\u2019s a survivalist, and she knew the basement was her only chance. Why waltz her way down there? (Though, as one commentor styled it, her \u201cTheresa May-ing\u201d past Sandor was good fun, if also tonally weird.)Cleganebowl was ok. Though I guess less impactful when you know The Mountain can\u2019t be allowed to win outright. Kept the whole Oberyn 2.0 gag from being a real scare. Even so, good ending I suppose. Solid unmasked Darth Vader makeup too.Euron giving Jaime the (kinda) mortal blow? Sure, why not. But letting Jaime come back from certain death to get there? Whhhhhhhy?About Jaime \u2014 so Dany\u2019s troops don\u2019t stop him from entering Winterfell, but do somehow catch him on the road leaving it? Wouldn\u2019t he have just lied about where he was going?Ramin\u2019s music for this (and Westworld) is all-time brilliant. Just so good. Especially the end credits.Why did Tyrion turn in Varys when he was about to commit a treason of his own? (Like, I get that his treason wasn\u2019t planned out at that point \u2014 but the fact that he responded to two similar circumstances so differently, one immediately after the other, just isn\u2019t credible.)I guess I owe $50 for Jaime not saying \u201cthe things I do for love\u201d, despite it being the perfect moment when he met Cersei in the keep. Someone name a fitting charity and I\u2019ll donate. Anyway, great ending for him. Remember the scene with Edmure Tully? This is who he is, in all his ugly complications. (That said, his \u201cI don\u2019t care about the innocents\u201d line was especially dumb, as both his kingslayer moment and his initial abandonment of Cersei were predicated on protecting innocent lives. But that\u2019s S08 writing, I guess.)#3: Reddit Has Some Notes(This honestly feels like a super legit point. Reckon there must be what \u2014 like 5,000 little girls out there named after Daenerys? Whoops.)(Also, this was one of like 374 posts to make this comment. I arbitrarily picked this one because I liked the use of the meme. But I\u2019m not crediting the user, as they clearly took the core joke from someone else.)Reference clip for above:(The incel line is pretty harsh. But D&D kinda did open the door for it by using Jon\u2019s not-totally-rejection as major impetus.)EDIT: Ok, a few more that were too good to not include.(Like, his plan \u2014 treasonous as it was \u2014 did actually work. But he got two things wrong: he over-estimated both queens, which is pretty par for the course at this point.)EDIT #2: Ok, a few more again, just for therapy.(I include this because I think it is what the showrunners meant to communicate. But it was done too subtly, I think. More concerning though: I\u2019m not sure what the storytelling point is of Dany being even worse than Aerys? Her story is a tragedy. Any amount of monstrosity would do the trick. This still feels overkill.)(This is the silliest explanation I can conceive of for how they handled her turn. Honestly makes me a little embarrassed for them.)(No deeper meaning with this last one. Just made me feel happy, like the episode didn\u2019t.)", "As usual this is part review, part recap, and I wrote it on the fly while watching so not every observation pans out:First thought, from the other side: I hate being right all the time.Jon is a fucking idiot.Tyrion is a fucking idiot.Can we call Dany a Mad Queen now?

If you want to delude yourself into thinking GRRM doesn\u2019t have something pretty much like this in mind for the books too, and that D&D 100% pulled this out of your asses, that\u2019s your damage.

What are we rooting for here?Varys is writing messages and it\u2019s clear what they say. None of them are in evidence later when he\u2019s caught. Had he been sending them out the whole time? Dead man\u2019s switch?Here\u2019s the Jon-Varys beach scene. It threw me off guard to see Jon arriving at Dragonstone but I guess he had veered off from Davos and the troops to come there. On the one hand it\u2019s believable that Varys would put out feelers for Jon. On the other, it\u2019s insane that he\u2019d do so so openly, with Tyrion literally watching them, and I\u2019m amazed Varys didn\u2019t already know Jon was an idiot.I\u2019m honestly surprised that Tyrion narced on Varys. I thought he\u2019d sit on it and see how things went. The fact that he told on Varys so soon makes me think Varys was right; if he was wrong he could have had some comeuppance later. As it is he looks like a martyr. (What happened to all those scrolls?)Dany looks like hell, understandably. She\u2019s quite like her father here. Everyone\u2019s turned against her, everyone\u2019s a betrayer. Tyrion thinks that narcing early might save him and it \u2026 might not? Maybe?Did \u2026 Jon not know Dany would kill Varys with Drogon? He seems taken aback by what happened but also doesn\u2019t seem too fussed, as I\u2019d\u2019ve guessed he wouldn\u2019t be if it were \u201cjust\u201d Varys.Here\u2019s Dany pretty much openly threatening Sansa again, this time for telling the truth about Jon. It looks even more unhinged than her panicking about it at Winterfell. Funnily Jon seems neither angry nor surprised at his sister. Did he want her to tell? Did he know all along that she would? The thing is that, as I pointed out elsewhere, Dany freaking out about Sansa telling and getting all threatening about it just proves that Sansa\u2019s instinct to tell was right. Dany would not stop feeling edgy even if the secret never got out \u2014 she\u2019d always be waiting for the other shoe to drop, and eventually she\u2019d decide that Jon was better off dead. Sansa forced it out in the open rather than give Dany the chance to knock Jon off like a rat in the shadows.Dany whines that no one loves her here and Jon says he does, and why? At this point, why? What\u2019s he getting out of this? He\u2019s just seen her burn a guy alive and she\u2019s hinting pretty damn strongly that she\u2019d like to do the same thing to his sister. What\u2019s it gonna take? I can sort of see Jon loving the mysterious girl who came to his rescue on a dragon and blah blah, but this? He rejects her sexually, again, so what the fuck is his play here?\u201cLet it be fear.\u201d Yet another Rubicon crossing.Interesting that Tyrion and Grey Worm are counseling her in the throne room but not Jon. She has little consideration for the people in the city now and thinks that the \u201creal\u201d mercy is preventing future people from living under a tyrant, i.e. Cersei. Sure.The Targaryen lines caught Jaime and now Tyrion looks scared shitless. Looks a bit different when someone you actually love is on the line, huh. Dany says if Tyrion steps out of line again she\u2019ll kill him, and he looks like every pathetic scab who ever ratted out people above him before finally following them to the block. Hope it was all worth it.Tyrion and Jon join up with Davos. I see Vale shields.It took a really long time but someone finally remembered that Davos is a smuggler.Arya and Sandor ride up and Arya declares that she\u2019s here to kill Cersei. She\u2019s \u2026 probably not gonna kill Cersei.Tyrion bullshits his way to getting access to Jaime. \u201cDid you consider taking it off?\u201d Fair question.This is pretty much Tyrion signing his own death warrant. Tyrion appeals to Jaime\u2019s child to try to get him to talk sense into Cersei. Tyrion is literally telling Jaime how to commit fuckin\u2019 treason with Cersei. This isn\u2019t even \u201cfeed to my dragon\u201d territory. This is \u201cflaying alive\u201d territory. Bit cheeky for Tyrion to rat out Varys and then do this, isn\u2019t it?This plan won\u2019t work will it? As soon as you plan, shit happens.\u201cYour queen will execute you for this.\u201d No \u201cshe\u2019s your queen too\u201d retort. Tyrion thinks Dany will be happy just to take the city easily. He\u2019s \u2026 also an idiot? Why is every man around Dany an idiot?As other people guessed, Tyrion\u2019s love for Jaime eventually outweighed his loyalty to Dany.Here come the scorpions.Arya and Sandor have made it into the city. Does anyone know they\u2019re there? Jon?Here\u2019s the shot from the trailer with the hooded man and the Golden Company. People guessed from the trailer that the hooded man was Jaime but guessed too that he was their prisoner and that they\u2019d be taking him to Cersei. Nope!What is the time scale here? Jaime and Arya can\u2019t both kill Cersei. I doubt this is being set up so one of them kills her and then nothing happens. How are we filling the next 50 minutes?I want it on the record that Dany\u2019s foot soldiers have literally just arrived at King\u2019s Landing and they\u2019re already getting thrown at the 100% fresh Golden Company. Good idea!Jon, Davos, Tyrion and Grey Worm are standing behind. Tyrion tells Jon to call everyone off if the bells ring. Jon\u2019s back in his Stark armor. Meaningful?Cersei doesn\u2019t look very panicked. Civilians keep pouring into the Red Keep. Everyone\u2019s trying to get in and \u2026 why\u2019d they close the gate?Ah, so Arya and Sandor got in but not Jaime. So much for Tyrion\u2019s plan.So, uh, if Arya kills Cersei. No one knows to ring any bells, right? That was just between Jaime and Tyrion? Uh?Euron and his ships. I\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019m ready for this fucker to go.Euron\u2019s ships are toast but it looks like he may have made it off in time? Going by the show\u2019s standards.It looks like Dany used Aegon I\u2019s Harrenhal maneuver: get really damn high and then plummet down.Dany finally remembered how her dragon works. Cool.The Golden Company and Dany\u2019 forces are standing outside measuring each other\u2019s dicks.Dany blows the gate open, and here we go.Bye, Harry Strickland. We hardly knew ye.LOL Dothraki plowing through King\u2019s Landing while Dany lights it on fire. \u201cLet it be fear\u201d indeed.It looks like for now that Dany\u2019s focusing on the Lannister and GC soldiers. It\u2019s really interesting seeing the destruction close up, and it looks huge, but then you see it from Cersei\u2019s perspective and think, \u201cWow, this really is a massive-ass city.\u201dTyrion yet again wandering through one of Dany\u2019s hellscape wastelands and looking like he\u2019s not sure how he got here. I have an idea.Now it\u2019s Cersei\u2019s turn to get backed into a corner. I think the Red Keep might fall today?Some real Jets/Sharks action going on here with Dany\u2019s men and Cersei\u2019s. I half-expected a dance-off.What the hell is Davos doing here? Isn\u2019t he not that much of a fighter? Is it just that much of a rout that he thinks he\u2019s safe?Jaime\u2019s still trying to get in.I have a bad feeling about Arya and Sandor both already being in.The Lannister forces see Drogon and decide they\u2019ve had enough. Jon\u2019s relieved. Imagine if he had to make a morally questionable decision.Here come the bells. Or the demands for the bells at least.Is Cersei being spiteful as shit here or does she have something up her sleeve?This was all too easy, wasn\u2019t it? Drogon showed up, burned through everything, the GC was a big fat nothing, Dany burned some non-civilian targets and now the bells are going off.What\u2019s the catch.What\u2019s the catch?!Here\u2019s the catch?Dany\u2019s flying to the Red Keep. It looks like Bran\u2019s vision from earlier!Here\u2019s the Mad Queen moment. Dany had the city, the bells were going off, it\u2019s not going fast enough to her liking (I guess?!) and she flies onward and keeps burning stuff. This is like shooting a guy who\u2019s lifted a white flag. I want it to be CLEAR what this is.Hi, these are civilians who are being burned alive. The bells have already gone off.Tyrion is shocked, shocked I say. The fuck did he think would happen?The Lannister forces have dropped their weapons. Grey Worm kills one and it\u2019s open season on them after that.Jon, like Tyrion, looks shocked. Jon, like Tyrion, is a fucking idiot.Well, this is a slaughter. The Lannisters had already put their swords down.Grey Worm sees Jon telling his men to stay back.I get that Grey Worm is emotionally compromised here. But goddamn it.Dany\u2019s still burning shit. She\u2019s doing exactly what Cersei wanted her to do. Congratu-fuckin\u2019-lations, you goddamn fucking idiot.Here\u2019s Davos and Jon trying to control the situation, Davos is trying to get people out of the way.Isn\u2019t this what wasn\u2019t supposed to happen if Dany used the Unsullied?Hi, Dany is fucking burning civilians here. After the bells have gone off. Are we all clear on this? Because I want to be 100% fuckin\u2019 clear on this: DANY IS BURNING CIVILIANS. (Anyone wanna litigate Sansa telling Tyrion about Jon again? No?)You still love her now Jon, you fucking idiot?Jon kills anyone coming at him but otherwise just stands there slack-jawed and watching shit go on around him.Jaime\u2019s still wandering around and he finds the dinghy that was left. There\u2019s Euron. This is gonna be stupid isn\u2019t it?There goes the Red Keep. Amazing that Dany saw all this in the House of the Undying and it was her all along. *chef\u2019s kiss*\u201cThe Red Keep is the safest place in the city,\u201d as the Red Keep gets dismantled.Do Qyburn and Cersei have any other plans?There\u2019s the wildfire! You knew they had it around somewhere.Jaime, kill the fucker. Come on. This is not the time to dick around.Arya and Sandor are in the Red Keep. They might want to get out? I love Arya but she\u2019s not thinking clearly here. Sandor is trying to talk sense into her.So Jon has no idea Arya is here does he.\u201cSandor?\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Oh man. The feels.There are all those holes in the ceiling that Dany saw in Qarth. Groovy!Clegane Bowl time.Bye, Qyburn.Gregor finally sees something he gives more of a shit about than Cersei.I feel like both Gregor and Sandor are going to die here. Be funny if they just had a big blast of fire take them both out.Here\u2019s Jaime and Cersei together again. Valonqar time?This is weirdly touching. The castle is literally falling down around them but they still have that connection. It\u2019s nuts.How do you kill an UnGregor?Arya\u2019s leaving. This is chaotic and crazy. Terrific camerawork here following Arya through the city and seeing everyone dead, injured and terrified.What the fuck does Dany even think she\u2019s doing here? Is she just going after Cersei? Is she just angry? The bells have already rung, for shit\u2019s sake. What is she achieving here? Terrifying people? She apparently meant what she said by \u201clet it be fear.\u201dJuxtaposing Arya against Sandor is really cool, editing- and composition-wise.\u201cFucking die!\u201d Sandor saying what we all think.OH GOD HE\u2019S DOING THE OBERYN THING.Off they go, flying into an inferno. Godspeed, Sandor.Here\u2019s dipshit Jon again. Fire\u2019s going off and so is wildfire. It\u2019s unclear if they left caches of it around just for this, or if Dany\u2019s catching all the leftover shit from her dad\u2019s reign. Either way, this makes everything worse.Does Dany not think to stop when she sees wildfire going off? Does she not think that she has her own men in the city, including Jon and Davos and Tyrion?Jon looks a bit sick. Still love her, Jon?Jon\u2019s finally had enough. Wonder if he thinks he should have taken Varys up on the offer when it was open.Arya, covered in blood and dust. She\u2019s alive but \u2026 temporarily? Eep?Are they \u2026 are they going to Primrose Everdeen Arya?There goes the bell tower. Well no one was using it I guess?Arya\u2019s trying to get refugees moving. They all get ridden down by Dothraki. Arya just led this poor woman to her death.Jaime and Cersei are down in the basement, trying to get out. While it is true that Cersei brought the bulk of this on the city herself, it\u2019s also true that the fucking bells rang and Dany kept lighting shit up anyway.Cersei ends up cutting a rather pathetic, frightened figure. Cue tragic \u201cRains of Castamere.\u201dThat\u2019s the end for them both, but no choking involved. Are we \u2026 are we calling this the valonqar?Every time I think they\u2019re going for the \u201caftermath,\u201d shit keeps getting fired up.How in the shit is Arya still alive?Well Arya, the bad news is that you can\u2019t kill Cersei anymore. The good news is that there may be a replacement?This shot of Arya and the horse is beautiful. Is this death? It looks like death. I really can\u2019t tell if this is Arya actually dying or if she really did find the one horse left alive in King\u2019s Landing. I guess it\u2019s the latter?Final thoughts: Dany went further here than I ever thought. Straight up. My take was that she\u2019d obliviously blow the Red Keep, not knowing there were people inside. Or that Cersei would trick her into lighting up wildfire and blame her for it. Or that Cersei would hold out for so long that Dany\u2019s hand would be forced. Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that she\u2019d get the city to surrender \u2014 ring the bells \u2014 and then blow it all to shit anyway. Tyrion and Jon are both pretty much beneath my contempt at this point. Varys was right. Sansa was right to get the truth out about Jon; if Dany did this, she would have eventually lost it with regard to Jon\u2019s parentage. The Lannister twins\u2019 demise was much more bittersweet than I\u2019d\u2019ve thought \u2014 I feel like a lot of people expected him to kill her in anger but I like the way they did it here. I\u2019m processing still how I feel about that.Cersei\u2019s gone and Dany\u2019s path to the throne is open. But she\u2019s destroyed the city and not a single person in it will ever forgive her for it or see her as anything less than a pscyhotic lunatic. \u201cI\u2019m saving you from future tyranny!\u201d shrieked the lady on a dragon burning people alive. I mean, Jesus Christ.I cannot wait for the \u201cWell Dany burned up King\u2019s Landing and killed probably thousands of civilians, but Sansa told Tyrion about Jon!\u201d takes. Bring them on, please. I could use a laugh after that. Are we going to see Varys\u2019 dead man\u2019s switch? Will Jon and Tyrion \u2014 who\u2019s now lost Jaime when he might otherwise have gotten Cersei out if Dany had just waited \u2014 finally grow some fucking balls? Will Jon find out Arya came really fucking close to dying?So I guess the being prediction next episode is who gets to put Dany out of her psychotic misery. Did they save Arya for that? Will Jon and Tyrion take responsibility for what they did?", "Ashes to AshesKing\u2019s Landing is dead, long live King\u2019s Landing. Dany unleashing her inner Targaryen and turning the once resplendent capital of the Seven Kingdoms into the world\u2019s largest KFC order was harrowing and horrifying yet entirely in tune with her character. She always has been a dormant volcano kept in check by those near and dear to her, and now that she has neither, well, Vesuvius ain\u2019t got shit on her.Yes, it was rushed and ill-executed, but the seeds were there. If only they had taken more time and allowed the turn to feel more organic.She is now officially the big bad of Game of Thrones; she is the endgame, and I hope she gets what\u2019s coming for her \u2013 Arya Stark, the newly reborn Lady of Winterfell.The Fast and the FuriousThe frequently cited issue of the show feeling rushed in its last two seasons has reached critical mass now. Jaime altogether abandoning over five seasons of character development and Brienne going from stoic badass to a \u2018mewling quim\u2019 in the previous episodes were egregious examples of rushed pacing. Make no mistake, both those outcomes are entirely natural, yet they undoubtedly felt abrupt.In this episode, while Dany\u2019s descent into darkness is understandable, giving it more time would have led to a more potent turn.I almost forgot Jon and her are supposed to be in love. When he said \u201cI love you,\u201d it suddenly hit me \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s still a thing.\u201d We are shown that Jon eventually spurning her advances serves as the trigger because until then she feels at least she has Jon, but when he rejects her, that\u2019s when the \u201cLet it be fear then\u201d side of her genuinely comes out.This didn\u2019t work. Partly because Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington have no chemistry whatsoever and partly because we haven\u2019t seen them in love. Jon snowed her in the season 7 finale, and after that, they\u2019ve just had that solitary dragon riding scene.Arise Arya Stark, Lady of WinterfellA girl has a name, and now, a girl has an identity. We saw in this episode, after what feels like ages, Arya\u2019s \u2018human\u2019 side. Her heroism and her desire to save the people above all costs.When she bid farewell to Sandor, she bid farewell to her life as an assassin as well. But there is the matter of that one last kill. She\u2019s going after Dany. But this time, it\u2019s not for personal vendetta, it\u2019s to save the Seven Kingdoms from the tyranny of the now mad Queen.The cinematography, particularly towards the end, was stunning. Props to Maisie Williams, who was completely believable in that climactic scene \u2013 in a state of shock as the world crumbles around her.And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunderOne of the four beasts saying, come and seeAnd I looked, and behold, a white horseThe name that sat on it was death, and hell followed with herThere\u2019s a storm coming Queen Daenerys, first of her name, burner of women and children.And her name is Arya Stark.", "It was extremely fun to watch but I was disappointed at lots of ways.Varys-We all knew he\u2019d die this way, if he ever dies. I\u2019m disappointed at Tyrion\u2019s actions. Varys saved from his trial. I\u2019d expect better from Tyrion.But Varys played the game. He wrote the first later at day, when Jon arrived. He probably sent the first Letter long ago from his execution. We will see a pay-off of it.Tyrion- He realized Varys was right. I loved what he did for Jamie. Makes sense. I also loved his effort to save the innocent. Dany wasted it, sadly.Battle- No Golden Company fight Scene?! Really? Drogon burning Euron\u2019s fleet was good. I liked Jon\u2019s attitude during the Battle, Fall Back!Jamie ve Euron part was good. I liked it.Cleganebowl was the best thing in the whole episode. Great booking. The Desperstion of Sandor was brilliant. Killing his brother by burning him, Poetic Justice. The ending was really good. I was really horrified that the Mountain will to the same thing he did to Oberyn to the Hound too. The Hound\u2019s attitude was amazing. \u201cFucking Die\u201d The Visuals was the best in the whole series. Epic booking.Cersei and Jamie-Did I saw it wrong or did they really died? I am really shocked.The Last words was amazing.Before that, \u201cI dont want to die\u201d part from Cersei was great.\u201cI want our baby to live. Jamie, dont let me die.\u201d\u201cNothing matters but us\u201dReally Moving. I loved it. Can be done better but Brilliant still.Arya Stark will kill Daenerys.Remember that.Seeing the destruction was incredible.The scene of the mother and daughter was well done.Seeing the horror in the eyes of the girl slayed the Night King was amazing.She knows It was Dany\u2019s fault. (I hope showrunners won\u2019t say Daenerys turning to the Villian was the 3rd big plot twist.) She will definietly kill her.

I freed my brother.  And you slaughtered a city.  [IN VALYRIAN.]  [.]  What are you doing here?  Hey, what happened?  I came to kill Cersei.  Your queen got there first.  [SIGHS.]  JON: She's everyone's queen now.  Try telling Sansa.  Wait for me outside the city gates.  - I'll come find you. - Jon.  She knows who you are.  Who you really are.  You'll always be a threat to her.  And I know a killer when I see one.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  Did you bring any wine?  No.  Ah  Well  thank you for coming to see me.  Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long.  I suppose there's a crude kind of justice.  I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn.  Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:  \"See, I told you.\"  It just occurred to me.  I'm talking to the only man alive  who knows where I'm going.  [SIGHS.]  So is there life after death?

When you heard her talking to her soldiers,  did she sound like someone who's done fighting?  She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay.  She liberated the people of King's Landing.  And she'll go on liberating  until the people of the world are free  and she rules them all.  And you've been by her side, counseling her.  Until today.  [SOFTLY.] Until today.  Varys was right.  I was wrong.  It was vanity to think I could guide her.  Our queen's nature is fire and blood.  You think our house words are stamped on our bodies  when we're born and that's who we are?  Then I'd be fire and blood too.  She's not her father,  no more than you're Tywin Lannister.  My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman.  Pile up all the bodies  of all the people they ever killed,  there still won't be half as many  as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.  Cersei left her no choice.  The moment the gates fell,  the battle was over.  She saw her friend beheaded.  She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.  And she burned down a city for it.  Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing  far from the battlefield.  Would you have done it?  What?  You've been up there, on a dragon's back.  You've had that power.  Would you have burned the city down?  - I don't know. - [SCOFFS.]  Yes, you do.  You won't say because you don't want to betray her  but you know.  What's it matter what I'd do?  It matters more than anything.  When she murdered the slavers of Astapor,  I'm sure no one but the slavers complained.  After all, they were evil men.  [SIGHS.]  When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles,  who could argue?  They were evil men.  The Dothraki khals she burned alive?  They would have done worse to her.  Everywhere she goes, evil men die  and we cheer her for it.  And she grows more powerful  and more sure that she is good and right.  She believes her destiny  is to build a better world for everyone.  If you believed that  if you truly believed it,  wouldn't you kill  whoever stood between you and paradise?

No matter the cost,  you've tried to protect people.  Who is the greatest threat to the people now?  It's a terrible thing I'm asking.  It's also the right thing.

I'm sorry it came to this.  [KNOCKS ON DOOR.]  And your sisters?  Do you see them bending the knee?  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.]  My sisters will be loyal to the throne.  Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you?  Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.  - She doesn't get to choose. - No.  But you do.  [KEY RATTLING.]  And you have to choose now.

What do 1000 swords look like  in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20?  I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb.  So many fallen enemies,  you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.  JON: I saw them executing  Lannister prisoners in the street.  They said they were acting on your orders.  - It was necessary. - Necessary?  Have you been down there?  Have you seen?  Children, little children, burned!  I tried to make peace with Cersei.  She used their innocence as a weapon against me.  She thought it would cripple me.  And Tyrion?  He conspired behind my back with my enemies.  How have you treated people who've done the same to you,  even when it broke your heart?  Forgive him.  - I can't. - You can.  You can forgive all of them,  make them see they made a mistake.  Make them understand.  Please, Dany.  We can't hide behind small mercies.  The world we need  won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.  The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.  And it will be.  It's not easy to see something that's never been before.  [.]  A good world.  How do you know?  How do you know it'll be good?  Because I know what is good.  And so do you.  - I don't. - You do.  You do. You've always known.  What about everyone else?  All the other people who think they know what's good.  They don't get to choose.  Be with me.  Build the new world with me.  This is our reason.  It has been from the beginning,  since you were a little boy with a bastard's name  and I was a little girl who couldn't count to 20.  We do it together.  [SOFTLY.] We break the wheel together.  You are my queen.  Now, and always.

They were both to be brought to this gathering.  We will decide what we do with our prisoners.  This is our city now.  If you look outside the walls of your city,  you'll find thousands of Northmen  who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow  is not in your interest.  And you will find thousands of Unsullied  who believe that it is.  Some of you may be quick to forgive.  The Ironborn are not.  I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.  You swore to follow a tyrant.  She freed us from a tyrant.  Cersei is gone because of her,  and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.  Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.  Say another word about killing my brother  and I'll cut your throat.  Friends, please.  We've been cutting each other's throats long enough.  Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?  If it weren't for you and your men,  we would've lost the war with the dead.  This country owes you a debt it can never repay,  but let us try.  There is land in the Reach.  Good land.  The people that used to live there are gone.  Make it your own. Start your own house  with the Unsullied as your bannermen.  We've had enough war.  Thousands of you, thousands of them.  You know how it ends.  We need to find a better way.  We do not need payment.  We need justice.  Jon Snow cannot go free.  It's not for you to decide.  You are not here to speak!  Everyone has heard enough words from you.  You're right.  And no one's any better for it.  But it's not for you to decide.  Jon committed his crime here.  His fate is for our king to decide.  Or our queen.  We don't have a king or queen.  You're the most powerful people in Westeros.  Choose one.  Make your choice, then.  My lords and ladies  [CLEARS THROAT.]  I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives.  What we decide today will reverberate  through the annals of history.  I stand before you  as one of the senior lords in the country.  A veteran of two wars.  And I like to think my experience  has led to some small skill in statecraft  - and underst-- - SANSA: Uncle?  Please sit.  [SCOFFS.]  [CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY.]  [STUMBLES.]  [SIGHS.]  Well, we have to choose someone.  Um, ahem  Why just us?  Um--  We represent all the great houses,  but whomever we choose,  they won't just rule over lords and ladies.  Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone  should be left to  well, everyone.  [ALL LAUGHING.]  Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.  I'll ask my horse.  I suppose you want the crown.  Me?  The Imp?  Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys,  the other half hate me for betraying her.  - Can't think of a worse choice. - Who, then?  I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks.  About our bloody history.  About the mistakes we've made.  What unites people?  Armies?  Gold?  Flags?  Stories.  There's nothing in the world more powerful  than a good story.  Nothing can stop it.  No enemy can defeat it.  And who has a better story  than Bran the Broken?  The boy who fell from a high tower and lived.  He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly.  He crossed beyond the Wall,  a crippled boy,  and became the Three-Eyed Raven.  He is our memory,  the keeper of all our stories.  The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines.  Our triumphs,  mm, our defeats,  our past.  Who better to lead us into the future?  Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.  Good.  Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid,  as you well know.  His will never torment us.  That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.  [.]  From now on, rulers will not be born.  They will be chosen on this spot  by the lords and ladies of Westeros  to serve the realm.  I know you don't want it.  I know you don't care about power.  But I ask you now, if we choose you  will you wear the crown?  Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities  from this day until your last day?  Why do you think I came all this way?  To Brandon of House Stark  I say aye.  [.]  SAMWELL: Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  MAN 1: Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  MAN 2: Aye.  YARA: Aye.  MAN 3: Aye. MAN 4: Aye.  Aye.  I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.  Aye.  I love you, little brother. I always will.  You'll be a good king.  But tens of thousands of Northmen  fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros.  And those who survived have seen too much  and fought too hard ever to kneel again.  The North will remain an independent kingdom,  as it was for thousands of years.  [.]  All hail Bran the Broken,  First of His Name,  King of the Andals and the First Men,  Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.  ALL: All hail Bran the Broken!  [.]  BRAN: Lord Tyrion  you will be my Hand.  N--  No, Your Grace, I don't want it.  BRAN: And I don't want to be king.  I don't deserve it.  I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.  I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't.  Choose Ser Davos.  Choose anyone else.  - I choose you. - You cannot.  Yes, I can.  - I'm king. - This man is a criminal.  - He deserves justice. - He just got it.  He's made many terrible mistakes.  He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.  It is not enough.  TYRION: Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war.  Letting you walk free would start a war.  So our new king has chosen  to send you to the Night's Watch.  There's still a Night's Watch?  The world will always need a home  for bastards and broken men.  [SIGHS.]  You shall take no wife,  hold no lands,  father no children.  The Unsullied wanted your head of course,  but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence.  Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,  but they understand our new king needs to make peace.  No one is very happy.  Which means it's a good compromise,  I suppose.  Was it right?  What I did?  What we did.  It doesn't feel right.  Ask me again in 10 years.  I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.  I wouldn't be so sure.  A few years as Hand of the King  would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.

Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.  We have. These projects will begin as soon as  the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.  The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships,  but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin,  or soon there won't be no more coin.  \"Any more.\"  You Master of Grammar now too?

SAMWELL: Uh the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic  about the salutary effects of brothels.  BRONN: Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.

Tyrion finds the crushed corpses of Cersei and Jaime in the ruins of the Red Keep and mourns them. Grey Worm executes Lannister soldiers, telling Jon that Daenerys ordered it. Daenerys declares to the Unsullied and Dothraki that they \"liberated\" the people of King's Landing, and she will \"liberate\" the entire world. Tyrion publicly resigns as Daenerys\u2019 Hand in protest and is arrested for treason.  Arya tells Jon that because of his Targaryen heritage, Daenerys will kill him as a threat to her rule. Jon visits Tyrion in captivity, who tells Jon that despite Jon's love for Daenerys, it is Jon's duty to kill her for being the people's greatest threat. Tyrion also warns that Arya and her sister Sansa will not bend the knee to Daenerys, putting all of House Stark in danger.  In the throne room, Jon confronts Daenerys, who blames the deaths of civilians on Cersei for using them as human shields. She refuses to forgive Tyrion or the Lannister prisoners, arguing that their executions \u2013 and a continued \"liberation\" campaign \u2013 are necessary to establish her vision of a good world. Unable to dissuade Daenerys, a conflicted Jon reaffirms his fealty to her and fatally stabs her as they kiss. As Jon grieves, Drogon arrives. After discovering that Daenerys has been murdered, Drogon melts the Iron Throne and carries Daenerys's body away to the east.  Some time later, the lords and ladies of the Seven Kingdoms convene to discuss the fates of Tyrion and Jon. Tyrion, still held prisoner by Grey Worm, suggests that future monarchs be chosen by a council, instead of inheriting the crown. This suggestion is agreed upon by the lords and ladies present, and Tyrion nominates Bran to be the new king of Westeros, dubbing him Bran the Broken. Everyone agrees with the nomination except for Sansa, who declares the North's independence from the Seven Kingdoms. Bran accepts, appoints Tyrion as his Hand, and sentences Jon to rejoin the Night's Watch to appease Grey Worm and the Unsullied, who then depart with the Dothraki for Naath, the homeland of his deceased lover Missandei.  Days later, Tyrion convenes a new Small Council consisting of Bronn (now Lord of Highgarden and Master of Coin), Brienne (Lord Commander of the Kingsguard), Davos (Master of Ships), and Sam (Grand Maester). As they begin planning to rebuild King's Landing, Bran, King of the Six Kingdoms, briefly meets with the council and tasks himself with finding Drogon.  Arya sets sail to explore the uncharted seas west of Westeros. Sansa is crowned Queen in the North by the Northern lords. Jon returns to Castle Black and reunites with Tormund, Ghost and the rest of the Wildlings, and leads them to return to the lands beyond the Wall."], "review": ["Drogon flew away to escape from the bad writing.OrDrogon is looking for the writers right now. ( I hope for the latter)Like I don't understand what was the point of Jon's secret Targaryen arc?What was R+L=J for? Why was he \u2018Aegon Targaryen\u2019What was point of him finding out about this parents? What was the point of Sam and the so called \u2018Three-eyed-Raven\u2019 telling him he is *not* a bastard? Like why did Rhaegar run away with Lyanna? Why was he obsessed with the prophecy?What was this -Bran : \u2018 I can't be the lord of anything\u2019Tyrion : \u2018So you wanna be king?\u2019Bran: \u2018Why do you think I am here?\u2019What is the point of a Night's Watch now? It is a fanciful jail for bastards and criminals? Why was Jon exiled there?So since Bran knows all the stories; he should be king?? Like what purpose did he serve as The Three Eyed Raven?If GoT writers wanted to break the wheel, why have a King or Queen at all? Why have a realm of the 6/7 kingdoms? Why does the North deserve special status?Why doesn't the story end with NO Kings or Queen! Just a council or let all kingdoms run themselves?And for crying out loud : FORESHADOWING IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, OMFG.I can't lie, I liked Danny and was hoping for a better ending for her. But her ending did leave a bad taste in the mouth. But I would've even taken a well developed character arc for her turning dark. They try to introduce dialogue between Tyrion and Jon which was more for the audience to understand why Danny deserved to be off.Even if GRRM tells the writers that she goes crazy and decimates KL\u2019s. The problem lies with how the writers got her there. They knew they had to get her from point A - B, but instead of taking a route which made thoughtful and logical sense they took a route which was rushed and lazy. Therefore it gives us an end for her which is cheap and unearned. We get to go on a journey with these characters, we see good turn evil and vice versa. Which is what made the show so beautiful!Endless pursuit of power is dark, and Danny turn to darkness could've worked in the right story writing but this did not work because the progression was completely butchered.GMMR has himself said that he goes and reads discussions on website to see what fans are guessing. And he does admit some people got it right.. BUT despite that he doesn't go about changing storylines or plotlines. Because he laid in clues which lead to something and the new solution won't be satisfactory. So he does not change it. Cause that would be cheating, it would ruin the series.So in conclusion, D&D have given the audience cheap and unearned \u201cplot twists\u201d which for some reason people are happy about (???).DD: \u2018 We hoped to avoid the expected, since Jon has always been the hero of the series, and the savior but it did not seem right to us for this moment\u2019WTFSo setting up Arya as the kiler of NK: CHEAP AND UNEARNED but we wanted to do a plot twist nobody saw coming. So yeah.In another interview GRRM himself quoted : \u2018 Ofcourse you have an emotional reaction. I mean would I prefer they do it exactly the way I did it? Sure. it can also be traumatic. Because their creative vision and yours doesn't match, and you get creative differences - that leads to a lot of conflict.\u2019 \u2018You totally extraneous things like the studio or the network weighing in, and they have some particular thing that has nothing to do with story but relates to - Well this character has very high Q ratings so lets give her/him her a more stuff to do. The series has not been completely faithful.\u2019This is frankly a more acceptable ending :Lastly for all those people who think that anyone who disagrees with the storytelling of the S8 is \u2018entitled\u2019, \u2018whiney\u2019 and \u2018wasn't paying attention\u2019 or \u2018STFU and don't watch it\u2019. Studios makes TONS OF money off your back, our back. These writers have made ton and tons of money, because all of us enable them to. We as fans deserve respect because we are the reason they are where they are. If you liked the season good for you but doesn't give you the right to trash those who don't. It should be criticized, and if it not good enough for some, don't tell the others to shut up and accept it. The online petition to redo S8, which has support from more than a million people itself states they are not expecting an actual redo. I quote the person who started the petition :I don\u2019t think people can reasonably expect HBO to completely remake the season, or any part of this particular series (keep in mind the prequel spinoffs). It costs a fortune to shoot one episode, and I think most signers understand that. Will HBO lose gobs of money over this? Eh probably not. As Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker once said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about sending a message.\u201d And I think this message is one of frustration and disappointment at its core.Is Dany going to succumb to madness in the books? Probably. Is Arya going to kill the Night King? Well he doesn\u2019t exist in the books as of yet so\u2026maybe? Is Jaime going to sacrifice his entire character arc to go embrace Cersei? I\u2019d doubt it, but that\u2019s GRRM\u2019s decision. The issue I have is not necessarily with what we got, it\u2019s HOW we got there -- A rushed, laughably inconsistent mess of a season fraught with cringe-inducing, arc-slaying dialogue and \u201ceverybody is stupid\u201d syndrome. We can expect that the books will describe a more sensical path toward the ultimate conclusions that we will see on Sunday.You don\u2019t need to be a mechanic to know your car is broken.Adding something in to make you smile.Valar Morghulis"]}, "74": {"id": "s08e90", "name": "The Last Watch", "script": "1 [.]  [ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  PHOTOGRAPHER: Jon Snow!

We remember hoping against all hope  that we would get our first table read  for the first season, here we are at the last one,  and it really is  It's like looking around a table  and seeing your family, you know?  - Except that we all get along. - Way better looking.  [ALL LAUGH.]  [ALL APPLAUDING.]  COGMAN: \"Exterior, Winterfell Wall.  \"The battle for Winterfell begins,  heavily adapted, believe it or not, for read through purposes.\"  [ALL LAUGHING.]  \"The Night King turns and sees Jon coming for him.  \"Is this going to be an epic fight?

I saw him riding that thing.\"  [ALL CHUCKLE.]  \"That's right.

When they started on Season 1, it was just one forest,  and 'cause this is the final season,  then yeah, everything seems to be a lot bigger  and heavier and more snow.  It's just, uh, paper. Paper and water,  and it does the job.  [MACHINERY BEEPING.]  You probably need to go into that, uh, hay doober, Steve.  It's just trying to work out where we need to put stuff  and where we don't, you know?  You can go on and reckon we're just seeing that,  but, you know, you move the camera just an inch  and it's another 10 meters that you have to dress.  You can't just throw money at things, you know?  I'm a stickler for that.  I don't like to give away too much money.  I don't like to waste anything. I know it's not mine,  but don't waste it, you know?  FINLAY: What are you gonna do if it snows?  If it snows? Oh, probably have a party.  If it snows, yeah, cover the whole lot in white.  That would be fantastic. But it's just not going to happen.  It just rains in Belfast.  [LAUGHS.]  [MACHINERY BEEPING.]  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: Must be Naomi there.  LISTON: If that's horse feed,  it needs to come up to me at the horse marquee.  MAN: They're fucking lying everywhere.  LISTON: What the fuck are you talking about?  MAN: They've been threw off. They're lying everywhere.  LISTON: They came on a tipper  so we just have to fucking tip them  into the fucking grass.  MAN: Yeah, no worries.  LISTON: So I'm the location manager.  You can have 350 crew,  and with that comes the infrastructure,  service vehicles, extras, marquees.  I sort of end up doing all the logistics  and the running of all the locations  when we're out and about, which is great fun.  [HORN HONKS.]  We'll have to use our imagination a little bit.  - This 25-by-50 meter is extras holding. -   We have to avoid this manhole cover,  so when you bring the crowd up,  the door to the crowd holding will be here.  The only problem is these big gas canisters,  that's all propane. You cannot sit there  having a fag, otherwise the whole thing's gonna go up.      LISTON: That's an electric fence, so they'll not be tempted  to dander up past the electric fence.  MAN:   - Yeah. - [WOMAN LAUGHS.]  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: We've got caltrops in place where they're gonna be,  so we can, um, hide them for the switch.  [CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY.]  We just then They  [IMITATING WHOOSHING.]  [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY.]  I need to go a little bit higher.  I can see the legs and the heads.  But actually want to see them how they jump.  - Just adjust. - And then watch it,  - you can see the - IRLAM: I've said to the guys  the thing that they should focus on is planning  where they're going and making sure they all miss each other.  Let's put caltrops in front of caltrops.  So you create much more of a barrier, yeah?  DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, action!  [ALL SNARLING.]  DIRECTOR: Cut. Good.  - DIRECTOR: Action! - [GRUNTS.]  No!  [SCREAMING.]  DIRECTOR: One. Action!  [SCREAMING.]  SHAPCOTT: It's about choreographing the fights  with Ratsa and Vlad.  It's basically what we do on film set.  [ACTOR SCREAMS, THUDS.]  It's what we do on a film set, we just do it in a tent.  I think they kill him, and kill him  [GRUNTING.]  SHAPCOTT: By the time we come to shoot it,  the producers know what the fight is,  the director knows, the actors know.  Everybody knows what's going on.  [GRUNTING.]  SHAPCOTT: This is one we did yesterday. This is like the end.  [SCREAMING.]  [GRUNTS.]  [CHOIR VOCALIZING.]  [GROANS.]  SHAPCOTT: So each hero moment  we do something like that for.  There's a moment here where you do the two of them meet.  So why don't you Riley?  Take that light back a bit, and we'll take a photograph  of these fine people.  [IMITATES WHOOSHING.]  And hit that, good.  Okay, good. Thank you.  NUTTER: I've been brought in this season  to introduce Episodes 1, 2, and 4  to the throng out there that have been waiting  to see the final season of Game of Thrones.  I'm getting into the consequences  of what happens to people in their lives,  the war that's coming,  and of course how that affects people.  NUTTER:         Okay.  STRAPAZON: Thanks, we'll be in touch. Thanks.  STRAPAZON: He breaks down his scripts, which I help him do.  He gets floor plans printed out that he cuts up  and then blocks out where the characters are gonna go,  where they move to, where the camera's gonna go.  And it's a little road map for the whole scene.  He draws it all by hand,  and he likes it on U.S. letter-size paper,  which is like 8 1/2 by 11, I think.  - FINLAY: Not A4? - No, he doesn't  A4, it doesn't work.  So we shipped over a big box of goldenrod paper.  FINLAY: Why does A4 not work?  [SIGHS.] Don't question the system.  This is my nemesis, this copy machine.  [FINLAY CHUCKLES.]  [SIGHS.]  It's upside down.  STRAPAZON: He is one of the few people  on the show that has printed scripts.  They were trying to go all digital this year,  have everything on iPads,  but that's just not how he rolls.  He claims he's a Luddite, but, you know, he's done  some of the most iconic episodes.  He did the Red Wedding and the Walk of Shame.  FINLAY: What is that a drawing of, on the top there?  NUTTER: That's a dead Theon, and that's Sansa overtop of him.  - FINLAY: On your special paper. - NUTTER: On my special paper.  FINLAY: How long have you used this process?  NUTTER: Since the very beginning.  - FINLAY: Did someone teach you? - I taught myself.  This is my method.  My methodology.  My stuff goes in that safe there,  nothing gets left out.  If you touch the paper at the wrong time  it will dissolve like Mission Impossible  and burn up.  [CHUCKLES.]  [.]  WOMAN: We're doing it tomorrow.  It needs to be up here.    ALEXANDER: It is, well,  just 20 past 4, yeah.  [LAUGHS.]  So yeah, those 4 or 5:00 starts are quite regular.  I think half past 3 has been the earliest,  when we were in Morocco.  [BOTH LAUGH.]  ALEXANDER: Cheers, all right.  - Good morning, darling. - CLARKE: Hi.  - BANKS: How are you? - CLARKE: All right.  ALEXANDER: Emilia's generally got dark hair,  so when you put the wig on, it looks like it's got roots.  CLARKE: This is the sexy bit.  So we have to put a little cap over  that kills any dark.  FINLAY: I don't think anyone knows it's this much work.  No. Also this is very lucky, to see this bit.  This is normally when someone like a producer  knocks on the door and you're like, \"Not now!\"  - Please, don't come in. - [ALL LAUGHING.]  [COUGHS.]  ALEXANDER: Gilly's gone glamorous.  BANKS: Ooh. She has. Looks very nice.  - ALEXANDER: A weekend look. - [ALL CHUCKLE.]  CLARKE:   BANKS:     No, it is, because that is still the most beautiful hair  I will ever have on my head, ever.  [LAUGHS.] It's magical.  When you put that on, it's just an instant whoa.  - BANKS: There she is. - CLARKE: Oh my God, there she is.  My heart is in my throat  when I think about this not happening much longer.  Putting this on. It gets  Genuinely gets me really, like  [GULPS.]  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  RILEY: Look at that. Beautiful. Rhiannon did all of this.  These beautiful illuminated scripts.  And then the magic's over again.  It was beautiful.  CAULFIELD: It's a simple enough scene, no?  Yeah, yeah. It's a great start.  Everybody's like, \"Oh, I'm so happy  this is how we're starting.\" And so it's perfect.  And he's so excited to be here,  which is so sweet too. That he's, like, thanking me.  No, I'm thanking you. No, I'm thanking you.  So yeah.    I know, he's just so excited that he got to do  And to do three, 50 percent of the final season.  He does that I call it the penguin walk,  it's like, \"Oh, the penguin's released.\"  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Good morning. If we could give David  a little privacy for this first rehearsal please? Thank you.  CAULFIELD: Here we go.  - [WHOOPING.] - [CHUCKLES.]  SAMWELL: If it's not too much trouble,  I could use a pardon.  For what crime?  SAMWELL: I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.  STRAPAZON: I love me some Dragon Queen.  I love Daenerys. I love dragons.  I would hope that I would be a Targaryen,  minus the whole are they crazy, are they not crazy,  the incest thing and all that stuff.  But, um, being able to go from,  you know, waiting and watching it on my couch  to then being on the set when they're shooting  the final season, it's been kind of surreal.  FINLAY: Do we need to let you go do your job?  STRAPAZON: It would be good. I'm going to bring him almonds,  which will be very good. Protein, fuel him on set,  make sure he's got everything going.  I'm like his stamina elf.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  - STRAPAZON: Almonds? - NUTTER: Thank you.  STRAPAZON: Do you want any yang herbs?  - Oh, yes, yes. - Okay, yeah, I'll go get it.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: And roll sound, please.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  MAN: Thirty-nine Apple, take one.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Quiet on the set.  NUTTER: First shot of the last season.  - And - [PEOPLE CHUCKLE.]  - CAMERA: Set. - SOUND: Set.  NUTTER: Action.  SAMWELL: Your Grace.  DAENERYS: Your brother stood with your father.  I offered to let him retain his lands and titles  if he bent the knee. He refused.  SAMWELL: Um, thank you, Your Grace, for telling me.  May I?  DAENERYS: Of course.  MAN [ON PA.]: Cut there.  [BELL RINGS.]  McCRUM: Basically it's called the heart attack van.  We just follow them 'round everywhere.  We tried to do healthy stuff,  but they like things that'll keep them going.  The tiger toast thing started just one day  whenever I was feeling a bit peckish myself  when I was in Tesco's doing my shopping.  I thought I'll go buy a tiger loaf and have a wee toastie,  and I made it fully loaded like this for myself.  One of the guys happened to notice it  and went, \"What are you making?\"  \"Making myself a wee toastie.\"  He says, \"Can I have one?\"  Next thing everybody was coming, \"Can I have one?\"  And now it's one of the most popular things here.  Bacon, chicken, cheese, ham, tomato, onion,  tobacco onions, on the big tiger bread.  - McCRUM: Hello. - How are you?  - McCRUM: What's the crack? - Not much.  - Good. Wee toastie? - Yeah.  McCRUM: What sauce would you like on yours?  Thanks very much, see you later.  CUSTOMER: Thank you.  FINLAY: What are you doing today?  Jaime Lannister trousers.  [FINLAY CHUCKLES.]  [.]  [GRUNTING.]  A little bit of infection in your wounds, perhaps.  McCLAY: Oh, yeah.  [CHUCKLES.]  [CHUCKLES.] See you later, Rory.  See you in a bit.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, action.  No way.  It's a flaming Dothraki arakh.  ASBAEK:   DUNNE:     BANKS: Ding dong, look at that.  Is there a camera crew behind us?  No.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Three, two,  one, go.  WOMAN:   Right, come on, you, down here quickly.  [LAUGHS.]  DRIVER: You taught me how to park the sausages.  Park your sausages, park your fucking sausages.  She teaches how to park the sausages.  That's a big fucking gap.  That's a cheap fucking sausage.  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: First of the last?  The first of the last get-ins of Game of Thrones.  Does that not bring a wee tear to your eye?  - MAN: No. - All right, fine, okay.  Fucking bastard.  Not like I haven't fucking stood there wasting my life,  waiting on you fucking getting to your fucking unit base  - [LAUGHING.] - for the past seven years.  I'm going to be crying next year because I'm unemployed.  [BOTH LAUGH.]  [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  Thank you very much.  SARAH: Today we're doing crypt wights.  These wights are mummified.  We're a bit nervous about today  because it's the first time we've done this style of wight.  FINLAY: What are you nervous about?  Uh, that everybody likes them.  [CHUCKLES.]  They're doing a proper lighting test. I don't know.  FINLAY: I do believe so.  SARAH: And David and Dan are coming.  FINLAY: Dave and Dan are here,  so they will, most likely, be popping in, I imagine.  FINLAY: So did you just set up and pitch to Game of Thrones?  - Did they come and offer you? - No.  SARAH: No, what happened was Barrie's always worked  for other prosthetic artists.  - FINLAY: Okay. - SARAH: I'd done visual effects.  Barrie said, \"I think they're interested  in a few people quoting on Game of Thrones.\"  And so Barrie and I were like:  \"Let's see what happens.\" You know, da-da-da.  We did our little spreadsheet, and working everything out.  Then Barrie got the phone call  to say that we'd won it, and we shat ourselves.  We didn't have a workshop. We didn't have crew.  We didn't even have tables. We had nothing.  FINLAY: Okay.  [PHONE RINGING.]  Hey, Leigh.  - LEIGH: Hey. - Hey.  We just had, um, Leigh Maddern over here  to try the stump, for  Leigh, the stuntman, uh, for the severed  For the severed arm.  And do you remember David Nutter said  they'd make sure that the character  would have their sleeves rolled up.  So the issue is  Leigh says the characters are wearing long-sleeved,  thick jackets, which means  that really you can't do a severed arm gag  'cause it'll look stupid.  You know, that's the gag, you're like  [SCREAMING.]  Can you scratch my nose?  SARAH: All we've got to do is try on the jacket  make sure I can pull the sleeve up.  If I can pull the sleeve up, its happy days,  - if I can't, we'll rethink. - Not happy days.  [LAUGHING.] Then have a rethink.  They'll say it's more important to go for the crypt.  If you cut through there and there,  it's never going to go through A sword would never.  It would never.  Oh, that might be all right.  MAN: It seems horribly convenient  he's got his sleeves rolled up  ready to have his arm chopped off.    SARAH: I feel like he could have a few gold chains or something.  If they're all having their pints  Hey!  Aah! Ha-ha-ha.  Thank you for doing that.  Do you know how I get to Cell 4?  MAN: Oh, um  SARAH: Down there?  MAN: Right through there, take a left.  - Yeah. - It's right outside.  SARAH: Okay, thank you.  Don't follow me getting lost.  [SOFTLY.] Shit.  Damn it.  Cell 2.  It's hard when you work so hard on something  and you want everyone to like it,  so I'm hoping they'll be like, \"Yeah, you nailed it!  High-five!\"  [LAUGHS.] Has anyone said anything?  - BARRIE: Nobody's seen anything. - SARAH: Nobody's seen anything.  - BARRIE: No. - SARAH: I'm excited for these.  I really hope everyone's gonna like them.  BARRIE [WHISPERS.]: I think Dave and Dan are about to come.  MAN 1: Yeah, come on ahead, come on ahead.  SARAH: I can't really tell what they think.  I wanted a big round of applause.  I can't really tell what they think.  MAN 2:   SARAH: In terms of the makeup, I think they're happy.  But, um, they're gonna send the pictures to Miguel,  Miguel's gonna make notes, go through them with David and Dan.  We're going to have a meeting tomorrow  to run through all library and crypt, so, you know.  But it wasn't a disaster.  [.]  Today's final. Ha, ha.  Ta-da!    [MACHINERY BEEPING.]  REID: Just little squirts every now and again  for bits that needs to go over.  SAPOCHNIK: The way this battle is gonna work  is this show has been about  that people don't get on.  Now they finally find a way to get on.  You got the North with the wildlings.  So they all come together and then somebody fucks up.  REID: Fucking gloves have shrunk.  You, Jack and Glen go in and see sweet cheeks  and do the dressing in there, ready for the first shot.  REID: I think it's mainly that bit back there.  Yeah, that's the bit I can see.  It's definitely tire tracks and that, car tracks.  I think that'll do it, then, I don't think  they'll see much further than that.  SAPOCHNIK [ON MEGAPHONE.]: All you guys  that made it, you're going to survive to the big battle.  Except the 10 guys in the back are gonna die.  [ALL CHUCKLE.]  SAPOCHNIK: We're going to do a lot of running tonight.  REID: Just a bit of blue roll, please.  [SAPOCHNIK SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY.]  Just a little bit. One sheet, one sheet.  Don't waste it.  SAPOCHNIK: Nine, eight, seven, six,  five, four, three, two, one, action.  MAN: Go have a look at the lasagna, see what it looks like.  If it looks a bit skanky, I'll have the chicken.  Or maybe just have both  and take some home for fucking dinner.    [MACHINERY BEEPING.]  SAPOCHNIK: I think one of the things to take into this  Let's do the whole scene as if you both got stomachache.  - TURNER: Okay. - WILLIAMS: Mm-hm.  TURNER: Okay. Because also,  is this the first time you've seen a wight, as well?  This is the first time  - I'm seeing them. - Yeah.  We've been prepping and prepping  but really we don't know shit.  I think the whole point, though,  of this is it's not about You can't see them.  - It's the suspense of it. - Yeah. I think so.  That's what it is. That's what I'm saying, the stomachache,  it's uncomfortable because you can't see.  You don't have the information.  - Yeah. - SAPOCHNIK: Let's do it again  up to that point.  Then we'll work through the next section.  Set, and action.  And the dragons pass over you.  And off they go.  And they bank left,  they get further and further away.  That light's slowly disappearing.  And now there are none.  But what you can hear  is a very, very low rumble.  [RUMBLING.]  SAPOCHNIK: Episode 3 is a battle from start to finish  and has three dialogue scenes in it, and that's it.  Like, if you took Battle of the Bastards into Hardhome  to the Loot Train, if you put all those three together  that's probably the size of this episode.  I feel tired and cold,  really not particularly in the mood  to go and do a long 11 weeks of night shoots.  I don't really want to spend 55 nights up.  Uh, it's David and Dan's fault, mainly.  Basically.  'Cause they wanted to do something bigger.  FINLAY: Was today a good day?  Yeah, I think so. Probably.  I mean, we finished it on time and didn't fuck it up.  [.]  [MACHINERY BEEPING.]    [FURDIK IMITATES BLOWS LANDING.]  Acting, acting, acting,  and with the last one, you need to be already,  on your position.  One, two, three.  Good.  One hit, hit, drop, pull.  - [IMITATES SWORD RINGING.] - Big smash. Okay, good.  [GRUNTS.]  FURDIK:                     Now I'm in the front line,  so I'm like, \"Wow, what I'm doing here?\"  Why? Why me?  [SONG PLAYING OVER RADIO.]  [SINGING ALONG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE.]  FURDIK: I grow up in Czechoslovakia.  After the revolution, many of my friends  became part of the bad boy.  I was 14, 15, and I had decision.  Go with them to be gangster,  or be with a live show.  So when I decided to stay with the show,  it was good because many of my friends are dead already.  [.]  The mask completely changes you.  You're stepping in the makeup trailer joking,  you know, and happy, and step-by-step,  you're becoming the dark side.  He called me and he asked me  if I would like to be Night King.  And I don't heard Night King, I heard just king.  And I said, \"I can be any king.\"  You know. Don't worry.  I think he's angry.  He don't want to be Night King.  The Children of the Forest, they changed him,  and now he's, \"Okay, you want me to be Night King?  Okay. Now I kill you.\"  My name is Aberdale Strongbeard.  Uh, I have fought for Stannis Baratheon.  I've also fought for, uh, Jon Snow,  and that's where I currently find myself,  as part of Jon Snow's Stark army.  I've been taking out the undead,  you know, thinning them out  before they actually reach Winterfell.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  MAN: I don't want to be on the Night Watch,  I'm in House Stark, thank you very much.  I'm not a thief, I'm not a rapist, okay?  It's just Watch now.  I'm not even a second son of a lord  who wants honor up on the Wall.  I'm a man of House Stark, that's what I am.  I don't want to be a Frey. No way Frey.  I don't want to be a Lannister. I don't want to be a Bolton.  House Stark. Absolutely has to be them.  - FINLAY: Why? - Why?  Um, the direwolfs are just cool,  Eddard Stark, fighting for Eddard, revenge.  Mad about Jon Snow, my favorite character.  The armor's cool. Winterfell's class.  It's just, like, the main family in the story.  I was standing up at Magheramorne Quarry Season 6,  and I had just met Gerald.  And then we're just chatting,  and then the next thing here comes Kit Harington  on a horse and Kit Harington's like, \"Oh, hello, Gerald.\"  Just like that.  And they just start talking like they're friends.  And then Kit goes off on the horse,  and I'm just like  [ALL LAUGH.]  - MAN: Let's move, boys. - All right. We're out of here.  And on six, five, four, three, two, one,  at the end you guys get back up again.  I'm kind of doing the general  I can get them with no arms.  That's fair.

MAN: I want the episode.  - McCLAY: 2019, man. - MAN: I fucking want it.  McCLAY: It'll be the longest we'll have to wait to watch it too.  You know what I mean?  From being here to watching it on-screen.  - MAN: Are you not loving this? - McCLAY: Yeah. It's kick ass.  MAN: We're stood in the middle of Winterfell.  Take it in. Drink it in.

We kill the flame   MAN: Action.  [ALL GRUNTING.]  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  SARAH: The big heavy makeup is quite hard work, the last couple days  some of us have been doing like 18-hour days.  - WOMAN: Is he heavy? - SARAH: It is a heavy wound,  even if it doesn't say heavy wounds.  Yeah, so next round, all heavy wounds.  Did we order you some gloopy blood?  Was this for you?  Was it turned things with dark scabs?  Well, they're nice and cold.  See if you can take them all.  See if we can get all of them.  Amazing.  - [LOTTIE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY.] - [SARAH LAUGHS.]  Just talking to somebody, Lottie.  We've moved to a different location now,  we're somewhere else.  You had to do the homework that they gave you?  - Yeah, that was the same one. - SARAH: Oh.  LOTTIE: Look, this is some of our Easter stuff.  Oh, she's showing things she shouldn't be showing.  - [LAUGHS.] - GRANDMA: They were hidden.  - They were hidden. - GRANDMA: For Easter.  Lottie, you found them.  That wasn't a very good hiding place, Nana. Was it?  LOTTIE: Yeah  Don't do that, Lottie.  All right, then, poppet.  I'll speak to you again tomorrow.  All right, do some good swimming, yeah?  GRANDMA: We'll do some reading now.  You're gonna go do some reading,  and you'll practice your spellings.  All right, then, poppet. I'm gonna go.  I'm gonna go.  - LOTTIE: Bye. - All right, then.  - LOTTIE [GOOFILY.]: Uh Uh - [LAUGHS.]  All right, then, sweet. Love you.  LOTTIE: Uh Bye.  That's it.  Funny little thing.  I think it's unfortunate  that both her parents are here,  so she hasn't even got one of us at home.  This was never the plan, so  I'm just gonna go see where that stunt person is.  [.]    [DOOR OPENS.]  BANKS: Morning.  I have to travel with them in my hand luggage,  like my little pets.  Wallet, your passport, and your wig.  [LAUGHS.]  Today's scene, she's a lot tidier.  'Cause she hasn't been on the dragon yet.  It will be a little bit more  I'll need to be a little bit more on it.  When you've got a long wig, you're busy all day  because it all gets fuzzy,  and I'm constantly like, \"Ah, hair.\"  - WOMAN: Good morning. Hi. - HARINGTON: How are you doing?  I'm just going to do my vocal warm-up I do every morning.  Jon Snow, Jon Snow, Jon J Jon Snow.  - [BANKS LAUGHING.] - Jon Snow.  I left the curtains open  when I was stark bollock the other day.  Yesterday.  I got out of the shower,  and a fucking drone just drove by.  [ALL LAUGHING.]  I was like, there's no privacy anymore, is there?  CLARKE: That's amazing.  HARINGTON: We came here first in our second season,  and since then I've felt very attached  to this place, and it feels like Thrones.  Woodward, hello darling.  I'm good, yes. You okay?  CAULFIELD: When I first came onboard, Chris sent me a picture  of Iceland.  I saw that picture, and I said:  \"Yeah, that's what we need.\"  I pitched it to HBO,  so little was known about how short the days were,  how risky it was, nobody questioned it.  It's such a magical place.  When that sun rises,  it's like somebody slowly unwrapping a present.  Morning.  How are the bones?  MAN: Start walking around.  All right.  [GROANS.]  JON: I don't know how to ride a dragon.  DAENERYS: Nobody does.  Until they ride a dragon.  NUTTER: No, really get in.  Really get in for the nose.  I could do with this amount of snow around me all the time.  - [LAUGHS.] - Seriously.  MAN: Everybody back, please.  Guys, let's clear the eye lines. Goodbye. Thank you.  I'm the only one that's allowed to shout around here.  BANKS: It's not looking quite as tidy as it once did.  I should split.  [SIGHS.] Bloody hair's just moved again.  MAN: Do you have an opinion on the hand warmers?  Cam left, pan out.  MAN: Snow.  HARINGTON: Snow.  Snow. Jon Snow in snow. Ha-ha-ha.  Ready, and, action.  Move to your right little bit, Emilia.  And growl.  One more kiss, a little bit more,  and Emilia go a bit more to your right,  kissing and moving around, and still.  Growl.  One more, ready?  Growl.  I think we got it. Check the plate. Good.  MAN: Moving on.  CAULFIELD: In our hearts, it was important for us  to come here. It wouldn't have felt the same if we didn't.  It just makes my heart really smile.  [.]  [.]  DJ 1: Nine minutes to 7.  The so-called beast from the east  is making its presence felt  in both Britain and Ireland.  DJ 2: Ireland under the highest weather warning,  with the worst snow seen for 35 years.  DJ 1: Four hundred and forty schools will be closed today.  People have been told to stay indoors.  MAN:         I need to get back here by 10.  That's all because we can't open the doors anymore.  - FINLAY: What? - We should  In usual circumstances,  we would just take that straight out.  Um    We're so, so tight now, in terms of time,  that something like, you know, this sort of poor weather  makes this a bigger deal for us than it should.  FINLAY: Is this a harder season than others?  - MAN: By a long shot. - RILEY: By a long way.  The schedule is impossible. And  The season is very big.  It's written very big, um, but we have  It's just all this business of trying to do,  you know, film finishes on a TV schedule,  and on a TV deadline. And, um  And I think this season,  we've certainly found the limit  of what's able to be achieved.  And, um  And insofar as I think, now everybody, um, realizes  that Game of Thrones has to finish  because it just cannot get any bigger.  You know, there are a lot of frayed nerves walking around,  um, myself being one of them.  [.]  LISTON: We're still totally, 100 percent  frozen over at Tomb.  No, I mean, yesterday we had 250 extras,  and all the crew and not one toilet.  In the bowls, the bleach was frozen.  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: That's wild.  Oh, it was the icicles  hanging off the taps that I couldn't believe.  You try and preempt as much as you can,  but sometimes it just gets to a stage where,  you know, you just can't hold mother nature back anymore.  REID: I mean, it's starting to snow again now so,  you know, it's one of them, \"I can't really say  \"that we're gonna do work  until I know we can do some work.\"  Is that a good enough answer for you?  [LAUGHS.] I can't really say anything else,  'cause it's snowing. And if it snows,  well, we can't just dress on top of real snow.  Cheers. Thanks a lot. Bye.  Bye.  It was not a good idea to have been doing it in the winter.  You needed to have spread the snow locations out,  because we can't do that many at one time.  Look at all this nonsense,  it just keeps coming through all the time.  It's like, okay, like I've got time  to keep pulling my phone out of my pocket.  Zigzag road, they made us put up a horizon the night before,  came in in the morning ready to shoot  \"Can you take that down?\"  So that's half a day of mine wasted.  So, what we're doing, we're getting this snow up,  so we can take it up to Magheramorne,  the battlefield. You know, we're just under the cost.  Ah, shit.  The wind's blowing a good one here.  REID: You, Dicky, you up at Magheramorne?  There is no water at all. Nightmare. All right, mate.  Tara, tara.  It's all frozen up at Magheramorne.  Now I have to sort out a pump and pump it out the lake  and, ugh! Fucking hell.  FINLAY: How's it going, Del?  REID: It is all going. I just feel like crying.  This car's got no bollocks.  This Fiesta, stupid little thing.  [IMITATES ENGINE.]  [LAUGHS.]  You know, it's difficult to find people  who know the job, and it's not rocket science.  I mean, you could do it, Jeanie. It ain't hard.  [HONKS.]  Welcome to hell, George. Welcome to hell.    I'm not one for listening to people whinge.  I just think, \"Oh, come on.\"  I was brought up in children's homes.  You know, I didn't have a clue where me mom and dad was.  I left the homes when I was 16-and-a-half.  They give you 300 quid, your bloody birth certificate,  and all right, get yourself out there.  [CHUCKLES.] It's just, \"Hm. Okay, then.\"  So, yeah, that opened my eyes.  As I've progressed, you know, I've always got more money  and I just think, \"To keep that,  I'll have to keep working at the pace I'm working.\"  You just want to do the best for your kids.  You know, I'd give up my house for my kids.  [.]  REID [LAUGHS.]: I've never not done a set yet,  but it's been very close twice.  This is the second time it's been close.  But we'll get there. I think.  [LAUGHS.]  WOMAN 1: Hi. My horses are dyed pink.  WOMAN 2:   WOMAN 1: Don't even go there.  They've tried warm water, Fairy liquid,  - I can't get them back to white. - Look at the state of him.  One of them might be saying, \"I'm pink. I don't like pink.\"  McCLAY: Magheramorne Quarry's been the site  of the Battle of the Blackwater,  Hardhome, it's also Castle Black.  This is the biggest green screen I have ever seen,  but it's really impressive what they've built here.  [HORSE NEIGHS.]  McCLAY: This battle sequence I think we have coming up.  They don't tend to tell us a lot of stuff.  On the day, one of the ADs get up  and actually tells us what's actually happening that day.  - [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.] - The numbers we've just heard  are 120,000 wights  [LAUGHING.] against 18,000  um, combined in Daenerys's army  and Jon Snow's army as well, like.  So we're extremely outnumbered.  I can't even begin to imagine how this is gonna look on TV.  [.]  McCLAY: The way I like to think of it  is that the extras department is like one of the main actors.  Just as important.  I got a close-up at the Battle of the Bastards,  I had no idea the camera was on me.  ASSISTANT: Rolling. Camera set, and three, two, one  [ALL GRUNTING.]  McCLAY: There's this collective thing  we know that we're all in,  trying to make this really exciting.  Because even the background tells a big story.  ASSISTANT: Great stuff, thank you. We have cut.  MAN: March. Left, right, left.  - Darling. - McCRUM: Cheers, thank you.  [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY.]  McCRUM: And a wee egg, sure. Sophie, isn't it?  - Yeah, Sophie, yeah. - Nice to meet you.  - Huh? - Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you too.  McCRUM: Sophie Ellis-Bextor,  I couldn't believe it. I'm totally starstruck.  One of my favorites from years ago.  You never get to see these people any other time, you know?  But, yeah. It's like a wee dream sometimes.  - FINLAY: They're coming to you. - I know. I know.  She said I was well-stocked, and I was like  - [FINLAY LAUGHING.] - McCRUM: Bonus.  Very busy and a bit stressful,  because of the nights.  How many nights have we done so far?  - Fourteen weeks, 15 weeks? - WOMAN: No, we're on our ninth.  - What? - WOMAN: Yeah. Ninth.  - Yeah, it's only Week 9. - It's only Week 9.  Is it really? No, it's more than that.  We started in January.    FINLAY: Is this the longest run of nights on Game of Thrones?  Yes. In fact, we were trying to think  is this the longest time any film has filmed nights?  I guess I could try to Google that.  What's the longest nights of any film crew?  SAPOCHNIK: A smoke nightmare.  That's like smoke apocalypse.  It's almost like a bad dream.  I got to sleep at 9:30 in the morning, and I slept till 1:30.  Three hours? Is that four hours? I don't know.  One of my best-ever anxiety dreams.  It was a beautiful blue sky,  and there was a rope strung across my vision  and it just got pulled taut, taut, taut, taut.  Then it snapped, and I woke up.  [CHUCKLES.]  MAN:   SAPOCHNIK: I don't fucking know.  Sounds like anxiety to me.  Background and stunts,  until the moment we yell cut,  you need to hold your breath, but also not breathe out.  It's gonna be amazing. If anybody dies, let me know.  CAULFIELD: How are you doing? How are you feeling?  - Good time, yeah. - Yeah? Were you a little sore?  A little sore.  Just the muscles ached, yeah.  CAULFIELD: It just gets old, these nights. Yes, sir.  Um, so, this In this, you're dead.  GLEN: Dead.  CAULFIELD: He dies?  GLEN [CHUCKLES.]: The ending makes sense.  - CAULFIELD: Yes. - Everything that's gone before.  Certainly the way they're shooting it.  CAULFIELD: That he'd die for her.  GLEN: And I think that's a big part  - of her demise. - CAULFIELD: Yes.  SAPOCHNIK: Ready, and action.  [SOBBING.]  [.]  SAPOCHNIK: Cut.  ASSISTANT: Good for 8, marker.  CAULFIELD: I can feel the weariness setting in.  Tonight Candy said, \"Oh, only 14 weeks until we wrap.\"  And that made it sound like, \"What? No.\"  I mean, it's a mixed thing.  One way, you're wishing it away,  like, \"Oh, please, let's get through this, this and this.\"  And then the other one is like, \"No,  I don't want this to end.\"  [.]  [MACHINERY BEEPING.]  [WHIRRING.]    HILL: This is a Godswood tree.  Um, I think it's a magical sort of tree.  It goes back, way back in time, and Children of the Forest  They do the Children of the Forest,  and they put a wee face on the front of it there.  Um Phew. But to be honest with you I don't really know.  FINLAY: Have you done the Godswood before?  HILL: I do it every year. It's my seventh year doing it.  FINLAY: Have you got a favorite character?  I did like Stannis before he killed his daughter you know.  And I liked At the minute  I actually like the Night King, you know.  I'd like to have met him.  FINLAY: You know what's going to happen?  Yeah, I do. I do. Ha-ha-ha.  FINLAY:   HILL: Yeah.  [.]  FURDIK: When I read this, if it was up to me,  maybe it would be good when Bran will kill me.  So Arya, she will appear, I will grab her or something,  maybe I will kill Arya, and Bran, he kill me.  - He will throw the knife to me. - WOMAN: Just throw it.  And then this make Night King angry, you know?  I am happy, and then, okay, he looking at me, and then  I see on his eyes and body like, \"Oh, Night King.\"  And then I Mm okay.  Arya will kill me.  The girl kill Night King, how is this possible?  FURDIK: This year I don't feel so very comfortable  because I don't know where I belong.  If I'm part of the actors  - or I'm part of the stuntmen. - ASSISTANT: Action.  FURDIK: Many times the stunts are joking with me:  \"Hey, you're the Night King, you don't need to do nothing.\"  Sometimes I thinking, \"You know, is that true?\"  When we finish Night King stuff,  I can do some fire job  and falling from the stairs or some fight.  I looking forward.  Yeah, I like that. I like that.  ASSISTANT: So cast can step off, thank you.  FINLAY: They called you a bit early, Vlad.  [LAUGHS.] Classic.  - It's the movie business. - Yeah.  - Waiting, waiting - Hurry up and wait, yep.  Hurry up Do something. And then again wait, wait.  - Yep. - Kill him, kill him.  [LAUGHS.] Kill him.  [.]  SAPOCHNIK [ON PA.]: And camera, three, two, one, action.  [YELLS.]  Instead of it being a death like that,  it's just a before you even get to be surprised.  FURDIK: Got it.  SAPOCHNIK: Let's just practice dropping that knife.  Ready. There. Okay, that's good.  That really helps.  You should be on him all the time.  Yeah.  FURDIK: Miguel, he showed me the way.  Move from A to B.  It looks like easy, but  it definitely is not so easy.  So sometimes I realize be actor is not easy to be,  is better to be stuntman. Heh.  SAPOCHNIK: Three, two, one, action.  Stab him.  Good. Action.  Stab him.  [GRUNTING.]  ASSISTANT: Rolling reset, thank you.  Back to ones.  SAPOCHNIK: Ready? And three, two, one, action.  Drop.  And now turn.  Look up. Down. Stab him.  Action.  Action.  Three, two, one, action.  Cut.  [WOMEN VOCALIZING.]  SARAH: We've been doing night shoots.  I can't remember what week this is.  You wake up, quickly get showered, drive to location,  shoot all day, get back on the minibus,  quickly try and get some sleep, wake up.  It is like Groundhog Day.  If anybody ever says:  \"How's it going, Sarah?\" I feel like saying  [LAUGHING.] I'm broken.  We feel like vampires, don't we? I mean, seriously.  Everybody's just gray, aren't they?  MAN: Just run it through once, so I can see it.  SARAH: Unit call was at 8 p.m.,  we're supposed to wrap at 6 a.m.  We don't ever wrap early.  But there's a rumor going around that we might wrap at 3.  When people start rumors like that, it's, uh  [LAUGHING.] It can only get  So I'm really disappointed, if we're still here at 6.  FINLAY: When does Lottie get here, to be an extra?  SARAH: My mother flew her over, so that we can watch Lottie  being filmed for the day.  I haven't seen her for three weeks.  And there's been all this snow.  I've really struggled this shoot, actually.  [SIGHS.] It's hard.  It's hard being a mum.  You know, I missed her Mother's Day, um assembly,  and I missed her Easter bonnet parade.  In the grand scheme of things, you say it's not that long,  but when you're living each day, it is a long time.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: I need checks on Walkers, thank you.  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: just asked we make sure we  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: We're rolling away.  And action.  Cut. Got it, lovely.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: That's a cut.  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: That is a wrap, good night.  - It's a wrap! - [PEOPLE CHEERING.]  It's a wrap.  I hope. It's a wrap.  MAN: Guys, thanks very much for the last few months,  have an excellent Easter, enjoy yourselves,  get some rest, party hard, come back fresh.  FINLAY: Do you know what you're going to do today?  I think I might go and film at the Belfast  The Belfast Game of Thrones show.  [LAUGHING.]  [.]  Through love I've learned three things   SARAH: I love your beautiful haircut.  sorrow it brings   My fair girl   - FINLAY: Who is it? - LOTTIE: The Night King.  And Jon Snow.  Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh   WOMAN: Lottie. That's a very exotic name.  Some people say   Start fasting   Break my heart   GOWER [LAUGHING.]: She's, like, dragging it.    Still try and date them   -  Survive you  -  Ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh   [.]      Is this Roman, then, this thing?  Throw him to the lions, that sort of thing?  FINLAY: You weren't here on a previous shoot?  No, no. This is a first time for me.  Every year before, \"No, you're not going to Spain.\"  There was never anything to do.  MAN:   It's supposed to be 'round the outside  where the Unsullied are, you know.      I don't know what I'm doing here.  You boys could have done it in your spare time.  [LAUGHS.]  There we are, Jeanie, that's it.  I don't think it's worth doing the machine,  we may as well just run it out of the bags.  In Season 7, Jaime was in King's Landing  and a snowflake landed on his hand, didn't it?  So that allows you then to put little bits wherever.  There isn't going to be much snow apparently,  so it's just me.  Not too much, just to say that it's blown in  and stayed.  Yep, that does it for me.  FINLAY: It's award-winning snow, Del.  - Does that mean anything? - REID: Yeah, it's great.  They brought the Emmys to set so everybody could have  their photograph taken with them.  It's the first time I've ever had  my photograph taken with the Emmy.  Not that I'd show anything, \"This is my Emmy.\"  I've got a certificate, we got the original  We had to pay for it, but, you know,  I don't mind paying for it. You know, so, yeah.  I was part of the Emmy award-winning  So, yeah. But you don't show that, do you?  It's like having a forklift license.  [LAUGHING.]  [.]  CAULFIELD: It's very hard to keep the cast quiet,  because when in Spain, you must eat and drink.  They're going to be out and about,  and so we brought in a few ringers.  We have The Waif coming in, because so many people think  that Arya is dead and The Waif killed her.  We have Jaqen, who's also another  House of Black and White character.  And we have the Night King here.  Not quite sure what he would be saying.  So they won't know what's happening.  It'll be a big surprise no matter what.  [.]  Jon Snow is here!  GREY WORM: You are not here to speak.  I've had nothing to do but think  these past few weeks  about our bloody history.  There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.  And who has a better story  than Bran the Broken?  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  HARINGTON: It's weird, I've come out basically as decoy.  It feels weird being here and not actually filming.  When all the Spanish fans shout Kit,  they shout, \"Keet! Keet!\"  So the rest of the cast have now dubbed me Keet.  FINLAY: Keet!  HARINGTON: Keet! Keet!  WOMAN: Please, please, please, please.  Hi.  [FANS CLAMORING.]  [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING.]  HARINGTON: Hello.  [FANS SCREAMING.]  FAN: Sophie. Sophie!  Okay.  [LAUGHS.] I never saw this in all of my life.  So it's like, uh like, uh  [FANS SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY.]  Like a real star, how can you live in this life, you know?  Everybody recognizes them, so.  [FANS CHEERING.]  Okay, we can come there  and just give them a couple sign, yeah?  Okay, come on.  [.]  I would like to see if they recognize who I am, you know?  [BOTH LAUGH.]  [SHUSHING.] Please.  You know who I am?  CROWD: Yeah! Night King.  - Ah! Yes! - FAN 1: The Night King!  [CROWD CHEERING AND CLAPPING.]  - Where is my? - FAN 2: Winter is coming!  Where is my army? Yes.  FAN 3: I hope you win the war.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  FAN 4: You are the best, man.  Hey, my friends, look at this. Look at this. My Lord.  - Say something! - What?  - Say hi. - Hey!  Game of Thr  [BOTH LAUGHING.]  - Winter is coming! - Winter is coming!  Yes! Yes!  [.]  [FANS CHEERING.]  MAN [ON PA.]: That was Vlad the Night King's last-ever shot  on Game of Thrones.  [ALL CHEERING.]    [.]    RILEY: The best moment for us  is actually just before the cameras arrive.  When we have it to ourselves for a minute.  When it's quiet, and you can feel the set  has a personality of its own,  and it's all dressed and ready to go.  That's when I love it.  There's some mighty doors.  MAN: Twenty-nine weeks, four days.  RILEY: Twenty-nine weeks, four days.  Not that you're counting. Twenty-nine weeks.  RILEY: Not bad for seven months' work.  You built a city in seven months.  I honestly can say I could not have worked harder.  I really have given this everything I have.  And I love it when you see people go up  and they do this, you know?  The minute that the camera arrives,  and the machines and lights and hundreds of people come in,  they use it as they need to.  We're quite shy people,  we just want to be able to do our work and leave.  I don't think the actors would even know who I am.  That suits me just fine.  MAN: Well, I'm the carpet man.  Apparently, there's some looters coming.  My scene is to frantically bring the carpets in  as quickly as I can and close the shutters.  I've got the lovely maiden across the way,  I'm trying to get her attention.  She's otherwise occupied.  I'm just having a little contemplative moment,  enjoying the sunshine.  And then, yeah, all panic sets in.  But I'm a bit precious about my pots,  you might have noticed.  I want to get them all off the balcony.  ASSISTANT [ON PA.]: Hello, can everyone hear me?  You have to imagine right here today  that this is like alarms going off.  There are air raid sirens.  You guys are trying to get into the Red Keep,  which is over there.  Welcome to King's Landing. Let's go.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Action!  ASSISTANT: Go, go, go.  [PEOPLE CLAMORING.]  ASSISTANT: Good job, reset.  MAN [ON PA.]: Golden Company, forward march.  Left, right, left, right, left.  Halt.  That's mark.  CAULFIELD: There's one, two, three  [SUCKS AIR.] Oh, my God, Monday is four weeks away  from the end of principal photography.  Oh, my God.  FINLAY: How are your days looking?  - Are they easing? - No.  No, we're actually in  probably almost I wouldn't say the toughest time,  but not the way we all thought we would have our  spend our golden days at Game of Thrones.  What the fuck was I thinking?  Which is what I'm gonna put on my tombstone.  Morning, morning.  MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please.  Listen up. So as you all know,  Sam and his team have been rigging an explosion,  and when we have shade, we will blow this.  - CAULFIELD: So we can stay here, right? -   -  -         MAN: Can you look after Building 1, yeah?  You know Building 1, outside the front? Yeah?  That's it then, guys. Let's get to our stations.  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: Here we go.  [EXPLOSIONS BOOMING.]  CAULFIELD: Holy shit.  McCRUM: We haven't had a chance to look at it yet,  so we've only seen the building site so far.  It's the only place you can't wait to get over  to watch all the men get burnt.  There you go, cheers. Thank you.  Okay, what can I get you?  We've only got the wee ice lollies,  on the board you'll see.    You can't beat a Pear Picking Porky.  Completely cleaned out of the ice pops twice today.  I never thought I was gonna see this much heat,  - feel this much heat. - Complain about it so much.  And complain about it so much, yeah.  We like the cold. We prefer the cold than the heat.  Thank you so much.  Free wave.  That's brilliant, you can turn them 'round  and somebody's up there spinning it manically.  There's going to be projectile vomit everywhere.  I mean, you couldn't write it, could you?  Let's put a big, massive Ferris wheel,  and actually not tell anybody  that we're putting a Ferris wheel there,  you know, amongst all the discussions  about the big weekend and our set over there and filming.  Oh, no, they built the fucking London Eye.  [PEOPLE CLAMORING.]  [SCREAMING.]  WOMAN: Cut there.  - MAN: Reset. - WOMAN: Reset, please.  MAN: Reset.  McCLAY: Oh, yeah.  Do you know what club sandwich means?  Do you know what club sandwich means?  Chicken and lettuce under bacon, that's what that is.  - I didn't know that. - It's an acronym?  Yeah, chicken and lettuce under bacon.  - Learn something new every day. - Boom. Every day's a school day.  WOMAN: Rolling!  MAN: We're rolling. Quiet, everyone.  [WOMAN SCREAMING.]  [YELLING.]  [WHISTLE BLOWS.]  MAN: Have we got a fake head hanging around?  Yep. Any severed head will do.  Chow, why in the fuck are you wearing that Bolton jacket here?  Let me see this?  That's shite. Get out of here.  [LAUGHS.] How are you, man? You all right?  CHOW: I'm shaking your hand.  [LAUGHING.]  Fucking Boltons, man.  Aye, you didn't think.  You didn't fucking think about wearing that jacket, did you?  [.]  McCLAY:   ASSISTANT: We're rolling.  McCLAY: As soon as they shout rolling, I'm preparing.  And action, I'm in Westeros.  ASSISTANT: Action!  [ULULATING.]  McCLAY: You know, you can only push a man so far, I think.  You can only push his House so far.  It doesn't matter how good he is, you know?  If their blood gets up. It's war.  This is vengeance for the Red Wedding,  for the Starks, for seven seasons  of taking shit from House Lannister.  So we're landing down in force,  and we're just gonna kill everybody inside the city.  Unfortunately. For them.  [.]  [SCREAMING.]  NUTTER: For the funeral scene, it's all about  blocking where everybody stands.  I work hard about preparation,  because I don't like to waste people's time.  And I want to spend more time directing actors.  FINLEY: Are you this prepared in all areas of your life?  No.  No, I'm not.  If you saw my apartment this morning,  you'd see that, uh,  that didn't get any preparation at all.  I have to have two cleaning ladies come twice a week.  It's, ah It's so awful. It's such a mess.  I want the journey to be just as positive as the end product.  That's important.  Because what you remember is the journey.    All the pyres and get people in the foreground for us.  We'll basically do the eulogy, the speech,  then all coming up to light the pyres,  they look at each other,  then drop down, light the pyre, cut.  We're going to match the last frame of this  to the first frame of that. Fill the frame  and send it to me and David before you go.  Yeah, good. Good morning, brother.  - How are you? - NUTTER: Good, brother.  - So you're just, you're dead. - I'm dead. I'm dead.  NUTTER: Everyone wants a pied piper.  Not to say that I'm the pied piper,  but I definitely can fake it.  You create your own world behind the camera.  You'll take the pin out,  and you're reaching down here. As you put it into his chest,  you look at his eyes, like, \"You're a Stark now,\" right?  - Yeah. - Then you stand up.  [EXHALES.] Okay.  - And then you go. - TURNER: Okay, cool.  So just give me like a couple minutes to get into it.  - NUTTER: The way we just did it? - ASSISTANT: Could we get  everybody on their marks for the reference.  NUTTER: Let's see here.  Here you go, my brother. You're here.  A bunch of wildlings behind you.  If you guys can all meet him there  NUTTER: I get pretty tired, but I get invigorated too.  I guess sometimes it's a bit of performance anxiety,  where I want to do a good job  so that everyone feels that, \"He knows what he's doing.\"  This is a dream job for a director.  After directing Seasons 2, 3, and 5,  I had to step away for a couple seasons due to back issues.  And I had a couple surgeries.  So I missed it beyond belief.  And coming back now, I appreciate it so much that  This show saved my life.  [.]  We're now going to talk about why we're here.  Everyone here, you've all lost mothers, brothers,  and friends, and sisters, and wives, and everything.  So background, it's all about playing that attitude  all the way through. Okay, ready? Here we go.  My father died in a car accident  when I was a year-and-a-half old,  so my mother and I grew up together.  She would listen to music, and I'd sing and perform  for her friends that would come over for dinner.  I wanted to be the next Barry Manilow.  In college, I realized that wasn't gonna happen for me,  so I said to myself, \"What else can I do?\"  And realized that my desire to move people emotionally,  I could do it by being involved in filmmaking.  NUTTER: Action.  Spirit move me Every time I'm near you   Whirling like a cyclone in my mind   Baby, I love you come   Come, come into my arms   Let me know the wonder of all of you   Could it be magic?   Oh, come on, come on come on   Come into my arms   Oh, let me know the wonder Of all of you, all of you   Baby, I want you now, now   Oh, now oh, now and hold on fast   Oh, could this be the magic at last?   Could it be magic now?   NUTTER: Now!  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  McCLAY: Mr. David Nutter.  [CROWD CHEERS.]  McCLAY: The atmosphere today when we done the big group photo,  that hit home.  I said goodbye to the Night's Watch.  I've known them for years.  McCLAY: We all have extras jackets,  and I managed to give Kit Harington one today.  He's now trying to give me money for it,  but I won't take the money,  because I just want to give  Jon Snow his jacket, big time.  So he'll never give me that money.  I don't want that money.  It's going to be very emotional for the actors.  I couldn't imagine what it's like  for them to finally say goodbye.  [BANKS CHUCKLING.]  [EXCLAIMING.]  We're in no rush this morning.  CLARKE: No, I know. You know what?  BANKS: It's Emilia's last day, we're in no rush.  Is there any part of you that's a bit relieved?  - Do you know what I mean? - BANKS: Yeah.  - Uh, yeah. - Like, not in a:  \"Oh, thank fuck that's over,\" but as in  like a, \"Oh, right, that's one thing  I don't need to panic about anymore.\"  BANKS: I'm tired.  Tired.  BANKS: I kind of had enough just now.  - Mm. - [CHUCKLES.]  - BANKS: It's that bittersweet - CLARKE: Yeah, exactly.  BANKS: Because my life's been on pause,  let's unpause it and get that garden fence painted.  Exactly. Yeah, for heaven's sake.  Put that picture on the wall, damn it.  But yeah, there's definitely an exhale of breath.  So many people involved in this.  You know, it's just people's everything.  It's kind of exciting to sort of think:  \"Oh, who am I without this, then?\"  I wonder.  Adjust.  I'm trying to remember the first time we put this on.  I saw a clip of that the other day,  when you were riding on that horse through Belfast,  and it was absolutely freezing.  And you were in, like, nothing but a slip.  Yeah.  No such thing as thermals back then.  [SIGHS.]  I'm not sure this wig's got much more life left in it.  CLARKE: Neither has the head underneath it, so  Oh, it's the last time.  BANKS: It's the last time.  Oh, that's really weird.  [.]  Gimme the ring   Kissed and told   Gimme something that I missed   Gimme the ring   A hand to hold   Wild and what it seems   Gimme the ring   Kill the king   When love is the law   Gimme the ring   Gimme dream child   And do you hear me call?   Gimme the ring   On the loan and on the level   Still on the floor   Gimme the ring   Sing the dream child   And do you hear me at all?   ASSISTANT: That was Emilia's last shot on Game of Thrones.  [ALL CHEERING.]  BANKS: This is my idea of hell, at the moment.  I hate goodbyes anyway, I'm not good at it.  I'll try to just sneak out the back door  and miss this bit out.  Hey now, hey now, now Sing \"This Corrosion\" to me   Hey now, hey now now sing   LISTON: Here's a bit of wood I could take home.  That's where we stabbed Jon Snow.  I'll never forget that one.  Well, old girl, cheerio.  Served us well.  Sleep tight.  Gimme the things That don't last long   Gimme siren, child   And do you hear me call?   Okay. Now I've got everything packed.  Like a healing hand   Just gimme the ring   [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  It's just fucking tele, isn't it?  Oh So this has been really quite hard.  [LAUGHS.] And, um, I think,  you know, some days we've really struggled to get through it.  I think if it wasn't for you guys and your morale,  that's really what has got us through.  But this is obviously a big end.  I know lots of you are going home  as of the weekend, and I hope  that we get other projects like this again.  BARRIE: I don't.  [ALL LAUGHING.]  Because I want to keep the team together.  So thank you, everybody. Thank you.  [ALL CHEER AND CLAP.]  McCLAY: So it's me, you, Big Johnny.  Shane Cavanaugh's coming in too.  All right.  I heard it's only 12 people doing it.  Yeah, there's only 10 Unsullied.  McCLAY: You all right, man?  There's very few of us in for this.  McCLAY: I was just told I have a feature  there at the very last episode.  So Jon's honor guard, I was like, no way.  - So - FINLEY: Do you think  you'll get seen on camera?  Eh, because it's such a tight scene  with less numbers, possibly, yeah.  Yeah. So, um  It'll be like, yeah, just point to me,  \"Dad, there I am. Look again.\"  And he'll be like, \"Yep. Again.\"  [LAUGHS.]  So it would be a brilliant way  to cap off the season.  2016, 2015.  I'm trying to find Andy McClay's first day.  Ah, there he is.  This is the first makeup look.  I was like, you'll never get a part if you look like that.  You'll have to change your expression.  And then we got Andy McClay.  Cold Andy.  It's as if it's Day 1.  You came in and you told me that your house had just burnt down.  Oh, yeah, the fire in the house.  I was like, and you're here for a makeup test?  Had a fire in the house.  You weren't late either.  No, I wasn't late. This is the thing, man.  Escape from the reality.  [CHUCKLES.]  - Right. - Look there, now.  Argh.  - And shoot. - Sorted.  SMYTH: Off you pop, off you pop.  Goodbye, Andy.  McCLAY: This is sinking in now, that it's my last day.  Just back to normal life now, after this.  Good morning, how are you? Nice to see you.  Kit, all right, man.  HARINGTON:   Ah, nice one, man. Nice one, man.  Do you want a Season 8 one?  A Targaryen dragon man with a direwolf head  in the middle of it, that's what we're getting for Season 8.  - Yeah, yeah, yeah. -   Yeah? I can get you one of them if you want one.  Yeah, man. Yeah. Some detail.      - Yeah, yeah. -   Sweet, man.  - Nice, man. - See ya.  Sweet, eh?    - I know, man. I know. - Last day.  Aw, what?  [LAUGHS.]  In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen,  I sentence you to die.  Grey Worm.  McCLAY: Grey Worm, he's totally gone,  and of course Jon's trying to save lives,  so him and Grey Worm have a standoff there.  I think that the Starks in the background  are in a very precarious situation,  because we hate Lannisters.  We don't care if they die.  But it's our king's command. If the Unsullied are  pointing their spears at him we're not happy with that.  DAVOS: Easy.  MAN: Set. Three, two, one, Action.  MAN: Cut.  ASSISTANT: Okay, cut there.  [EXHALES.]  So with that, that is a Game of Thrones wrap  on our good friend Jacob Anderson,  Liam Cunningham, and Kit Harington.  CROWD: Keet! Keet!  WEISS: Ten years ago you walked in to Nina Gold's office,  as a 12-year-old  [ALL LAUGH.]  And here we are now.  Your watch has ended.  And it has been a hell of a watch.  For us, for these people,  and for so many people around the world.  Thank you for being Jon Snow,  and thank you more than that for being you.  [ALL CLAPPING.]  HARINGTON: I feel like my heart is breaking.  I love this show.  [CRYING.]  More than, I think, anything.  It has never been a job for me.  It's been my life, and this will always be  the greatest thing I'll ever do and be a part of,  and you have been just my family.  I love you for it, and thank you so much.  [ALL CLAPPING.]  ASSISTANT Reset, please.  MAN:       McCLAY [SIGHS.]: Thanks, man.  [CLEARS THROAT.]  I'm choking up here, man.  Honestly. Um  It's what Kit was saying. Um  Even though I'm just an extra  in comparison to him being the main star,  um, it has  It really has changed my life.  [SNIFFLES.] The show  I didn't think I was going to get this emotional.  It has, it really has.  The past five years has been the best five years  It's been the best five years of my life.  So, um, I will miss it.  But it's always something that I'll be able to look back on.  [CLEARS THROAT.] So absolutely brilliant.  It's just It's hard to fathom  that I'll never be coming back to Game of Thrones.  MAN: All background back to TEC. Going this way.  McCLAY: Best thing I've ever done.  There are four white walls In every damn hotel   A light by the bed Stains on the floor   And it's here I will wait out the storm   CAULFIELD: It's hard saying goodbye to everybody.  There's too many people that you just want to talk to  and say how much you love them and thank them,  and you just can't.  I think that I was able to,  I don't know, to bring my philosophy of,  you know, love and camaraderie and family to the show.  You know, that's the way I just always treat everybody.  CAULFIELD: If people have Game of Thrones on their credits,  people know that person had to work really hard,  that person knew what they were doing,  that person created, you know, a magical world.  [SIGHS.]  There are red velvet seats   In the windowless rooms   A curtain to draw   And faces to please   And it's here I will wait out the storm   Killing time on the fringes again   Before the leaving   Before the leaving   McCLAY: Ladies and gentlemen,  welcome to Game of Thrones tours.  What is dead may never die,  but rises again, harder and stronger.  So guys, you're very welcome to Game of Thrones tours.  I'm gonna talk to you about this.  This is Carrick Castle.  Guys, Carrick Castle is not in Game of Thrones,  so we're just going to fucking drive on past Carrick Castle.  I'm going to take you to Stannis's camp,  what we're going to see  is all the lads laying low for their gruel,  then who's going to pop on?  It's Ser Davos Seaworth,  Hand of the King to Stannis Baratheon.  Easing himself onto camera,  that's me right there.  - [SHIVERING.] - [ALL LAUGHING.]  Wasn't even cold that day on set.  Acting, is what we call this.  Yeah? All right.  Here we come, we're coming around the corner  and we're gonna see Irish mists.  And we're coming up here now,  just around this bend.  Castle Black, ladies and gentlemen.  I guarantee that it's up there.  If you could see it, well done to you.  This American guy said to me, he said:  [IN AMERICAN ACCENT.] \"Hey. Hey, buddy.\"  [NORMALLY.] And I'm like, \"Yeah, what's up, man?\"  [IN AMERICAN ACCENT.] He said, \"How did the Troubles start?  Tell me, how did the Troubles start?\"  [NORMALLY.] I was like, \"Well, mate,  the Troubles first started when Jaime Lannister  pushed Bran Stark out the window.\"", "summary": null, "review": null}}
